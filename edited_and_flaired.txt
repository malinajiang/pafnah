t3_5cxhsr	1479148219.0	Pleinairi	shroom	[Request] Stressful situation, no furniture and no food in the fridge. Pizza would be a kind gesture of relief	A little bit of backstory, my sister moved me out here last July where she lives, because she sold the house that we were renting from her from under us, so we had to get out by.. The 4th of September. Anyway I had been staying with my sister and her husband for that time until we found an apartment. After getting an apartment, I have been relying on my sister for everything. Had to give up the car because it wouldn't make the two hour drive, and with no help getting stuff to and from storage, among a $950 rent for a 1 Bedroom apt there's a bill for roughly $130/month renting a storage from Uhaul.   It's been about five weeks since moving into this apartment and there still isn't any furniture here, and being without a car... I can't really get anything out myself. Trying to bring it up to my sister only brings up confrontation about how she's consistently busy.  It's just really depressing, with my only support system being two hours away, having a pizza would be pretty awesome if someone could spare it. I'd be extremely grateful, this is my fourth time without much luck sooo maybe fourth times the charm :)? I have pictures if that helps any at all. Anyway, thank you for hearing me out. If anyone could help out it'd be very appreciated, and would gladly give back to the community after everything is sorted out.

t3_5cswa7	1479080968.0	okuma	shroom	[Request] Underemployed social media moderator had a bad month, and is eating nothing but rice.	So, I had a really bad month in September, didn't get many hours, which made me strapped for cash in October.  I got about 650 NET payment in October, which was just barely enough to pay bills, rent, and get a few groceries.  My upcoming checks should be much better, but they're still a few days off, and I'm SICK of eating rice.  Been rice for like 2 and a half weeks now.  Throwing this out in the desperate hope that some kind soul would be willing to throw me a pizza.  I really don't mind about toppings, except I can't have mushrooms or spinach (I am effectively allergic due to gout) and I despise the spices they put in most Italian sausage.  I have Domino's, Pizza Hut, Marco's and Papa John's nearby.  If some kind redditor would be willing, I would be immensely grateful.	1479082881.0

t3_5ccd5w	1478835204.0	fozzywozzy	pizza	[Offer] Feeling stressed and overwhelmed about the election? Let me buy you a pizza.	Take a mental health break. I got you. Not sure how many requests I will get, but I will do what I can within reason. Many places have closed tonight in which case I will send you pizza tomorrow for the meal of your choosing.  *ETA: Priority to people who have been most directly affected by the election. Can't give away infinite pizzas.  ETA2 (12:30AM): Okay guys, I have sent out a bunch of pizzas and my funds are beginning to run dry. I'll try to keep going as long as I can, but I have also created a google form to share with my friends so that they can help pay for your pizza too. Please submit here if you want to receive pizza and you're willing to be funded by other non-reddit donors in my social circle. https://goo.gl/forms/crzltux21nrEocTr1 (Moderators-- not trying to siphon off your traffic or anything, is this allowed?)  ETA 3 (12:45AM): A bunch of people are posting stories about being freaked out by the election. I can't tell if that means you want pizza or not. If you want to share feelings and express solidarity, go for it, but if you also want pizza you have to explicitly tell me you want pizza. Thanks!  ETA 4 (7:20PM next day): Hi everyone. So happy I was able to help out and improve your days in this small way. I am feeling a bit overwhelmed right now with how much I have to get done pizza- and other-wise so I am still going to do my best to get you a pizza but I am also investing some of my energy in getting other donors involved and making this thing bigger if it's sustainable. Therefore, it may take me a little longer to order you a pizza. Please use the form I attached above so I can keep track of everything without checking reddit, and make sure to include your email address or a general schedule (there's a spot in the form) so that even if we send pizza on another day, it still reaches you. Stay safe. There are people out there who care about you.	1478910233.0

I moved to the UK one month ago from New Zealand to be with my long distance partner (who was my high school sweetheart a decade prior) so it's a big long romantic globe trotting journey.   Anyway I'm here in the UK now, have been for a month having sold up all my stuff. Unfortunately the applying for jobs situation so far has proved fruitless and the little money I have is drying up which is putting a strain on things.   Long story short I'd love to have a warm pizza not only to comfort me but as a nice surprise waiting for my partner when she gets home instead of the cheap thrown together meals I've been cooking for her.   <3	1478852856.0

t3_5ao5gj	1478062947.0	x_driven_x	pizza-gold	[Offer] Help me Help you, and I'll pizza you on Saturday.	**Edit 1:** I have chosen my intended recipient; I will post an update on Saturday to see if we successfully completed this offer / challenge.  I am seeking one individual who is willing to put in a little bit of communication effort between now and Saturday, in return for a pizza on Saturday.    Here's the details:  I spend way, way too much money eating out. So your job is going to be helping to motivate me to not eat out Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. I DO have food at home to cook, and I will allow myself a trip to the grocery store for an ingredient or two, but really... I get lazy or perhaps even a tad depressed and end up eating out just for convenience or other reasons and I want a fun way to try to combat that and get some good habits going.   Your time commitment would probably be a few messages a day, as is convenient and if I'm successful and don't eat out until Saturday, I'll give you a electronic gift card in the amount of $15-$25 (depending on how many people you need to feed) to either Papa Johns, Dominos, or Pizza Hut (your choice).  I promise to try really hard to not eat out to help you win (and me too); and this is not just something I am half-heartedly doing with no intention of holding up my end. But, this is a team effort and I need a few messages from you each day to encourage me / respond to my whining about having to cook and eat alone. Yes, I'm serious, and while this is mostly in good fun, I really do need this extra bit of motivation to stop eating out every meal, so we can both be winners here. I've given away at least a few hundred dollars in pizzas before, check my history, so you can be sure I'm willing to shell out for my half of the deal.  1) If you're interested, leave a note here or in a PM with how you'll plan to help me and make sure we're successful and maybe a little about yourself. If you PM, please at least post here that you are PMing me, as I like having a public record that the winner I chose was in fact, involved in the public offer.  2) I will pick someone probably around my lunchtime on 11/2, (I'm in CST); and I'll update the post when I do. I will try to respond to everyone and let you know if you were chosen or not, and I apologize in advance to those who I didn't choose.  3) I will pizza you Saturday after I wake up, assuming we make it that far!	1478105650.0

I lost my job on Wednesday and I've applied to at least 30 places since then. Fingers crossed I get a call this week!  I have no food in the house.

I don't like asking for help and I've already had to borrow money from my mother to make my car payment and I'm uncomfortable asking for more.   I've tried everything to keep my mind off of food today but I think I'm going to faint if I don't eat soon.

I get paid next Thursday. Like I said, I'm hoping I could get a pizza and have it last a few days.  I have a few bucks on hand, but I'm really trying to save that for gas. I drive for Uber on the side, so I'm hoping to use that bit of gas I get to potentially make money tonight. This week has been incredibly slow, though. I made $5 in two hours on monday, and $19.50 last night in 5 hours... Pretty bad, considering I normally average $20 an hour. I can't use this money because as I mentioned, I'm currently negative in the bank. -$80 to be exact.  My lunch break for my real job is at 3:00 today, and I'd really appreciate it a pizza. As I mentioned, it'd last me a few days. I'm off this weekend, so I plan to Uber drive until I'm no longer overdrawn, and then some. Planning on driving tonight when I'm off my regular job, and probably won't stop until I either hit a quarter tank of gas, or make enough to cover the overdrawn funds.  As soon as I could, I'd gladly return the favor.  EDIT:  /u/emk0626 helped me out. Thanks! Pizza no longer needed. :)	1477598926.0

Got the rest of the month to go through with no money and a dwindling food supply. No idea if we'll figure out a way to get by - tomorrow morning, we'll be contacting food banks and the like to see what we can do. This, on top of some huge arguments between my mom and sister over the weekend, and cigarette withdrawal (no cash and out of smokes) have my poor mom at her wit's end. I feel like something good to eat - pizza - would help her (and my sister and I, but I'm especially worried about her) keep her head up.  In mid-west Virginia. Closest pizza place is a Papa John's, but a farther away Pizza Hut would be cheapest. There's also a Domino's about the same distance as the pizza hut. In other words, any of these three work.  Thanks for considering, anyone. If more info is needed, lemme know.  Edit: Pizza has been received.	1477520196.0
t3_59631d	1477332837.0	cmcl	shroom	[Request] About to be homeless again. Could really go for some Domino's.	I was able, with some help, to lift myself out of some very hard times at the beginning of this year as shown in my post history, but unfortunately I lost my job again last month and am back in the same boat.  I have to move out of my place next week as I can no longer pay the rent.  I'm applying for food stamps again, but it would really lift my spirits to have a hot pizza delivered while I still have an address to deliver to.  There's a Domino's nearby that's decent.  I've never posted here before, is there any other info I need to provide?  I read the sidebar but the info site doesn't seem to be available.

t3_5905tk	1477249883.0	Joevahskank	shroom	[Request](US) More like holding Chicago and Cleveland hostage	Figured I'd break out of the sob story routine and try something new.  As we may have heard by now, the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians are meeting in the World Series this year. This is a historic moment for both teams, as they are both ending 60+ years of championship drought. Since I'm a Rockies fan, my loyalty is to the National League Champions, the Chicago Cubs.   Now, to the meat of the request - Baseball is a very superstitious sport. There are many pre-game rituals, good luck charms, and worshipful fans that may or may not actually influence the outcome of the game. Just so happens that I know a guy who has somehow correctly predicted every game since the playoffs have started. While the scores are only slightly off, it's safe to assume that this guy I know has his own voodoo going on behind the scenes.   For a pizza, I can "persuade" this guy to support a particular team and do his baseball magic. All I need from you is the team you support and the team you want to lose. As soon as the deal is done, I'll get in touch with my baseball guru and invite him over for pizza.   	1477330479.0

My princess parrot Nami has been my feathery baby since before I started high school. She's about 11 years old.

She's my little birdie, and I've had her for so long.   Even discounted by the kind vet, I still used up all my spare money for her clinic costs.

Thank you still for taking a moment to browse over this post, though!**  So, it's labor day and thought I would try this again as last time it didn't work out, sadly. No sob story, not going to starve, so if you really want to help someone out like that, we will be fine! :)  But the budget is spent for the week with payday in a few days, and there is chicken out again to thaw. Figured if anyone would be so kind as to offer me and my girls some pizza, that would certainly be a crowd pleaser.  And damn all of the TV shows that include pizza! I swear they are just enticing me further! Was watching an episode of the flash and they started chowing down on pizza and now I have this craving!   But truly, if any saint out there feels like sending me and my girls a pizza or two, it would be amazingly welcome. (My girls includes my three daughters and wife. The cat, while female, will sadly not be enjoying said pizza.)  Domino's is best, as they are close and deliver. But we are not picky! Will leave this open until we must get down to cooking that chicken.  Even if you can't help or decide not too, I still appreciate you taking the time to read all of this.

t3_50ph9e	1472763112.0	frozenflameinthewind	pizza	[Request] Springdale, AR - Could use some Cheesy Goodness to Ease Root Canal Pain	[No Longer Needed]  Starting last week I started to feel an unbearable pain in my right front tooth. After seeing my general dentist on Tuesday, I was referred to an Endodontic specialist to have a root canal performed yesterday morning. I had to endure about 4 injections of anesthetic one of which was injected very close to the problem tooth and hurt like 'h' 'e' double hockey sticks.   After the procedure I continue to be in unbearable pain until I was able to stop by the store and pick up some Aleve and Tylenol.  I feel much better now. My mouth is healing up nicely and I no longer feel any pain in the problem tooth. The painkillers have a tendency to make me very drowsy and it will be tough to make myself dinner tonight. I would definitely appreciate the opportunity to munch on some cheesy goodness tonight. Not with my tooth that is healing of course. Is there a kind redditor that would oblige?	1472839695.0

She has a great job, and works hard so that i can enjoy this time off. It certainly puts a financial strain on us, but is well worth the struggle.

Haven't been here in quite awhile actually, but tonight is one of *those* nights. The night before payday, when the freezer is stocked with the last package of chicken, and me and the family are a little sick of that.   If there is someone who needs it more, I hope you will find in in your heart to help them more. But it has been chicken this whole week, and it is on the menu again tonight. It just gets a little old.  We are a single income family of five in Jersey. So money is always tight. But we do get by, and I make sure my girls never go hungry. (Which is interesting in itself as the youngest, 16, is a vegetarian).  But this week has been a harder one than normal, and even if it is only something small for the girls, I would appreciate being able to give them something different for dinner tonight.  Thank you for reading no matter the case, and I hope you can find a smile or two in your day.   EDIT- ((For anyone reading, thank you for your kind consideration.

Looking for a hot meal to tide me over the weekend	This last month has been a good one for me - despite living out of a car for a week last month while I waited for my flight, I have finally made it to Gainesville with nothing but a pack on my back and my computer. I'm forever grateful to my hosts for helping me out of that jam and escaping an extremely emotionally abusive family. However, the job hunt hasn't been going too well (it's college season) and I've found myself penniless. While I do have some money coming in the form of security deposits and my participation in a UF study, those checks haven't come in yet.   The reason why I'm asking RAOP instead of my housemates is because while they have assured me that I'm not imposing on them, I'm part-Irish, raised Catholic, and thus have a guilty conscience. I feel they've already gone above and beyond for me, and that asking for a pie would be like hammering a nail into a coffin. On top of that, I browsed the hell out of /r/pizza/top and the one that did it for me was that ham and bacon one.   I'm the type of guy that loves to pay it forward, though, so when that money comes in, I'll be haunting this sub to make sure that karma comes back in full swing. Thank you for reading up on my plight!  EDIT: Post has been fulfilled! Great thanks to /u/ht00040!!	1471146311.0

I'm not even totally sure what I'm going to eat for the next week, as I only have a few packs of ramen left (I can probably scrounge up some change to get a few packs if needed), but tonight, I would just really like something better to eat. I literally went to bed hungry lastnight because I felt sick from the ramen noodles, and I *really* don't want any more.  On the plus side, I got an job-offer yesterday, which I'm *SUPER* stoked about! Unfortunately, it doesn't start until the 29th, so I'll be 'enjoying' ramen for a few more weeks yet.  Also, I got a pizza from someone on here last year (December, I think?), so that's why it's showing I received a pizza. If anyone can hook me up with either Domino's or Papa John's, I'd be happy to repay the favor in a few weeks when I have an income!  EDIT: Got pizza'd by a redditor who wishes to remain anonymous. Huzzah!!!	1471119033.0
t3_4xgldt	1471046050.0	purpleaquarius	shroom	Thank you kind stranger!! [Thanks]	I received a large pizza which can last us the week, on top of that a cart of groceries. I am so thankful for the kindness of this place. I was really scared about struggling with food, but now I don't have to worry for a long time. I made a new friend today, someone I will forever appreciate. I can not thank you enough for your act of pizza, and kindness. I am forever humbled by you. It's been a long time since I've cried happy tears, but today I did and I will never forget it. My boyfriend cried a bit too, we hugged it out and I know things will work out eventually. Thank you so much /u/RunawayOctopus. We both are so thankful. [Pictures for the person who helped me](http://imgur.com/a/IjlGQ)	1471054728.0

t3_4wimva	1470530488.0	sporkwitch	shroom	[Request] Veteran in hard times, hoping for something that's not rice or ramen. Rochester, NY, USA	I'm a USAF veteran going through some ugly times money-wise.  I'm not starving, I've got plenty of rice and ramen, but something to break up the monotony would be spectacular.  I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to have the roof over my head, and a friend mentioned this subreddit while trying to figure out what I could do going forward.  I'm in contact with the VA for the serious stuff, and if someone were kind enough to break up this rice and ramen monotony with a pizza, I would be incredibly grateful.  (Don't know if it matters, but from the sticky and the rules it sounds like you get some scammers, my identity can be verified here: https://keybase.io/sporkwitch )  EDIT: Not abandoned, still hopeful for pizza :)  EDIT2: Got pizza'd by /u/MagnetToMyBed !	1470876918.0

Lost my job nearly 2 months ago and I'm still looking for something, it's been tough but we've been doing alright. The only place I've heard from is a new pizza place opening up around the corner from me. They said they'll be in contact early this week so I have all my fingers and toes crossed. I've been lucky enough to score a pizza through this sub, so I thought I'd give it another go. Once I am financially able, I'd love to give back and hook someone else up with a pizza.  Thanks guys.   *edit - Had someone offer and then I didn't hear back from them. So we are still after pizza if anyone can help. Thanks RAOP!  (Launceston, Tasmania)	1470116878.0

t3_4vf278	1469928917.0	ls_2012	shroom	[REQUEST]No food, no money, and I haven't eaten in 2 days.	I posted on here about a week ago about a pizza I ordered which I ended up not getting but dominos still took my money and put my bank in an overdraft because they overcharged me. Now I'm desperate because I am dead broke, I have nothing to eat, and I still need to pay off the overdraft. I'm a student living by myself in New York City and I'm relying on odd jobs to pay for everything. I'm hoping to get back on my feet next week because I was called back for a second job interview and if it all goes well I could solve a lot of the problems with money I've been having. But right now I literally have nothing to eat and I haven't eaten since Thursday.  If someone does want to give me a pizza I would actually prefer if I got it tomorrow because I can try and stay hungry for a rest of the day (since there's only a few hours left) and have something to eat tomorrow. Thanks in advance.  Here's my post from last week for anyone who wishes to read it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/4um5e5/request_my_local_dominos_new_york_took_my_money/  Edit: Pizza received, big thanks to pinklavalamp!	1469999182.0

So I noticed this was a thing today, my friend is having his 21st bday party and obviously we are all pretty broke college students. There's a few snack bags for food but most of the money we spent on alcohol for all the people (about 50) coming. Obviously one pizza won't satisfy everyone, but even if its just for the birthday boy and those who helped set up it's greatly appreciated. Any pizza toppings are okay, preferred is bbq chicken or hawaiian or chicken bacon ranch and onion...but cheese or pepperoni is great too! I'm in Massachusetts. Not sure what else I have to put now but if I'm missing anything let me know in the comments! could use sometime in the next 10 hours of posting this :)	1469823943.0

t3_4u5kgz	1469229322.0	JoshNeedsALife	pizza-gold	Offering Dominos	Hi everyone. I'm offering a large pepperoni or whatever (one topping) pizza and a 2 liter beverage of your choice from Domino's.  It's *nearly* first come, first served- however I only want to buy for people that need it (Broke and no food, really rough week, etc) rather than just want it. I know I have no way to verify that, so please be cool. Due to rules on this subreddit, I won't be considering to any requests through PMs. Only posts here please. Final guideline, this is only for folks in the US.  I'm also a big fan of the email verification tool, http://rikbrown.co.uk/rop, so let's use that too please! Have a great day everyone, I wish you the very best!  -Josh  Also, if you have an email with a variation of the name "Arthur Ciara" you tried to scam me once, and I just saw a picture of imgur of you trying to scam someone else (after you apologized to me). You are a bag of dicks that makes it hard to do nice things for people who need it. I seriously hope your life becomes just a little more difficult than it already is. No, I don't want you to die in a fire, but having your car break down when you really need to go somewhere, or getting really sick before traveling would be about perfect.  Edit: it's been grabbed. I hope everyone has a good whatever time of day it is where you are. 	1469238439.0

[NO LONGER NEED PIZZA THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL AND I INVITE YOU TO MY NEXT WEDDING]   There's a lot of people on the new ROAP submissions that like, probably really NEED the pizza you may have to offer. I can tell you that I have a pregnant wife and a houseguest atm and while we do have groceries, I'd just like to give them pizza because it'd be pretty neat. Don't get paid till Friday so can't pizza them till that time.  Since my request is strictly out of *want* for a pizza and not out of need, please consider a needy post if you're in the 'za givin' mood. If you wish to gift me a pie, please let me know what I can draw you in the THANKS thread I'm gonna make for you, keeping in mind that I have the drawing ability of a 5-year-old.   In the past, maybe it was like 2011 or 2012 (?), I had gotten pizza'd by a chap who was the best, helped me out in a time of need. Just want to take a moment and thank this subreddit again, (whether or not I get pizza'd) for how awesome all of you are. Much love. 	1466874553.0
t3_4pamwk	1466602107.0	cheapalternatives	shroom	[Request] Finally out of rice & still have some potatoes, but pizza would be great for once.	Howdy, I just finished off my last cup of rice and will move onto my last bag of russet potatoes for the remainder of June. My summer session for school starts in July so my access to the school food pantry is limited until then, and I thought some pizza would be great to have (since I can't afford that kind of stuff at the moment.) Anything would be appreciated, since I'm really craving that cheesy goodness. Anyways cheers.  Edit: I just got pizza'd! Thank you Chad! I'll make sure to pizza it forward when times get better for me!	1466731502.0
t3_4oow88	1466263157.0	Triforceninja	shroom	[Request] Can anyone spare a pizza for this preggo and I'll return the favor later next month?	7 months preggo and we're having a rough month since my van broke down. We lost another source of income until later next month, so any money we had to make it until the middle of next month went poof. Usually we utilize the local food pantry, but without a car, we can't get there. While we do have canned veggies and noodles, a pizza sounds heavenly. I've been craving one for a bit and my two year old keeps asking for "Pia" soo, if anyone can help us out, I would be more than willing to return the favor around the end of July (when we're caught up) to show my appreciation. Since we live in a small town, the local joints and Pizza Hut are our only two options. Thanks for reading and thanks in advance!  Edit: We are very thankful and received a giftcard for a yummy pizza. Thank you, u/ForgotDeoderant!	1466275177.0

t3_4nyheb	1465860334.0	gswas1	shroom	[Request] Starving intern at can't make it until 1st stipend payout.	I was able to land a very competitive research internship at Cornell a few months ago, and I arrived a week ago. It's very exciting, and I am learning a lot. I'm working in a lab that studies tomatoes that sadly I cannot eat because they are *SCIENCE* tomatoes. And this is forbidden.   However, the last few months have obliterated my savings because I no longer receive support from my family because they do not approve of what I am studying. The last of my savings went into checking my bags at the airport to get here, which I wasn't worried about because part of my internship includes a food allowance. However, that food allowance doesn't come until Thursday and I'm almost out of granola bars (which I was smart enough to bring with me). I'd really love to eat something besides Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey Granola Bars (which with peanut butter and tortillas have been most of my calorie intake) if anyone wants to send some pizza to this starving intern trapped in a dormroom. I will pay it forward once my food stipend comes along. There is a dominos and a papa johns near me.	1465860949.0

Jumped through the hoops to order from GrubHub, because the Domino's site doesn't like where I live for reasons.  Then when I went to place the order, my card was denied.  I checked my account, and whammy -$20 because FreedomPop decided to bill me for ... something.  They're closed, my bank's closed, and I'm kind of irritated.  My account's empty and FreedomPop, which I used for two weeks and then cancelled, decided to reactivate my account, and bill me for the privilege, overdrafting my checking account, so what was supposed to be $0 is now $75.  At least I had a decent job interview today... hopefully I won't have to go anywhere until someone pays me.  Day 2 ... another good interview today at a different company ... here's hoping.  FreedomPop only gives you their customer service number when you cancel your plan.  They don't have it on their website.  I had to reboot, so ... lost it.  Sent an e-mail.  I'm not holding my breath.  Gonna go to the bank on Tuesday when I have work next.	1465600388.0

I will also post a thank you here when I can take a picture of my veritable bounty tonight :)  Hey guys. I'm just a guy from Falls Church VA looking for some dinner. I have negative balance in my account right now because I had to pay my roommates rent since they refused to. I have a credit card, but I don't feel comfortable using it, especially since I have to travel to Texas in a few weeks for my mother's wedding! (so happy for her).   I don't like just straight asking for things, but I have asked once or twice in this sub for other reasons (being honest, here).  I have a bunch of steam games lying in my humblebundle account that I'd be happy to offer in exchange for a pie. Papa Johns is having a 50% off day in my area right now with the code Nats50, and I love their mushroom swiss burger pizza. If anyone could make my day, I'd be so happy.

Thank you so much for your generosity and your kindness. I can't even describe how easy this makes getting through the rest of the day.  I've been struggling for a few weeks. I have a roommate that I don't like and can't deal with, I don't know what's going on in my future (moving plans are too wayward), work has cut my hours because of the dry season, payday isn't until Friday and most of that is going to bills (it's hard building a credit) and I'm hoping I'll have some money for grocery shopping for two. And being hungry, I've had a web page open for buying pizza that I don't really want to add to my credit but I hunger, and with pizza, I could save rations for lunch.  I got a weird gross lump in my throat from this. I don't like asking for things. But it's hard times, and I'd appreciate a warm pizza. I'll send you cute pics of my dog (who definitely eats better than us - gotta love bulk dog food). Ottawa, Canada, close to Pizza Pizza and Domino's. And one day, I'll pay it forward.	1465418290.0

I managed to give myself a splinter in my palm that I can't extract, cover myself in Rustoleum paint that won't come off the best pair of maternity pants that I own (total freak accident) and I found out that our tax refund is going to be delayed for another 8 weeks because of the type of return we filed.

Thanks for the kind words :)   Edit 2: thank you to the kind stranger that guilded me I've never had gold before! You're are too kind  Hey guys I've never reached out on here before but I often come and check out the posts even though I'm not really in a position to help myself.   The short of it is my 18 year old fur baby has been on kidney food for 2 years and meds for thyroid for the last year. She had been getting along pretty well up until Sunday when I could tell my friendly girl was not her self.  I got a Monday morning apt with our regular Vet and got blood drawn and a b12 shot as well as her blood pressure taken. Paid out about $250 for that.  Throughout Monday she didn't really eat or drink so that brings us to the emergency Vet today. She is receiving fluids and waiting on more tests and we're looking at about $2800 total if she starts pulling through and spends 3 days there recovering. I used the last bit of funds on my credit card this morning to put down a deposit and start treatment but that leaves me with pretty much no money for the week.   Honestly I have a few groceries in the fridge but just am so bummed I really can't bring myself to cook something for dinner. Would love a pizza for me and my mom to share while we try and figure out the next steps for our fur baby.  Thanks for reading 	1465345847.0

t3_4lskay	1464655479.0	mcspookypants	shroom	[REQUEST] Ypsilanti, MI, stuck at home pet-sitting and exhausted from medical appointments	For the last two months, I've been pet-sitting for a friend while he and his wife are visiting his family in Mexico. I take the bus to their place four days a week, for about two dollars a day, plus any expenses incurred to buy more cat food, litter, etc...  In addition to having three other cats to care for (in addition to my own three), this last month, especially, I've been running around taking care of my own medical appointments and my own transgender related legal appointments.   To make matters goofier, since my friends are expecting, they've decided to move to Mexico City, where they'll make the same money they were in Ann Arbor, but the cost of living is low enough to actually build a savings. Because of this, I was assigned with taking one of their cats in for vaccines and microchipping on Thursday, where an ear infection was discovered, so because she needs her medicine more than I'm over at my friend's house, I had to take the cat home with me, so she can get her ear medicine.   I'm disabled with a twisted spine and low vision, so my primary income is Social Security Disability income, with survivor's benefits, which is less than a thousand dollars a month. My friends are due back on Thursday, and I don't get my cheque until Friday. I'd be able to meet up with another friend for dinner, his treat, but since it's Memorial Day, the bus isn't running, and he can't come pick me up.   If you want to send me $15-25 to my PayPal for delivery, or a Domino's Egift card (I'm just two blocks from the original location), I can send pics of all the cats here -- even though it is hot and they are melting (except Mr Midnight, who wants to climb all over me for snuggles, right now). 	1464663751.0

Of course I'm open to anything else someone might have in mind.... living in Portland I have all of the major chains available.   I don't have much to offer in return :-/  thank you for reading.	1464561223.0
t3_4l6j4g	1464284792.0	KingGMY	PIF	[Request] I'm sorry, I'm getting a bit desperate.	I honestly didn't want to come here because I have been a member of this subreddit for a better part of a year. I have read a lot of serious, touching, and much more deserving topics here, and feel it's not really for people like me.  But I'm sadden to say, we don't have much to eat except 2 cans of beef stew. My mother is diabetic and needs to eat something or it will be another hospital bill we can't afford. I promise I will pay it forward as soon as I have the means.  EDIT: /u/arazilla, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I really hope I can pay it forward when I get paid and all the important stuff is taken care of.	1464311988.0
t3_4l4txs	1464261992.0	ht00040	pizza-gold	[Contest] $25 Domino's eGift Card for Supporter of Youth Baseball/Softball Game	**Edit:**  Well, that was disappointing.  Looks like I struck out on that one.  Can't hit a home run with every contest I suppose.  &nbsp;   Good morning! This will be my last contest for the week.  This past Sunday I watched a youth baseball game and made a quick offer before I had to leave for the game.  There wasn't enough time for anyone to claim the offer so I suggested Redditors that go to a youth baseball/softball game take a picture at the game with a piece of paper containing their Reddit name and the current date so they could be eligible for a future contest.  Well, that day has come, and it's time to collect your pizza.  Please post the youth baseball/softball pictures you have taken from earlier this week.  &nbsp;   This contest ends today at 4pm CDT.  &nbsp;   I will also want to have proof that a pizza meal was purchased.  The winner of this contest will be my 20th pizza recipient, so I'm hoping you are able to post a picture of the pizza you receive.  &nbsp;   **Reminders:**  RAOP requires 300 karma or more. I can't see your post if you have less than 300 karma.  Please do not send me a PM asking for pizza.	1464296609.0

I'm offering a large pepperoni or whatever (one topping) pizza and a 2 liter beverage of your choice from Domino's.    It's *nearly* first come, first served- however I only want to buy for people that need it (Broke and no food, really rough week, etc) rather than just want it.

Final guideline, this is only for folks in the US.     I'm also a big fan of the email verification tool, http://rikbrown.co.uk/rop, so let's use that too please! Have a great day everyone, I wish you the very best!   -Josh   Edit: It's been grabbed. Have a great night everyone! 	1464222740.0

t3_4kkpdd	1463953912.0	asmith1285	pizza	[OFFER] $20 e gift card to your choice of the big 3	So I've pizza'd previously, but as I am really just a glorified lurker (4 years, way less than the 300 karma for a pie), I have decided that I will offer a contest. Recently I was cut from 5 days a week to 2 days a week at work and so I have a bit of down time. So the rules are simple  1: Imagine you have an abundance of shipping pallets.  2: create a unique use for 1 or more of these pallets.  3: share it with the class.   The contest will end at Noon PST on Tuesday. At that time I will have my wife pick her favorite, be that  most creative, unique, plausible, whatever. She chooses the way she votes. (tip: she likes pictures/drawings)   I would appreciate photographic evidence of the winner enjoying said purchase.   (if anything is poorly formatted the blame Squarely rests on BaconReader)   12 hours left!!!    The wife has declared: diggitydingo To be the winner! She loved the different looks that were created with basically the same parts! I loved the idea of stacking them as high as possible, but I don't have a vote. I have pmed you so that we can nail down the details. 	1464121435.0

t3_4jw5z8	1463570414.0	ht00040	pizza-gold	[Contest] $25 Domino's eGift Card for Solving the Short Riddle	**Edit:** I wasn't intending to award an eGift card since time had expired, but perhaps there was a miscommunication, so in the end I did provide an eGift card to /u/rubynights  &nbsp;   **Edit:**  Times up.  Nobody was able to answer the riddle before time ran out.  &nbsp;   **Final Note:** I have a lot of Shimano gear.  My road bike has Shimano components and a bunch of my fishing reels are made by Shimano.  That is why I picked them and then picked bands and then songs to create the riddle.  Thank you to everyone that participated!  I had a blast and I hope you had some fun too.  &nbsp;   At about 8:23am CDT this morning /u/ForgotDeoderant asked for an explanation on why people were making their guesses and wanted to know the thought process.  Shortly after that /u/hiddenmoose made a comment indicating it was about 3 songs.  That is correct in that  is the first step in unlocking the riddle.  The comment was subsequently deleted and I assumed /u/hiddenmoose deleted it so it wouldn't help others.  I was sure /u/hiddenmoose was on the right track to solving the riddle.  **Hint #1:** The riddle refers to 3 songs.  You need them to unlock the next step.    **Hint #2:** The songs are: Zamboni, The Divided Sky, Walk on the Ocean  **Hint #3:** The songs were only the first step.  The name of the band will get you to step #2.  **Hint #4:** Today people have guessed: Martin Zellar, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Phish.  The three bands are: Gear Daddies, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Phish  **Hint #5:** I only have one name.  The keywords from the band names are: gear, sprocket, fish  **Hint #6:** I make gears, sprockets, and fishing reels  /u/rubynights was the first to guess Shimano at 8:43pm CDT.  When I did a Google search this morning with gear, sprocket, and fish they came up on the first page.  &nbsp;   **Edit:**  Starting at 8pm CDT I will start unlocking the riddle in about 5 minute increments to see if anyone can figure it out with a little help.  If not I will reveal the answer by 9pm CDT.  **Edit:**  *Note to self: they aren't quite ready for riddles...*  &nbsp;   Good morning! Today you can earn some pizza by solving my short riddle.  &nbsp;   **Riddle:**  I have only one name, and I like to ride my Zamboni across the divided sky so I can walk on the ocean with you.  Who am I?  &nbsp;   This contest ends today at 8pm CDT. I will PM the contest winner to give them the eGift card information.  &nbsp;   I will also want to have proof that a pizza meal was purchased.  &nbsp;   **Reminders:**  RAOP requires 300 karma or more.

My wife and I were staying at her mother's when she got a new man and decided we needed to go. Since that time we've had to stay at different places because there's no room for us both. This put a huge strain on us because I'm the only one working and supporting us separately is so much harder especially while trying to save money for an apartment. It's been hellish not having her around and this week I didn't have the money for groceries for me, so I'm at work with no lunches everyday. Heard there were some good folks on here. Thought I might try my luck. Either way it's nice to share a little of my weight. Thank you guys.  EDIT- My wish was granted by a sacred scrotum. u/holyballsack thank you so much.	1463598355.0

t3_4jbup1	1463240160.0	ImFuckinDrunk	shroom	[Request] (Northeast Ohio) Almost caught up on rent, loan payments and other bills, but apparently I'm not as relieved as I thought...	As the title suggests, I've been struggling with staying on top of all my bills lately. I've dedicated the past month or so to fixing that and I've been very stressed and very broke. I think my stress hit a breaking point last night though when I woke up about an hour after heading to bed to find that, after going to bed, I opened all my windows and both of my cats had gotten out. I don't remember doing this at all... and I know it wasn't someone trying to break in. They're home safe though after I stayed up until 5 am scouring my apartment complex.   So, I guess what I'm asking for is someone to help me just relax today with some pizza. I only have $20 for cat food, human food, and gas money for work until I get paid next Friday.   Edit: Thank you for the Pizza Hut gift card, /u/MechanicalBayer! You definitely made my weekend!	1463253132.0

t3_4j3ow7	1463098134.0	ChickenDarkness	shroom	[Request] Having a really rough time lately with depression, don't have much food, could use a pizza	REQUEST FULFILLED!  I've been pretty down lately... things are not going too well for me. My fiance and I have been living his his parents for a month and a half or so now, and it's been rough. His parents are very back and forth between acting ok and treating me like a total outsider... In addition to my normal depression, this has been really hard for me.. and I could REALLY use a pick me up in the form for pizza. :(  To specify, his parents have always been like this, but now that we are living here it is really getting to me. There is some other stuff going on too that I just don't want to talk about...but I'm willing to PM whoever donates pizza with that info.  We don't really have much food in the house either besides a few packets of instant mashed potatoes and a frozen meal. To be honest, I haven't had the energy to cook anything that ISN'T a frozen meal lately... and he is at work until 11pm or midnight tonight, so I can't go buy food even if I wanted to.   It says to add general location, so I'm about 30 minutes southish from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.   Anybody willing to send me a pizza, I'd be really grateful. I've never made a post here before so I have no idea how the process works.	1463103047.0

Great job!  &nbsp;  Good morning! This will be the last offer for the week before I take off for the Mother's Day weekend holiday.  My brief PSA to you before revealing the offer: Mother's Day is this Sunday.  For many of you your mother doesn't need "things", she just wants time with you.  If you can't spend time with her this weekend please call her and talk with her on Sunday (no, texts don't count).  Giving our Moms some of our time is the least we can do.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Today's offer is a $25 Domino's eGift Card to the Redditor that can guess the location from these pictures: [one](http://i.imgur.com/2tMSo6P.jpg), [two](http://i.imgur.com/fE1b1NA.jpg?1), [three](http://i.imgur.com/qDSuxVC.jpg).   &nbsp;  This one is a little more tricky unless you've been to the location.  Therefore, I will answer questions, but only questions that are upvoted so it shows at least 5 points.  I don't think downvoting is allowed here so folks can't thwart each other.  Questions, however, are a double-edged sword.  They might help you, but they will also help everyone else.  &nbsp;  The first Redditor to guess the location will receive the eGift Card. I have a feeling this will either go really fast or take a few questions to narrow down.  Good luck to everyone! &nbsp; All posts must be public.  &nbsp;  This offer ends today at 5pm CDT. I will PM the recipient to give  them the eGift card information.  I will also want to have proof that a pizza meal was purchased.	1462447625.0

It comes and goes without notice, but I am feeling the end of a month long spell. I'm not at the level where I need medication, but even my moderate depression can feel heavy on my heart.   I am offering a pizza to one (maybe two) redditors who have faced depression in the past or are currently facing depression. I'm not asking for a photograph of your prescription bottle or a personal anecdote detailing your life.   I'm asking for you to write about something you have done in the past week to try to make your life better. It can be a small act like walking your dog more often because the weather is nice or maybe you called your grandma to thank her for the socks she sent. No bummers. I want tales of hope!  I'm not focusing on the intensity or ingenuity of your actions – I'm looking for sincerity.  You can PM me if you don't want to share publicly, but make sure to post here to prove you aren't banned. I'll be making an assessment tonight around 7pm EST.   Stay Posi out there, guys.	1462066352.0

t3_4fzsvb	1461349785.0	DestinyInDepth	shroom	[Thanks] Thank you Minnick85 and everyone else	A special thanks to Minnick85 and anyone else who has ever helped someone not just on here but anywhere..people like you are the reason why their is still hope, love and compassion. I will be telling my kids where their dinner came from in hopes that they will remember this and when they get older they will remember where they came from and hopefully be in a place to help others...So thank you Minnick85 and everyone else who has made someone's day better!	1461458236.0
t3_4fyr75	1461336297.0	DestinyInDepth	shroom	[Request] I could use a small amount of help...	No longer in need of pizza, I was given an awesome pizza from Minnick85!     I'm not trying to be a Debbie downer or anything like that, in fact, I'm sure their are people here that are in a worse position than me and if that's the case please defer to them first.   With that said it's been rough lately. I am a military veteran (Marine Corps) with a college education and I'm married with 2 kids. However my degree has gotten me a $14/hr job which I do enjoy most days but I only make 800/biweekly and my rent is 800, electric is around 100, car payment with insurance is 330, gas is 150/80 (winter/summer) and food is 400 phone bill is 90..so as you can see its more than what I make and the state says I make to much for foodstamps because they are including the 250 a paycheck that goes to taxes (go by gross not net).   but whatever my point here is that my electric was turned off for 3 days and I had to sacrifice food to get the power back on so we are kinda screwed this weekend. We have money coming from family out of state but it wont get here until next week.   If anyone could help out that would be cool, I'm not asking for much just $10 or something to get us through today or tomorrow. I have $8 and I can stretch that for 2 days. I can verify everything I've said and also if their are others who are in a worse spot they need to be taken care of first. 	1461458108.0
t3_4ftocp	1461254974.0	09cjones1	pizza	[Offer] $20 Papa John's or Domino's - Help me pick a song! (details inside)	For part of a final project, I have to do an interpretive dance about schizoaffective disorder (I know, I know, really random...).  If you don't know what it is, to put it very simply it is schizophrenia + bipolar or schizophrenia + depression.   So... I thought it would be fun to see what kind of songs you guys could come up with that would work for that!  I'm thinking something chaotic with high parts and low parts.    I can do a Papa John's or Domino's gift card, whichever the winner prefers. I will choose the winner around 9:45 PM tonight (I am Mountain Standard Time).

t3_487980	1456704592.0	BisFitty	shroom	[REQUEST] So pissed off at Walmart right now! -.-	REQUEST FULFILLED! Thanks to /u/Astr0nauty! :)    Money has been pretty tight lately, and morale has been pretty low. So when I got paid 20 bucks today on paypal, I thought I'd surprise my wife with her favorite pizza. I proceeded to head to Walmart.com to buy an egiftcard to Dominos. That was when everything went downhill :(  The order went through, I got my confirmation email, and was waiting for my e-gift card to arrive. Instead, I got an email from walmart saying there was "Unfortunately a billing verification issue" despite being able to take my money out of my account with no issues. Now, I'm being told the order has been cancelled, cannot be fixed, and I have to wait up to a week to get my money back.  I really hate to come on here with a sob story, begging for pizza, but I'm feeling super defeated today, and I'm hoping there is some kind random stranger out there that can help bring a little warmth and brightness to a pretty dismal weekend.  I live in NE Florida, and have reasonable access to all of the big 3. While Dominos is her fave, neither of us is picky! :)   Cheers, and thanks for your time :)	1457309325.0

I had to put down my wheaten terrier Shredder over a week ago and I've finished grieving over him but I think it would be fitting to celebrate my memory of him with a large bacon and sausage pizza from a local Dominoes. I think it's fitting because I named him after a character from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which I really loved at the time, and those turtles love pizza.

t3_46e6xu	1455791947.0	Madavo	PIF	[Contest] ezpz pie(s?)	I've had requests filled and never put back into the community. My random payday comes in a few hours and a few randoms will have a  few pies with me once my shift is off.   Few rules, no effort. when I order my pizza for the hangover cure I'll grab a few more pies and raop them based off a 20 sided dice I had after spending too much on magic cards last paycheck. Drop a number(1-20) as a comment and why that number popped in your mind( it doesn't really matter why, I wont be re-rolling but some backstory is neato), and I'll roll as long as my meager funds can manage. (honestly 2-3 large boxes of foodstuff from one of the big 3, but we'll see) I haven't thought far enough ahead to have duplicates but hopefully it doesn't come to that   -Edit Wow that's a ton of responses so I'll be going by first come first serve. The 20d I had isn't in the box i thought it was but a rng program rolled an 18 and it looks like /u/WalterGrove was the first to pick, pm'd! I might have been a bit overzealous on the amount of winners but after bills I'll probably roll another tomorrow.	1455881409.0

t3_45xfsu	1455555796.0	yyajeet	shroom	[Request]Something more than ramen for a change	I really hate doing this, and I hate it even more having to do it on an account that's not a throwaway simply because I don't want my friends and family to know I'm having as difficult time as I am.  Basically, I'm struggling.  I recently moved to New York for a job that didn't work out and am out of money to eat.  I've been living off ramen and water for a little over a week now but could really use something more substantial -- I would kill for the chance to actually be full on something other than noodles and broth.  what little cash I do have left is used to get to and from job interviews so I don't have to walk 10+ miles a day in the cold to get to and from Manhattan.  Thank you for your consideration.  Edit: Pizza received!  Thanks go /u/Old_Caroline for his generosity.  Also shoutout to /u/purplemudkip who also messaged me offering!	1455677495.0

I can finally move around again but haven't eaten in threes days and am finally read to eat. I have the motel for two more nights and then I'm checking into a sober living home. I will literally cry uncontrollably if this works. But even if it doesn't, at least I'm not a slave to heroin right now, at this moment. And it's painful but beautiful. Sorry for the sob story.

Exactly.  And since we're all everyone, let's make it something everyone can do: guess the number I'm thinking of.  The mods have been given the number I'm looking for so, by default, I'm disqualifying everyone listed on the mod team.  Fair is fair, right?  All non-moderators have to do is guess the number I'm thinking of between 1 and 1,000,000 (whole numbers only; no decimals or percentages will be accepted).  We're using *The Price Is Right* rules for this game.  Only one entry per username and users must qualify by the rules written on the sidebar of this subreddit to be eligible.  Multiple entries will void all of your entries so guess once and be patient.  I'll keep this going until **5p pacific this Friday, February 12th** to give everyone a chance enter.  Hopefully this makes one of your weekends better than the last.   Peace, unity and your mom,     tnl-    **WINNER: die07**     You guessed 407398 when I was thinking of 410790. Bob Barker would say "close enough" and so will I!  Enjoy your $20 card towards Dominos's, my cheesy friend.      And THAT brings me to the end of my five days of pizza.  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.  Remember, be excellent to each other.	1455473339.0

t3_44haw5	1454781930.0	jdlara21	shroom	[Request] My boss made me grab my ankles this week, and I'm broke	So I'm just a shitty 19 year old IT boy who dropped out of college to pursue his career. I work in a small company (about 12 people) with really messed up dynamics as far as inner workings. My direct deposit supposedly "hasn't gone through yet" (it's my fifth month with the company) and I have to get my checks from my boss.  They promised me 23k. I was offered 21. Whatever. Starting job, I'm young with no experience, whatever. Then the checks started coming in late. My boss is never at the office. I got relocated to a service desk for one of our clients that isn't in our headquarters so I don't see my boss to collect my paycheck. I ask him if I can get it, he says he'll leave it at the office. I come in, the check isn't there. He isn't there.  I needed that money. My car is in dire need of a mechanic, it can barely take me to work in the morning. I can't eat, I have no money to get food. I have ~$2 in my checkings and not much more in my savings.  We haven't even gotten our W2s yet. I just feel so helpless. Honestly, I'm not even looking for pizza. Well, maybe. I could eat anything at this point. I'm so hungry. I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm just ranting at this point.  Thanks for reading.    Edit: All this legal advice. Still broke. Still hungry. gg  I truly am grateful though. I'll see what i can do.	1454867309.0

t3_442q0d	1454544799.0	thenewloser	pizza-gold	[Offer] Free pizza (1/5)	A few years ago I ran into some funds unexpectedly and gave them out here in the form of everyone's favorite meal -- PIZZA!  Some time has gone by and I've decided to do it again.  I'm going to give away $10 a day in e-gift cards to any one of the top three pizza places of your choice.  Now to the big question, how?  Since I'm really unoriginal these days, I'm going to just run everyone's name through [random.org](https://www.random.org) and see who comes out on top.  Since we're here on the west coast, I know a lot of people are looking for dinner sometime soon across the US so for today, **this contest will be open until 6p Pacific.**  After that, I'll copy all screen names that comment below into a list and let the randomness of it all decide a winner.  I will send the winner a PM and they will have 15 minutes to respond or I will move on to the second person on the list.  Sound fair?  Good!  Best of luck people.    Peace, unity and your mom,     tnl-  **WINNER: jojo913**     Good job doing almost nothing, joj913!

t3_43uxhs	1454430297.0	Battlingdragon	shroom	[Request] Lost my job, everything is either frozen, canned, or huge	As the title says, I lost my job three weeks ago. To save money, I've been eating mostly canned or frozen food that we had bought previously. When my fiancé and brother get home we cook something, but I'm on my own for lunch. You can only eat Chef Boyardee and Hot Pockets for so long before you go crazy. All I want is a 16" pepperoni and bacon pizza so I can eat something else for a couple days.

I was kicked out of my parent's house a little over a month ago. My roommates got into a drunken fight with each other at 3 in the morning. I'm bummed out and stuck at home on my day off from work. Nobody's here. All I have are my video games and my nearly depleted bank account. Nothing is going well for me at all this month.

I liked his story about working at the shelter and I've worked for nonprofits myself. I'll definitely do a contest again in the future when I have some more extra cash. :) Thanks for all your stories!**  $20 to wherever you want. I'm located in US. Chains are obviously the easiest. I don't know how to give overseas but if someone shows me and it's not too complicated, I'm willing to do that. I received from here when I was a broke college kid in a very stressful financial situation.  I work in concert production and I can say I love going into work. Every job has good days and bad days, but I wouldn't want to be in any other industry. I whole-heartedly believe that most of the time it is better to live modestly in a job you love rather than make a lot of money and still not being happy.  Tell me what is good about your job! What makes you smile? Are your coworkers fun? Do you like your customers? Do you just really like doing math for your job? Does your coworker have a funny dog?  Bonus points for cool or funny pictures. I want to spread the joy! (Extra pizza to a band on tour who wants to take a new lighting tech.

We have a little bit of money to last us a few days, until our paydays, but not much.    Also, my mother just passed away yesterday,  (Lewy Body Dementia) and not really in the mood to do much of anything, including cooking tonight.    Would appreciate a pizza for tonight, so one less thing to worry about, at least for one night.  Dominoes gift cards often work best for us, as one is very close by.	1454115394.0

So I'm broke, I had to spend the last of my cash to take an ABC class (and feed the animals, but that's not exactly something I can decide not to do), but the training means I've got a definite job starting next week. I want to celebrate by not eating another dinner of rice, clementines, and water, and I can't afford to go drinking either, sooooooo next best thing is pizza from a stranger? I could give some book/music/movie recommendations based on stuff you like (regardless of whether you send a pizza my way, no reason not to share cool stuff), but I don't really have anything else to offer. But yea, thanks for reading, hope you have a great day!      Edit: God damn I feel bad asking for food vs other people's posts that I've read. I'd appreciate pizza but I understand how low priority I am vs others.	1454095879.0

t3_42cr6a	1453583595.0	jarrettbraun	PIF	[Contest] Super Bowl & Creativity, for a bitter fan...	**CONTEST CLOSED** I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed, but I blame myself. Maybe I put it up too early. Maybe I expected too much out of people. Maybe the community is dying... Whatever the circumstance, I'm saddened by this.   Because I couldn't give anything away this time around, I'll do something new later. I still want to have fun with this. There's nothing I love more than giving away pizza, especially when someone puts at least a LITTLE effort into earning it. I'm not asking for anyone to spend money. Creativity is free and art is everywhere. I wasn't expecting Picasso's or Coen's. I just wanted SOMETHING. *sigh*... On to the next thing.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I give away pizza, I like to get the creative juices flowing. It's important to let yourself shine, regardless of skill levels. I've done creative contests and a Super Bowl contest, so I'm going for the best of both worlds!  I'm a Vikings fan from MN. You can probably guess how I felt watching Blair Walsh attempt that field goal... *sigh*  ANYWAY, I want to some how remind myself about it for the next couple of weeks, until Super Bowl Sunday. THAT'S WHAT THIS CONTEST IS FOR!  I'm looking for creativity and effort. There's a reason I'm posting this two weeks early. **What I'm looking for** is your interpretation of that fateful kick that ended the season for the Vikes. How, do you say? IT DOESN'T MATTER!!! *As long as it's legal!*  **RULES:**  Put in some effort towards something creative. FREE YOUR MIND! Show me the kick, in your own re-telling. This can be ANY art form, from poetry, painting, photography, filmmaking, sculpture, [macaroni art](http://southparkstudios.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/south-park/clip-thumbnails/season-3/0309/south-park-s03e09c05-macaroni-picture-of-the-last-supper-16x9.jpg?), etc... It just SOMEHOW **needs to relate to the kick.**   When creating your masterpiece, please make reference to your username & the date, visually. If your art is poetry, use something other than a computer to write it up, and post it by picture or scan. Real handwriting preferred. Feel free to PM me with any questions  or concerns and I'll be happy to clear them up.  **DEADLINE: SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, FEB 7, 2PM CST. US ONLY.**  The prize will be a GC to one of the big three, in a value of my choosing. I may even pick multiple winners, if I see fit. Good luck to you all! I can't wait to sob about the Vikings.  ^^^at ^^^least ^^^the ^^^Packers ^^^lost...  **EDIT:** [Video clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb_eXyhlHaA)  Thanks to /u/BurritoFurniture.	1454873751.0

I have just been offered one but will be poor for another month. I can survive, just. On rice and beans.  Its two for tuesday in the UK so its as cheap as it gets as far as pizza is concerned. To be honest i'd be happy with anything. I expect nothing but hey, worth a shot right?   I'll be giving back once my paycheck comes in :) this is a cute idea   EDIT: Pizza has been ordered for me! Will update once I get it (and possibly eaten it, no promises)  huge thank you to /u/mediaboy for his kindness. I will be passing this on next month when my paycheck is in.

I am slowly losing my faith in humanity. :/  I don't know how much more I can take of this soul crushing loneliness. I try, so hard it seems, but friendships never really seem to work out. I invite people to hang out and every time without fail they (the collective they, as in everyone I have tried with) cancel on me. I make friendly conversation with people when I take my daughter out of the house to do stuff, but it never leads anywhere. I am very chatty on Facebook, constantly commenting on friends posts and starting up private messages with them to see how things are and if they want to do anything, but nobody ever reciprocates. I join Facebook groups, mom websites, and attend gatherings where people bring kids and I guess I just never seem to click with anyone.  My pre-baby friends have little interest in me. The few friends I have made since her birth seem disinterested in maintaining anything. All my days are the same, filled with baby talk, bad toddler attitude, and mind numbing boredom. I am tired of being rejected by being ignored and cancelled on. I'm tired of literally having zero real friends. Tired of never having any adult conversation. Tired of being on the verge of tears every time I lay down to sleep.   People have my number. I call them and it always goes to voicemail. I text and get no replies. My phone NEVER rings. Nobody is ever first to message me. I literally leave my phone on silent all day just in case I get a text or call when my girl is napping, but that's kind of a joke cuz I never do. I am 28 and my mother is currently my only friend. I talk to her 2-3 times a week. And even she is too busy to hang out with me more than a couple times a month.   I was doing so well with not self-harming. I stopped for so long after I got pregnant, thinking that my life would get better and I had to be better for my little girl. I keep wanting to believe this, but my reality keeps showing me that nothing will get better. It only gets worse. I don't want my daughter to grow up and see I have no friends and nobody seems to like me. What kind of message does that send? My husband sees this too. I tell him of plans I have to hang out with so and so, and he gets excited because he knows how much I need social interaction. Then plans get cancelled on me again and his heart breaks almost as much as mine because he knows everyone does this to me. I swear he is the only non-blood relative that actually likes being around me and wants to spend time with me and talk to me.   Constantly being rejected just makes me hate people even more. It makes it that much harder to put myself out there because I know it will never lead anywhere. I know cutting isn't a solution, but it sure is a nice little distraction that reminds me I really am alive and there are experiences that aren't numbness. I just don't understand how and why my life ended up this way. I had so many friends in high school and college and none of those people like me anymore. Or even care about me in any way. I have tried so hard to maintain a few specific friendships that I seriously thought would be forever friendships. But I guess not. I don't understand why people are constantly cancelling on me, as if they regret making the plans in the first place. I don't know what it is about me that leads to all this. Do I smell bad? Am I that ugly? That boring? Are my conversations so uninteresting? I can't see the reason. I can't understand it. These rejections cause me so much emotional pain and I can't see the reason. I'm so fucking depressed. I'm just so damn lonely. Life shouldn't be this damn lonely with so many billions of people on the planet. Its just not right.  So like I said... Pizza won't fix this but it would definitely put a smile on my face at least for a few days.	1453085053.0

t3_3yljlz	1451353420.0	fieldnigga	shroom	[Request] Just a few more days	Til I get paid, this weekend. I am a first generation college student, attending via the graces of financial aid, loans, grants and scholarships. Fortunate that I have those things, because my parents are/were meth cooks and are spending the next few decades in jail (dark, I'm sorry! I promise I have a point). Unfortunately, this means I have no financial support outside of that. I have been working all break, including christmas eve and the day after trying to make rent (all that aid and stuff specifically does not cover the break periods and my winter break period is over a month long) and food. I didn't get to celebrate christmas this year, but honestly I don't get to celebrate it most years so that's fine. What's more upsetting is that I also didn't get even a hint of christmas dinner, which is by far my favorite part of the whole thing.   And now I'm sitting here in the group house while all of my housemates are with their respective families, enjoying their holiday. I don't want to hate them a little for it, but I work in the mail room on campus and I've had to spend all break processing christmas presents the likes I've never dreamed of and I'm really hungry and Friday seems so far away. I can't help but feel jealous. I have two bowls of ramen left but that's it. It would mean a lot to my stomach and mean a lot to me if someone were to nab me a thin crust pepperoni pizza. Which is my favorite and coincidentally the type of pizza that my Dad used to spell out "It's a Boy!" when he got word that my mom was pregnant with me. She cried. I ate the pizza vicariously, evidently. And now I'd like to eat some for real. Perhaps that which comforted my mother can now comfort me.   Some people, from what I can tell looking over the posts here, elect to do some trick or another for entertainment/payment for said pizza. I can't imagine what I could offer in that regard, but if someone has something specific they'd like to request that I might be able to do, let me know and I'll give it a shot. I practice my hand at writing/poetry now and again if that helps.  Sorry for being gloomy, guys! It's actually been a nice break in light of the frantic nature of finals so I don't meant to give the impression I'm sitting here in the dark in abject misery, sobbing myself to sleep. In all honesty, my job isn't that hard and during my off time I'm playing video games and reading comic books. So there's positive things going on, for sure. In fact, to continue being honest, the thing that drove me to make this post began with me saving my ramen for later instead of making some this evening (rations, motherfucker), but discovering after that I was unable to concentrate on the game because my stomach feels like its eating itself. I will be fine, not the first time in college I've gone hungry and not the first time in life - but goddammit I want to enjoy this break, haha!  Anyway, even if nobody responds, I genuinely hope you all had a good christmas and wish you a happy new year. To all of you students, make the break count if you can!

While we both get the day off work, we don't have money for a dinner date until I get paid tomorrow.	Like the title says, it's been a great 5 years together, but 1st of the month bills are always killer. We're not out of food, but a pizza to share would be better than tuna helper for dinner.   I'd love to surprise him with a pizza picnic. He's not expecting anything until my next day off (Tuesday.)     I can pay it forward of course, after my pay day hits, with my Christmas bonus!   I live in Texas, and our closest pizza chain is Domino's. Everything else is 20 miles away. (WTF)  Edit: I forgot to tag this post as [Request]  I can take it down and post a new thread if the mods would like. 	1450375240.0

[Seriously this is my desktop immediately prior to posting this.](http://i.imgur.com/jHMURmJ.jpg)  ~~So really I only need like $5 to get that one extra point to get a free pizza...

I appreciate the upvotes and all. **  Hey there, this years been a bit of a crazy one - job, no job, new job then injury.. safe to say my lack of planning or steady income has been a bit of a bummer. I tore my Achilles about 3 weeks ago now. Funnily fell on the last day of training for my new gig. I'm down to my last 50 dollars until I can get back to work (3-4weeks) and I still need to try and get some Christmas presents for the family. I don't have any  food here, or the extra money to order delivery. My car is in the shop and the nearest bus stop is a mile - and on crutches that seems like a marathon. You would really be helping me out with a pie today! I want to be able to pass the gesture on as well. Being unable to do a lot lately has changed my perspective on a lot of things.. The biggest one is being grateful for the little things.   Sorry for the ramble, it's been a long few weeks post-op.   I live in Austin, Tx if that helps.   Thanks for reading. 	1449879110.0

t3_3t1u3p	1447699074.0	EFCFrost	shroom	[Request] Halifax Nova Scotia - It's been a rough couple months for my son. Some feel good pie might be in order	Hi guys,  I know sob stories aren't fun so I'll try to keep this short.  I've been doing the single dad gig full time since September now after my little guy was taken from his Mom by CPS.   She has some serious issues to work out and I'm happy to have my son full time but he really misses her. These days he gets phone calls from her and aside from that she has supervised visits twice per month.  At first I figured it wasn't affecting him too much as he seemed happy as a clam (I realise now that might just be a delayed reaction because of his autism). Last night though he woke me up in the middle of the night and crawled into my bed crying because he missed his Mommy. I've never seen this behavior from him before. Seeing my son hurting is new to me and I'm trying not to tear up just thinking about it.  There's not too much I can do for him right now because of the way the custody is set up and I'd rather not go see his Mom anyways because of the situation she had my son living in. But at the same time I need something to make his day better.  He really likes pepperoni pizza and garlic bread from places like Pizza Pizza but I have no cash until Friday.  If someone would be willing to help make my son feel a little better I'd be very appreciative.  I'll post a photo of him enjoying his pizza in the comments section if we get pizza'd.  Thanks very much guys.   UPDATE: /u/MagzieM has pizza'd us. Thanks very much!  UPDATE 2: Does anyone know how to tag this darned thing so I can put thank you in the tag?	1447725381.0

Hello! I apologize in advance if I violate a rule I somehow managed to miss.  As the title says, I'm not broke, but I live paycheck to paycheck and money is rather tight right now. I live in a major city in Michigan, so most places are an option and within walking distance. If you need any other details, I'll happily provide them. Thank you for considering!	1445205648.0

Columbia, SC(29210) Mom of three here. Due to the flooding in Columbia, my husband missed a week of work. Rent and insurance ate up most of our funds. We were not prepared for this. I plan my grocery list knowing that my two oldest kids eat breakfast and lunch at school 5 days a week. They've been out of school since the flooding began, and our pantry and fridge is almost completely wiped out. My husband gets paid Friday. Our two oldest kids go back to school tomorrow, on a two hour delay.   http://imgur.com/a/MFxTE   Bonus pictures from my twins' 6th birthday, and us at Riverbanks zoo.	1444758003.0

t3_3o8g3f	1444495574.0	jason-funk	shroom	Perfect storm of bills, flu and a dead phone leaves me with a ramen diet this week. Maybe the pizza fairy could visit me?	Hey there, RAoP. My name is Jason and I'm from Ypsilanti, MI. This weekend, I hit the perfect storm of B.S. Seasonal flu kept me out of work 3 days last week, and my ridiculous copay drained my money.   Past that, getting my bricked phone swapped, paying utilities, rent, etc yesterday drained most of my check, leaving me $15 until next Friday. Exactly enough for gas if I really only drive to & from work.   To avoid my diet for the week being the half bag of tater tots and 3 packs of ramen I have, I was really hoping someone could hook me up with some pizza so I have something to spread out for a few days, and I'll pay it forward as soon as I can.   In advance, should anyone be so kind, thank you. Even if not, thanks for reading. Even being semi-complainy made me feel a little better.  EDIT: huge thanks to /u/clairysaur for being so generous! 	1444515699.0
t3_3o09y9	1444331209.0	RuncibleSpoon18	pizza	[Offer] Post your hobby and what you love about it and I'll pick the one I find most interesting	I've been super into fpv racing since the beginning of the summer and have been having fun making some [shitty YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/fa9tjX3594I) of me and my friend flying.  Before the summer I hadn't even heard of this before but now I can't get enough of it.  This made me realize that people are probably into some weird or uncommon hobbies I don't know about.  Tell me about your hobby (pictures or video encouraged) and why you love it and I'll choose someone (most likely someone who has given pizza before) to win a gift card to any pizza place I can get a gift card for online.  I'll be checking over the next few hours and will choose later this evening  Thanks for sharing,  everyone! The pizza is going to /u/heyitsjay and his dope Gundam models. You are all cool people and I wish I could buy one for everyone. 	1444348631.0

t3_3nh7w5	1443983263.0	feiticeirarose	shroom	[Request] all bills paid, but nothing left for groceries. Would love a pizza to nibble on til I can go to food bank on Tuesday.	-CLOSED-  Just like the title says, I got paid, but everything went to rent, student loans and the stupid electric bill; which for the month of September and August were both over 200 because I live in Texas. Thankfully it's cooling down which means I can turn off the A/C!  Food bank opens in Tuesday morning, but until then all I have left is a few cups of rice. I already asked my folks for some help and they said "they'd think about it".

t3_3lwwe4	1442910202.0	nips84	shroom	[Request][Colorado USA] Nice warm cheesy pizza please	So let me just start by saying that I had my identity stolen at the beginning of this year, went through this whole process of getting my taxes to me. IRS has told me 3 different dates since this process has started.   I lost my job earlier this month, and was expecting my return to be here 3 days ago. The return is enough to pay rent, my bills, and get some food in here while I continue my job search.  On top of the impending doom that I have situated directly in front of myself, the microwave that this apartment complex gave me does not work. I have been eating oatmeal soaked in warm water with some sugar. I would like something nice and warm to eat while it is getting nippy outside. Any givers out there today?

So instead of being at a job interview I am now in my dorm with no plans tonight and a pizza would amp my night up a little bit, I'll even share with the roommates.

t3_3kbkhs	1441843277.0	Aarondhp24	pizza	Broke at truck driving school in East TN. Today was weird, and I'd love a pizza. Will play music for food, and telling a story in the meantime.	To preface I'll give a bit of history on how I ended up here. I moved back home from California after being stuck there for 6 years. Stuck, how?" You might be wondering.  Well while I was in the military there, I picked up a felony charge. That charge is no longer on my record at all. You can check out my submission history to do some light reading on *that* situation.  I made the decision to come back home shortly afterwards, and got to Tennessee back in April. Work was sporadic. I worked at a pizza shop with my eldest younger brother, as a server. That job fell through pretty quick. The entire staff was teenagers fresh out of highschool, and I come from a fine dining background. 2/10 would not recommend.  So i go to work for a research group investigating timeshare fraud. They were paying part time minimum wage, and I had a deal secured for nearly $25K. At 15% commission, I was going to be set for the months I was behind on bills. Well, my boss man let that deal fall through the cracks and I started getting repot notices from my bank. I borrowed over $1,000 collectively from my parents to hang onto my car and insurance (this was 3 months of bills stacked up).  I've been a /r/vandweller for some time and I really liked the idea of trucking. Saw an add for paid truck driver school with a $200 food stipend. I did my math, and if I left that week I could make it to the company training phase and make $300/wk, then $500/wk minimum for my first 60 days on the road.   I jumped. Big mistake. The stipend was $50/wk for two weeks and then $100 when I graduated. Suffice to say, if you mess up any test or miss any deadlines, you're here longer than the 3 weeks it's supposed to last, and you're just going hungry **or in debt to the school for $6,000.**  Nice little scam they got going here. So now that I'm signed into a contract out of desperation, I've found out what a shit hole this school is. I'm going to go ahead and post this and update with the rest of the story from today:  So I'm attending this joke of a school. Instructors don't instruct. One in particular likes to yell at us like we're not paying them $300 a day for this course. Absolutely unprofessional environment to be obtaining a federally regulated CDL. They gave us a study guide that was created by a woman who has never driven a truck or gotten her CDL before. Saying things like "a gap of 1/4" between the brake lining and the drum" or calling a torsion bar a torque bar. The air brake test was written improperly and if you miss ONE thing on it at the exam, you fail. As you can imagine, most of the students have complained to the recruiting company that sent us here. We've been misled at pretty much every step of this process, and the guys that struggle? They won't pass this course. One girl has been here Mon-Sat 8:00-6:00 for 5 weeks. This is a 3 week course, and I can do every maneuver in my second week. She can't do a single one, and half the time the instructors are up at the rest area on their phones!  Get this: students are banned from teaching other students. Gee, wonder why. I brought a truck sim I got on steam to explain some stuff to the guys having a hard time, and I was told to put it up and play with myself for 7 hours out of the day while we waited to get on the trucks. What a joke.   On to my WEIRD day. So I'm going up to take a potty break during our morning pre trip inspection, and the worst instructor we have, we'll call him Douchebag, pulls me to the side at the door away from everyone. He then proceeds to threaten me, telling me if we weren't at the school he'd beat my ass. I'm 28 years old, paying $300 a day to this school, and he's threatening me for **complaints made by multiple students.**  It was a moment that /r/PublicFreakout would have loved. I managed to get my phone out as his boss was pulling up and his tune changed quick. So I'm thinking "Ok, this guy is about to lose his job." Lol, no. That would be the rational thing to have happen. We wait for the schools admin to get there and sit down with her, douchebags boss, and another instructor that was nearby and witnessed some of it. They suggest that I don't know what a threat looks or sounds like. They try to throw words like "roughhousing" around. One of them tried to accuse me of being aggressive, to which I aggressively retorted "what part of me telling him I'm not gonna fight back, I'm just going to call the police" over and over seemed aggressive while I'm being actively threatened. I'm told this is the nicest person the admin has ever known, and that was about the point I just cut the conversation off. I told them i was calling the sheriff and the recruiting center and tomorrow I'm contacting the actual trucking company to flesh out this nightmare employment process.  If I wasn't on the hook for $6K, I would have walked away already. This is crazy town during a free meth event.   So I talked to the Sheriff, filed a report, douchebag left the school of his own volition before she got there (smart move on his part) , I got to play the good guy telling them "No I don't want him fired because you're already dangerously understaffed. Just keep him away from me." Now I'm sitting on my hotel room with no cell reception, and the internets jumping in and out  so I can't skype call my Mom, and I really really want to :(  That was my day. I have a guitar, and I'm learning "Can't help falling in love" so I figure I would do a video tribute or maybe try to learn an easy song for someone who was interested in getting me some hot delicious pepperoni pizza. Thanks much, and if you made it this far, you deserve a medal for endurance. Thanks for reading.	1441844330.0

I apologize if my title comes off as a bit harsh (now that I read it, I don't like how I worded it). It's just that I "won" a pizza a few weeks ago, but OP never actually sent the gift card. I'm not quite sure what happened with OP (I hope he got everything sorted out). I told my family we were getting pizza for dinner and I never delivered. I felt like mom of the year.   My husband has worked an incredibly tough day and he will be coming home to whatever I can scrape together for dinner as he doesn't get paid until Saturday and this poor mother's cupboard is bare (pasta and pickles, anyone?). He had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (again) for lunch today and I think coming home to a pizza would really brighten his day.   I'm not trying to give you a sob story, simply the facts. Our family (husband, me, two kids, two cats) is just having a rough time and my SO could certainly use a treat tonight.   Take care and thank you for reading. :)   **Edit:** Deleted details of "sob story" and just left the facts. 	1441314162.0

t3_3j4xzz	1441056965.0	OneHighJedi	shroom	[Request] I lost all my money because someone decided to 'card' me	A few weeks ago, I went into the gas station just to get some gas and run out. I gave the guy my card, but didn't believe that I was the owner. Okay, weird, never had that happen to me before. So I run back to my car, without the card, and grabbed my ID. Guy rung me up for the gas, handed me my receipt, and that was that.   It didn't click in my head that I shouldn't have left the card with anyone, but this guy was an employee at a reputable gas station, BP, so I didn't really have that much concern about him trying to steal my information....  Come to find out, Saturday, when I got my statement, my account had been overdrafted for shit that I didn't buy. Couple bucks at Walmart, couple at a gas station (not the one he worked at), and here's the kicker, this dumbass decided to use the card to order take out.  So I called the Chinese restaurant and told them about my situation. They found the order that used my card number and gave me a address. So I called the cops and gave them the address and his REAL NAME that he used to make the order.  Come to find out, it's the dude from the gas station. I'm definitely going to be suing this guy since that's fucking identity theft and now I have to wait for the bank to clear everything up and get me my money back.   In the mean time, I can't buy anything and all I have on me is $3...I never liked keeping cash on me in case I lost my wallet or got robbed but damn, this bites.  I would love it if someone can help me out, even for just tonight..  EDIT: Big shoutout to /u/evtehbaus28 for the pie! Thanks for helping a stranger over the internet out. I will definitely be paying this forward.  	1441074890.0

t3_3hl6dg	1439994518.0	itsraymilz	shroom	[Offer] Giving a pizza to someone in need	Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/3hikla/offer_my_wedding_was_this_saturday_relationship/   I'm still waiting on the person who I chose for the first pizza to reply back, and during that time I went ahead and gave away another one.   Well, I want to give another pizza to another person in need. I'm also offering to purchase a pizza for two couples this Saturday, on what was to be my Wedding day. See the thread I linked to at the beginning of this post for more details on that.   Basically, I want to help out, and although I'm down and trying to pick myself up, I'm in a position where my money could be used to help someone out. Of course, I know it's not much, but it's one less meal that one of you (and this coming Saturday, four of you) won't have to worry about and that makes a world of difference to someone. I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by people that have lent me a hand in times of need and this is my way of paying it forward.   So, like I've said in my original post. Please be honest. If you're going through a tough time, don't lie about it, if you just want a pizza, then be honest about that as well.   I'll be choosing someone when I get off of work which will be at around 6PM Central Time today (8/19/2015). This will give plenty of time for users to come in (as opposed to yesterday where I basically only gave out a 2 hour windows, sorry about that :/ ) and get a chance at having a meal tonight  Please try and be prompt about replying to my PM once I've selected you.   Thanks to everyone  Edit: I've messaged the user who won yesterday's offer and let them know that if they don't reply by the time I get off work I'll also be giving that one away in this thread.   **Edit**: ~~The user that I chose on the thread yesterday has yet to respond, so I've decided to give that one away to another user in this one.~~ The user ended up PMing me, I'll keep my word and still give them the pizza and I'm also still giving the pizza to the other two users I chose from this topic. It wouldn't feel right to me if I didn't. Congratulations to [Xeropoint](https://www.reddit.com/user/Xeropoint) and [neonseahorse](https://www.reddit.com/user/neonseahorse). Hope you two enjoy the pizza and things start looking up in your life.  To the rest who didn't get a pizza, I'm sorry. Please don't be discouraged, know that I'm only one man doing this and I'm doing as much as I can with what money I have left over from saving to get me back up on my feet. I truly wish I could feed all of you tonight, but it's just not possible for me to do. Also, I see that a lot of you are going through some tough times, but please don't lose hope. The beautiful thing about hardships is that you can overcome them and if things come to worst, just keep in mind that you're very fortunate to be alive when a lot of other do not get that chance.    Thank you all so much for your kind words and for posting. As a reminder, I will be giving away two pizzas this Saturday, on what was to be my wedding day, to two couples, one pizza each, but I will be asking for some sort of verification (please refer to the previous post). I'm more than welcome to suggestions as to how to conduct that giveaway on Saturday.   Thank you everyone and again, please keep a positive outlook. Things will get better.**   EDIT: I seem to have ran into an issue with my bank and it's not letting any of my transactions go through. As of writing this it's currently 9PM, so I can't contact customer support. I'll be getting in touch with my bank as early as I can tomorrow. I apologize for the inconvenience.   EDIT: I'm SO SO sorry. In a nutshell, it wasn't my bank that canceled it but Dominos. I've gone ahead and email them and they asked me to email their gift card support and this was their response.  http://imgur.com/OLFqT5k  http://imgur.com/VfCe0hv  http://imgur.com/EnnIFjo	1440127209.0

t3_3hikla	1439941998.0	itsraymilz	shroom	[Offer] My wedding was this Saturday. Relationship ended. Want to help someone out.	Giving away another pizza today: https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/3hl6dg/offer_giving_a_pizza_to_someone_in_need/    Long story short:    Two years ago I flew across the ocean to meet what was the love of my life. I left my house, my job, my car, my friends and family for her.  I had proposed last year in December and set the date for August 22nd this year. Everything was paid off.  I was disrespected and treated very poorly every day. It was killing me inside. I broke it off. I was kicked out of the apartment and reached out to co-workers and almost all of them offered to house me until I get back up on my feet and find a place to stay and a car, as all I have here is a military duffle bag filled with my clothes, a flag from my home (Puerto Rico) and a PC I had built to work at home on the weekends (I'm an IT Engineer). I'm... more than thankful for my co-workers, who I've known only for a few months. Without them, I'd be out in the streets and would've lost my job.  So, I'm in a pretty dark place right now, Reddit. No friends (only had one back at home) or family, but enough about my shitty current state.   I want to make someone happy, I want to help out someone in need, which is why I've decided to to gift one of you a pizza. You don't have to tell me your life story, but if you do, please be honest. If you want a pizza just because, then say so. If you're going through some really tough times, then say so. I don't know how I'll chose who gets it, but I'll be checking my my phone periodically. I want to make sure that whoever gets it, gets it tonight.    Additionally, on what was to be my wedding day, this August the 22nd, I'll be gifting two couples a pizza. One for each couple. I will be asking for proof, a picture of the couple, or something, holding a time stamp (and please tell me if this is against the rules of this subforum. I might have overlooked. I apologize if I did)  Also, this is my first time doing this, so any help as to how I would go about it would be appreciated.   If it helps any, I'm in the U.S., living in Alabama at the moment.  EDIT: I'll be picking the person who gets the pizza at around 9PM (I believe Central Time?)This will hopefully give people enough time to post and just about enough time for whoever gets it to eat and get some early sleep. I don't want to keep whoever I give it to up late waiting for a pizza.  EDIT: I messaged the person who I decided to give the pizza to and they haven't responded back. During that time I gave another pizza away. I'm going to give another one today (8/19/2015). I will be choosing a person at 6PM Central Time (time I get out of work). Postings will be done in a separate thread. 	1439994586.0

Now i'm not sure if you ever had to deal with student finance but the money they give does not cover the holidays especially with rent and things.  After spending a couple of hours on the dominos wondershot with the hopes of free pizza, the deals there are the exact same as the normal deals. Then like an RKO out of nowhere, i hear about this wonderful place. A mystical place where pizza can happen, believe me i don't want to ask but can you help me reddit? You're my only hope.  So why should you give me a jobless student this magical act of kindness? Well i have very limited ability with paint, (by limited i mean i've used it once about ten years ago). So if you'd like the most pathetic paint drawing in the history of mankind i can exchange this, otherwise i am open to suggestions. I can also issue a sincere promise that once money has found it's way back into my life, i can help pass this miraculous gift onto others. So if you find me worthy i will be forever in your debt. 	1439157690.0
t3_3garyi	1439080524.0	TheAnneThorne	shroom	[Request] Moved to a new city alone and haven't started work yet. Would love a pizza pick-me-up!	Edit! Order filled. Thanks to aweeks007!   I moved to St Louis 2 days ago from NC. I set up a job and a place to live but spent all of my money on bus fare and unexpected expenses to take care of my kitten (she has worms). I don't have a fridge at my new place yet and wasn't able to bring food with me on my trip because of baggage restrictions and don't have any friends here I could ask.  I could really really use a pizza. I feel so isolated and hopeless in this city and I'm sure things will be fine when I start working and meet people but right now I need a pick me up and a bite to eat.  Thanks for reading!	1439084230.0

t3_3fwdsw	1438796041.0	DearDeanna4	shroom	[Request][MD,US] Broke on medical leave D:	I've spent all morning at the doctors getting my only functioning hand treated for second degree burns (the other is healing from carpal tunnel surgery). I made Ramen this morning and managed to spill hot boiling water all over my hand and arm. I am now left with two hands that can be used very minimally. I'm broke, I have no food and I'm having a really, really, crap month.  A nice, hot, cheese pizza and a nap sounds like heaven at the moment.  All I can offer in return is to pay it forward one day when I'm capable and/or my friendship. I don't mean the kind where we talk once and part ways. I mean the forever kind. Even if you don't get me a pizza, we can still be friends. Just message me. <3  Thank you for reading and having a beautiful day, lovely.   Edit: Forgot to mention, I'm willing to show any proof you need. Of my hands (it isn't just a random sob story..), ID, my bank account, my pantry, whatever you need. ^-^ 	1438796296.0

t3_3fjx8d	1438554324.0	Fathomlol	shroom	[Request] Got offered pizza, got sniped by similar name scammer, super upset	A few days ago, I posted about how my job has been lowering my hours to train some newbies before school starts back up in my town. (Big college town) A very nice person offered me a pizza, and some scumbag made a name very similar to mine and "stole" the charity from said user. I am so low on funds/food that I actually cried over this pizza. I hate to be a sob like this, but I feel like this shouldn't be done to anyone, let alone someone with a can of ravioli to last for the next 5 days. Someone helping me out would be much appreciated, and I will guarantee that I will re-RAOP when I get my school money so I am financially stable again.

t3_3fbybn	1438373620.0	Fathomlol	shroom	[request] Typical broke college kid, really struggling	My story is pretty simple. College kid at an expensive D1 school. I was locked into the lease for longer than I thought and decided to stay in town over the summer... That causes two problems,1.) I really miss my family and 2.) I have had to pay bills that I wasn't anticipating.  This is bad, but I was confident I can do it. I have a decent job, and was working 30-40 hours a week, thus making rent and still having a sufficient amount of money to grocery shop.(still with spaghetti-o's and ramen, but living)  This month has become hell however, my workplace has started training new people for the back to school rush. This has caused me an immense amount of financial squeeze on me. I have made my rent, but have only been able to spend about $20 on groceries in the past 3 1/2 weeks. All this being said, I would really appreciate a random act of pizza, as it would not only fill my stomach but restore my broken morale. This is my first post on this sub and I think I covered everything as well as managed to obey the rules. I love that this sub exists and hope to be able to re-give once I gain the financial ability!  Edit: ATM this request is still open. I'll edit again and make a thank you post if this gets fulfilled!  Edit2: MY PIZZA FAIRY GOT SNIPED BY SOME SCAMMER WHO MADE A NAME CLOSE TO MINE!!!!!

We have a 10 month old and money is extra tight until we get paid on Saturday.	My mil called me on the 4th of July to let us know our family plans were cancelled because her boyfriend was being violent. I could hear him screaming at her in the background. He has a history of violence so I told her to pack an emergency bag and come stay with our family. Her son was supposed to visit her for the summer, but after she left, she was sad that she would not be able to see him. We opened our small  1 bedroom apartment for him to visit. Money has been spread thin since there are 5 mouths to feed and my husband is the sole provider. He doesnt get paid until Saturday and I dont get my tuition reimbursement until Wednesday.

t3_3diyje	1437067573.0	Simondo88	PIF	[REQUEST] [UK] Please could someone spare some hot food? Thanks.	Hey! So I've been off work for many months now after I was in a hit and run case. I've just been told I'm healthy enough to return to work, which is awesome. Only problem now is I have to find a new job since I was let go from mine! I've been living off bread for 4 days now. I'm only due to get £10 on Monday from my Employment and Support Allowance since I'm now in transition into Jobseekers Allowance. It'll be 3 weeks before I see any real money. Apparently the government have stopped doing crisis loans to people in need and my only option is the local food bank. But here is the kicker. Despite being fully independent, because I live in my mothers house (she's never here, she is a live in carer), I don't qualify for food tokens. I'm kinda hoping there is a kind soul out there who could send me some cheesy calories. Thanks!  I can't believe how quick this happened, but a massive thank you to /u/meehan117 for being so generous and quick.	1437075453.0

She has 4 days left in escrow and the buyer is dicking her around requesting all this last minute shit to be done. They think he may end up backing out. All the stuff left last Wednesday for Washington so her hubby and her have near nothing in the house (a few cups, an air mattress and their pets basically).  We have plans to hang out and get drunk one last time together tomorrow and what would be more awesome than to share a pizza w/ them?  EDIT: Oops, the subject should say CA not CAN.

My roommates came to me to tell me that neither one of them could fully cover rent and I would have to pay most of it myself. That took the last of my money and I don't get paid again until this Saturday. My roomies get paid Friday and Monday. None of us have any extra income until then.  I hate to ask but it would just be really great for something good to happen.   Edit: I do have some groceries but split three ways this stuff isn't going to last us longer than tomorrow. Just thought I should add that.	1436221194.0

t3_39z2qm	1434410233.0	DeusExMachinaX	shroom	[Request] Fiance is sick, we own a dog grooming salon in ft worth TX. Anyone interested in a trade?	So my fiance and I own a dog grooming salon in Ft Worth TX, since he's sick and payday isn't until next week, would anyone be interested in trading a pizza for a clean pup? Included in our bath package is bath, nails, glands, ears cleaned and a nice brush out.   More than happy to recieve a free pizza from one dog lover to another, or from anyone that understands the tribulations of being a small business owner. We just thought offering a free professional dog bath in exchange for kindness would come off as...less moochy.  We are proud hard workers but sometimes it's difficult to make ends meet. Though we usually tough it out, I hate seeing my fiance so sick with only ramen to eat.  I  wasn't sure if offering a trade up would be allowed on this sub, but I figured it would be worth a shot. Thank you very much.  Edit: Thank you so much captain hoit! We will be sure to pass on the kindness to a needy family with puppies. We work with the charity organization,  Don't Forget to Feed Me, which runs a pet food pantry. I will be sure to get a hold of them tomorrow and have them gather a few needy pet family's.	1434421121.0

Thanks everyone - I hope lots of people post their consolation prize codes if they don't plan to use them so that we can all be eating pizza.	1433974160.0
t3_39c34h	1433964600.0	explos1onshurt	shroom	[REQUEST] A pie. I need it most.	I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.   I lost my job, unemployment hasn't come in and I haven't eaten in 3 weeks. I have been able to survive off of cups of water and barbecue packets from McDonald's, which I split the lion's share of amongst my 4 children and 2 dogs. I suspect they may ban me soon.  My house burned down, and my wife left me after taking everything of value. We currently keep warm by burning pieces of my house that haven't been completely reduced to dust. This wouldn't be too bad, if it were not for the fact that my house was broken into prior to my wife leaving and my house facing divine retribution. Maybe that was the final straw for her.  Please, a pizza would really take our minds off the body cancer we all have, and the dire situation we are in. Thank you for your time.  /s	1433965253.0

t3_3731qz	1432469138.0	loqi0238	pizza	[Offer] Life is wonderful, and pizza is too.	Hey pizza comrades, how are you all today?  I will be getting myself some 'za later, and wanted to send someone an e gift card just for the hell of it. Why not, right?  The winner will be picked at random, but to be considered you must post either: a haiku about *any*thing, OR, post all the chores and responsibilities you have to deal with today.   It's not a contest, so don't worry about quality/quantity, just choose one or the other.  I will be taking a break from yard work at 12:30pm (EST), and it is just after 8am (EST) right now, so you've all got 4 1/2 hours to enter.  The prize is a $20 e gift card from either Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns.   Good luck, and have a great day!  -edit-  I took a short break from my yard work to see how things were going, but I've got to get back to it. In about 2 more hours a winner will be chosen. Good luck everyone!  -edit 2-  I just ordered my pizza: Dominos handmade pan with extra cheese, sliced Italian sausage, and mushrooms, a stuffed spinach and feta cheesy bread with garlic sauce for dipping, and a chicken parm sandwich. Yeah, I'm hungry after several hours of yard work (and maybe a couple beers...), and about 6 hours of laundry, studying, and cleaning the upstairs of the house in some random order.   Anyways. I'll be randomly choosing a winner in 15 minutes, so there's still time to post something!  -edit 3-  Man, there were quite a few posts! Thanks to all those who posted something, and a winner will be chosen at random (space monkeys from outer space will use high-tech sub-mathematical calculations to land on a random post) within the next few moments.  -edit-  The winner has been selected and PM'd! Thanks to all those who posted :)	1432485806.0

t3_3527nr	1430921865.0	coolguycraig	PIF	[Request] Very hungry - willing to lend out $50 to a Kiva member in need for $25 in Domino's	Hey guys. Several months ago I gave this a shot, and it worked out really well. I got pizza and someone on Kiva got $50. I tried it again two months after, and another generous Redditor contributed for me to lend out another $50. Much thanks to /u/PizzusChrist and the other user (who has since deleted their username).  If you don't know what Kiva is, check it out. Here's a link to my lender profile: http://www.kiva.org/lender/css (I added a section saying hi to Reddit as verification)  I've lent a bit over $1200 on Kiva so far. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio: http://puu.sh/eTv1R/a6a2c09604.png  I'm down to lend double the amount that anyone is willing to put my way in the form of a Domino's gift card. I've got a little over $50 in my Kiva account, so an amount of $25 or below would be ideal (but I'm not complaining if you offer more).  You can pick who I'll lend to: http://www.kiva.org/lend - I'll reply back with proof of the loan, and you'll see them appear in my user profile. I'll post it all here so everything is legit.  Thanks to anyone who gives this consideration.	1430922136.0

t3_34v81u	1430773273.0	Gigantic_Brain	pizza	[Request] Just moved back to college town and am exhausted from moving/restocking everything.	Hi all, this seems super interesting! I just moved back to my college town for the summer before moving to Germany for a year in the fall. I just feel pretty burned out from packing/unpacking and restocking all the things that I couldn't take with me.  My girlfriend and I split amicably yesterday due to my travel plans in the interest of remaining friends so I'm not depressed but that also happened!  There's an added level of irony in that my new roommate is a delivery driver.  I moved back from Detroit and while there's a great group of independent places there, I've been longing for some Papa John's for a while (if allowed to make requests).  I think I did the request right but please let me know if I didn't! Thanks!  TL;DR - Exhausted from very recent major life changes and would love some Papa John's!  Edit: I also just cut myself with a kitchen knife preparing a snack lol	1430776846.0
t3_34ul0h	1430763029.0	EFCFrost	shroom	[Request] Girlfriend just broke up with me and completely caught me off guard. Not in the mood for cooking.	Greenwood NS, Canada  Hey guys. I'll keep this one short. 2015 Has not been the most servicable year for me. In January my marriage ended, I've been only seeing my son on weekends and needless to say it's not been fun.  The silver lining of this year was a beautiful, dependable, loving girlfriend with whom I had terrific dates, wonderful memories and great sex. She really was the whole package.   Well out of nowhere today she decided to break up with me because "our lives are going in two different directions." To say it caught me completely off guard is the understatement of the year.  I'm not feeling the greatest right now. My ex-wife is letting my son visit tonight but I don't know if I'll be in the best mood to cook anything good.  Could use some pizza.  Thanks in advance guys  Edit - Wow 44 upvotes. Even though I haven't been pizza'd I really appreciate the support from all of you. Thank you guys!	1430871521.0

Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor!  -edit-  The contest is still open! Life and work prevented me from completing it yesterday, so I will be going through submissions, even those after the initially stated time-frame, and choosing a winner soon.

t3_335t3r	1429476261.0	BisFitty	shroom	[Request] Broke and depressed.	No sob story, just being real. I've been pretty depressed lately, idk if it's the gloomy weather, money issues, or just random, untriggered depression, all I know is, I feel like crap. Im hoping some comfort food can help snap me out of my funk, so here I am, at RAOP. All of the major chains are fairly close to me, but if it would be at all possible, it would be SUPER awesome if a Pizza-er would send the money via paypal so I can transfer it to my Google wallet and then get a pie from mine and my wife's favorite local place, [Carmine's Pie House](http://carminespiehouse.com/)  Im not being picky by any means, I would even be grateful for a Little Caesar's Hot N Ready, I just want some of that salty, cheesy, greasy comfort that only a nice hot pizza pie can provide.  Whether or not anyone can help me out, thanks to anyone who reads this.     **Edit:** It has been brought to my attention that it would probably be easier for someone to simply call Carmine's and place the order than for me to do the convoluted plan I had come up with, so that is an option as well :)  Thanks	1429478914.0

[Boyfriend](http://imgur.com/a/qvS7d) just got a new temp job doing IT at a local hospital, and three weeks later came down with a terrible infection (which turned out to be MRSA) in a very [*delicate* place](http://imgur.com/a/L9ohJ)(SFW). After his fever hit 104 we headed to the ER, and didn't make it home till a week later.  I spent the whole week eating his leftover [hospital food](http://i.imgur.com/Ym6Z1eM.jpg), and stuff from their admittedly decent vending machine. A nice hot pizza would really hit the spot for both of us right now.  Edit: Thank you /u/aefd4407 for your generous offer, this [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/Uz96q5k.jpg) is delicious! 	1428294816.0

t3_31g99g	1428178538.0	maragesic	shroom	[Request] Tired, hungry, and recovering from surgery	Hi RAOP,  I had my gallbladder removed Thursday evening. I stayed with a friend that night and last while getting through the worst of the pain. I'm back home now, but I'm not supposed to bend over or lift anything for a few weeks. My roommates are gone hiking, and between the lifting-ban and the almost narcolepsy from the pain meds, I really cannot conceive of being able to cook anything today. I don't have any money right now or else I wouldn't be throwing myself at the mercy of others. I'm in Austin, TX. My friend still has my car because I don't think it is safe for me (or anyone else, for that matter!) for me to drive while on pain medication. I would sincerely appreciate any assistance that could be granted. If nobody is able to help, I understand that too.   just to note: I've previously received a pizza from here over two years ago, way way back when this subreddit first started.

My wife and I split up in January and since then I've been pretty well putting every spare dollar I have to making sure she's adequately set up in her new life. Unfortunately this payday I seem to have dropped the ball and ran out of food in my fridge yesterday.  I don't get paid until tomorrow and quite frankly tomorrow's pay is not going to be fun either.  If possible I could really use some pizza to fill my hungry belly and put me in a good mood for bill day tomorrow. It also might help me feel a bit better about my upcoming divorce. We're still pretty freshly separated and to say it hurts is the understatement of the year. (We've been together since 2005)  Thanks to anyone who can help.  PS - I'm in a small town so the pizza options are limited to Greco's pizza, Pizza Delight and a terrific family owned place down the road called Mimie's Pizza.	1427719326.0

t3_30fdce	1427409004.0	JabberBody	shroom	[Request] Broke, unemployed recent grad fighting depression -- Trying again!	Hey.  I got pizza'd a couple years ago and I submitted a request a few weeks ago.  Someone responded, but there wasn't a Papa John's around me so he couldn't help.  Figured I'd try again.  I'm a recent university grad.  After graduation I found a job immediately and lived with my girlfriend in our own apartment.  I lost all of that in January, for various reasons out of my control, and I spent two months this year recovering from mono, making it impossible for me to find a new job.  Apparently I was living with mono for nearly two years and it was a relief to recover, but I lost everything I had and had to start again from scratch.  I've been back on the job search for the last month and I've been getting tons of interview opportunities, but now I'm broke and hungry.  I've been keeping occupied with various community projects and resume builders, but nothing's been paying yet.  I keep telling myself maybe this is the day I'll find a job.  Maybe tomorrow.    It's been a tough year and I'm trying to rise above it.  A little nutrition and kindness from a stranger would be a nice pick up.  It's not all gloomy.  I found myself a great living situation with some very cool people.  And I've got a few prospects on the horizon.  I'm just hungry :P  Thanks for reading my sob story anyway.  It helps just writing it all out.  This is an awesome community and I hope to contribute in the future.  Edit:  I forgot to mention, but I am literally out of food right now.  Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this.  I just have no idea how else to feed myself tonight.  Thanks.  Cheers!	1427423127.0

Went to work this morning, took a nap, and the person I was going to go to dinner with cancelled, and I can't find anyone else who wants to go with me.

Three days ago I posted a request, and /u/whynotdrew rose to the occasion.   Thank you.   Unfortunately due to things beyond both of our control I never got the gift card and never got the pizza.   While my original post was about proving to my roommate RAOP works, and breaking up the monotony of mac 'n' cheese, only the later has happened as I've sustained myself on Cheerios and random gleanings from the roommate's stash of ramen.   For that reason, I'd like to ask for one more shot at this. As with my last post my giver will have a thank you note featuring their username as my Twitter profile pic for a week, and I will Pizza-it-forward twice when I can.  Thank you all.	1426711995.0

t3_2yr0oh	1426126260.0	bellonart	shroom	[Request] He just left... drown my sorrows with cheese and red sauce... (I'm actually hungry)	So, long story short... my BF of 9 years just got into a car with another (much younger) boy and they drove off together. Tomorrow he is flying to Europe to meet ANOTHER boy... he's been busy. Anyway, the details aren't important... I'm an emotional WRECK. The worst part is that I haven't been able to work for the last 2 weeks because I have a very stressful job and I had to take a leave of absence to deal with all these issues I've been having with my BF. So, I have no money for the next 2 weeks... (yeah, he left me with no money too)...  A pizza would be extremely comforting to have right now if I could afford it. Thanks.  **UPDATE** My work just called me, they denied my leave of absence... I just got fired. Lovely.	1426129239.0

If anyone can still help, I'll regift the other Pizza gift cert to you/whoever u want if it ever shows up. Also I might have a Steam game or two to trade. I haven't used it much but my little brother has gotten me into buying a bunch of stuff I never play during the sales.**   Hey guys, I mostly use reddit to complain about movies, so I shouldn't have too much info that can personally identify me. I work as a sub teacher so my cashflow is pretty non existent as it is. Lately I've had to pay $1000 out of pocket for new special contact lenses. I have a cornea problem called keratoconus that kinda stinks. Also, my parents are pretty young but have had a real run of bad luck. My dad screwed up his back, his surgeon screwed it up worse (fused the wrong vertebrae!) and he ended up losing his job.   Anyway I'm penniless for probably another month. Still trying to catch up from all the days off in winter...now we're getting snow days!  :(   Plus I'm getting an infected tooth pulled tomorrow, as I didn't have insurance til last year and uninsured dental work is insane. So I'm on amoxicillin and need to get crap in my stomach. Been rationing out the last of my pantry. Finished off my last box of brown rice the other day and ate a can of cranberry sauce for dinner last night.    This is all true. Please laugh at me. I'm not depressed or anything but holy crap am I hungry. I did get pizzad once over a year ago under several of the same circumstances and paid it forward. 	1425869955.0

t3_2xutpr	1425432311.0	batosuai	shroom	[Request] I won't have any food until Sunday	Hi Random Acts of Pizza, I've never been gifted a pizza before, but I guess I'll try again. I really don't have anything to lose by asking, anyway.  I'm a first-year college student who's currently between jobs. It's spring break at my school (FGCU, if you're interested in fact-checking me) which means that my meal plan is completely useless right now, as the dining hall is closed until Sunday, the 8th. I haven't had anything to eat since Sunday, and I'm ready to eat shoeleather at this point. If you, dear reddit, wouldn't mind helping a dumbass student who made a huge mistake a little less pained, I'd be much obliged(seriously, what possessed me to not check if the dining hall would be open during break?). I have nobody I can rely on, but regardless, I don't think I'll die if I don't get a pizza. Either way, thanks reddit. Edit: For grammar  Edit 2: PIZZA RECIEVED. =D	1425491440.0

t3_2x6ne2	1424915559.0	throwawaytonotthrow	shroom	[Request] Not a sob story, but an I've-almost-made-it-just-one-more-week story. First time requester-lady getting back on her feet.	Hi there! I never thought I'd be requesting help from my lovely fellow Redditors. I've had a rough last few years with leaving my partner and moving to a new state, realizing I couldn't get over my abusive relationship alone, and taking some time off (and all my savings) to really get myself in a good headspace -- which included going to a domestic violence rehabilitation center.  Long story short: work odd jobs and saved up to move to a new place, just got a nicer paying contract job, and then after a year of bouncing around, finally got an apartment of my own! This means I used all my resources and still haven't gotten gas/elec in my place yet (so I can't cook cheap food at my place), etc.  However! I get my first paycheck from this new gig early next week, and just had my first day of volunteering at a nearby women's shelter today!  I'm looking for some food to tide me over -- I know I will be able to scrape by after next week, so I don't want to take time or resources that people really need (gov't stuff, food pantry, etc). But I would so love a warm slice (or anything warm really) tonight, and some extra to save for the next few days to have around my (new and totally mine!) place.  Thanks, Reddit. I promise to pay it forward.  Edited: Wanted to add I can barter some stuff as well: I write, review video games and can score some codes for certain iTunes games, will send postcards from California (where I am!) or write you a personalized poem!!	1424917130.0

Got laid off back in December and the job hunt hasn't been going well. Starting to sell of possessions just to pay rent. Could a pizza help? Maybe. But I know it would be tasty.  Bit about me, left the air force after 10 years in April, moved to VA in July and got a pretty slick job doing IT/IA stuff for a government contract and then the funding fell out in December.

Earlier this week, I got some bummer news: I've got me  case of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. (Don't worry, I'm not gonna die! This cancer is very treatable.)

Hello fellow RAoPers, first time poster here so please tell me if I did something wrong :) i think i got everything down from the sidebar.

Dealing with that as well as a whopping $4 to last my family of three until Friday. A pizza would really lighten the mood around here	About four months ago I finally came to terms with being a transman and decided to come out to family members.  The reactions have been mixed, but the one person I thought would be supportive completely shut me down, doesn't take it seriously and just told me that I was gender confused because my mom "fucked me up emotionally" growing up. On top of that, both paychecks this month were much less than anticipated, and we now have $4 to last my partner, my two year old and I until Friday, with pretty much no food left except Chef Boyardee and a can of soup. We'd really appreciate even the smallest pizza right now.  EDIT: Don't know why I still have the got pizza'd flair, the last time that happened was over a year ago, sorry.	1423418472.0

Just one catch.	willing to donate a pizza or two to someone in need. I'm a college student majoring in sustainable food systems. The biggest challenge is educating people on the problems we face regarding food, so in exchange you have to research and provide one specific negative consequence of the production method of each topping you want on your pizza. Cheese is the bare minimum.   For example, tomatoes use a ridiculous amount of broadleaf herbicide to kill all the greenery around the fruits before they're harvested.  This has resulted in increased cancer rates among migrant workers in California central Valley.   If you just want a cheese pizza, tell me something bad about industrial dairy. If you want mushrooms or peppers or sausage, tell me something bad about how those things are produced conventionally.  Happy Saturday!  Edit: I've given away two Zza's this weekend and I've learned some stuff at the same time. Hopefully you guys continue to wonder about what's really going on behind the closed doors of America's food system. It's not all beautiful packaging and perfect produce.

Prove this to my with a link to a [Thanks] post in your honor. No post? Show me the post where you gave.

Since you're one for giving, show me that in art form! Using a medium other than a computer (electronics), create some artwork! Your theme is giving, so interpret that any way you see fit.  **How to submit:** Photograph your artwork and include the date, your /u/, and the sentence "It's good to give" on the piece. If for whatever reason this isn't possible, message me with your reasoning and I'll give you an alternative task.  **THAT'S IT!!!** Best of luck to you all.

t3_2uj1pn	1422894419.0	xkandicake	shroom	[Request]Short on rent and don't wanna "waste" what money I have on buying food.	So I moved into my new room two weeks ago, and had those two weeks to save up the $550 for rent I needed. Weeellll work wasn't very kind to me last week; I went home without taking any tables last Wednesday, made $40 as a food runner on Thursday, then $6 on Friday. This week was much better and I'm at about $430 wooo!  But, I'm off today and hungry. I will go to the store and buy food if I have to, but I'd rather not take a few steps back on my savings since i have to pay my storage unit this weekend, which is $160. >.<  I'll shout your kindness from the tops of the tallest mountains in Miami! :D  Also it's just me I need to feed. My roommates handle themselves sooo you only need to feed a wittle waitress! :D	1422895529.0
t3_2uguqo	1422841182.0	DavidShields	shroom	[Contest] I want to hear what makes you happy.	~~~ THIS CONTEST IS NOW OVER~~~  I said I'd pizza forward, and I am fulfilling that promise since I got my check last night. I will be giving away 2x $15 USD, 1 to each winner, giftcards to your choice of the big 3 (Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Papa John's).   I will leave this contest going until 8pm PST for the first winner and give away the second tomorrow at 5pm PST. I will not be choosing the winners per se, but rather reading entries and entering names into a random drawing from my Halloween candy cauldron. If you enter but do not win for the first drawing, I will leave your name in for the second.   The Contest:  I want to hear about 3 things that make you really, really happy. It could be a book, an action figure, a concert ticket stub, a certain time of day, person, animal... Anything, so long as it makes you happy, and it matters to you.   Furthermore, I want to see a picture of at least one of those things (close matches via pictures on the internet are acceptable, I know not everyone has a camera and I want to keep this accessible to as many people as possible).   The Rules:  * No bashing on anyone's entries. If you bash anyone's happiness I will remove your name and curse it with whatever I can.   * Entries over  3 paragraphs long will be disqualified. Generally try to keep your entry to a paragraph or two. I know that we all like to gush, but in the event that this becomes a heavily entered contest, I need to have time to read the entries!  * You can include more than one picture, but please share no more than 3 links unless you're going to make a quick gallery on imgur. The maximum picture allowance will be capped at 10 for time reasons.   * No NSFW pics. We all like to see parts of anatomy from time to time, but let's keep this PG please.   * No extreme language or graphic details os the NSFW variety. Same as the last rule, keep it generally PG please.   * No sob stories/stay on topic. We all have them, I get that. However this contest is not one of the emotional variety. I want this to be a positive experience for everyone.     That's pretty much it kids! Let's do this thing!  ___________________________________________________________________________  _EDIT 1_: Don't forget to include at least 1 picture guys! (Technically I didn't say it was required, so while I still prefer it, it's not a DQ for not having it there).  _Edit 2_: I forgot the I have a dinner to go to tomorrow night, so the deadline for the second drawing got moved to 5pm PST. Sorry about that!  Winner 1: Crack_the_nut!  Winner 2: Emilyeverafter!  _Final Edit_ Thanks everyone for entering. If I were a rich man, I'd giver everyone pizza, but I am a broke college student, so two is all I have in me for now. I hope that I can do this again sometime. You were all great and I hope that you have a great day and manage to get pizza from someone!	1422925288.0

I had made plans with two friends to come over and we can hang and watch movies on the laptop if they bring half the money it would take to order pizza for the night. About 12 hours later, they both bailed. I've learned that I have really *really* bad friends.. a pie would be nice, not really looking for money for much else. If I ordered breadsticks or wings solely with my money, I'll be hungry (and broke) by late night. I have fast metabolism and the pie will be my midnight snack and breakfast as well.

(I've had these issues my entire life, nothing I can fix, just live with it.) Needless to say we won't have time to cook tonight and with her probably losing her job and rent due on the first we could use a pickme up. We are in MI, hungry Howie's, jets, dominos and little ceasers near us.	1422581936.0

I just found out I'm having a BOY (his name is DEXTER) so I figured since I've had a very good month of freelance income and have received some very good news, that I would buy someone a pizza from PAPA JOHNS. (Sorry- my only option)   My only request is this- draw me something- paint me something- carve me something- just prove that you are the one who actually did it. Have a piece of art sitting around that your proud of? SHOW ME! It can be related to me, my baby, this sub, your mom, my mom, ANYTHING! No real rules.   This contest ends 24 hours from now. I will look at all the talented art and choose from there. Make sure if your scanning in material to watermark it so no bastards steal your work! :)   Hope to see some sweet stuff!!

t3_2twif2	1422403437.0	AnchorageGypsy	shroom	[REQUEST] Pregnancy sucks when you're in a bit of a pickle!	Preggers proof! http://imgur.com/zcvWMjf  I originally joined this sub because I wanted to be able to buy pizza for others, but in a turn of events, on New Years Eve, my fiance got laid off from work.  He just got hired on for a new job, & I have been working,only part time because I am pregnant, but suffer from Hyperemesis gravidarum (which is extreme nausea, vomiting- I can't keep food or water down without zofran.  Trust me, if I wasn't sick so much, I would LOVEEE to work full time) Now because I have only been working part time, we have essentially sold everything we can to pay for our bills, but now are short on rent and are down to the bare minimum as far as food goes.  We have a few cans of soup, some rice, some leftover chicken I made in the crockpot about a week ago, and this has to last us another week and a half.  It would mean a lot to my fiance and I if we can eat something different tonight since it is going to be a while before we can get legitimate groceries.   I don't have much to offer back except my gratitude, and the promise that when his paychecks are coming in, I return the offer to someone else in desperate need! ♡  I finish work at 9pm tonight & it would be amazing to be able to order something when I get home.   Thanks in advanced <3  And I hope everyone is having a wonderful Tuesday (:	1422416726.0
t3_2tw13h	1422395943.0	Anteater_Girl	PIF	[Offer] Someone pizza'd me last quarter when I was a broke ass student. I've got an extra $25 and would like to return the favor to a fellow student. It's midterms week, time to eat purely out of frustration.	[First off, thanks to the guy who gave me pizza last quarter. I was able to throw a little celebratory party and my roommie and I treated ourselves to beer since we didn't have to buy the pizza.]( http://imgur.com/MHUahag)  The first person that PM's me proof that they're currently a student gets a pizza tonight. I'm in class for the next two hours. I'll check my PM's, contact the lucky student, and send them a pizza.   Good luck on midterms everyone!  **EDIT** I found a lucky student! Keep the good karma flowing everyone. The day someone granted me pizza was oddly enough the day I gave a random girl an expensive textbook for free. All I'm sayin' is, pay it forward and make someone smile.	1422406092.0
t3_2tu1rp	1422361832.0	Franklyidontgivearip	PIF	[Request] Still here in the hospital with our daughter. We have 2 cans of Chef Boyardee, 2 servings of cereal, and 2 cups of ramen left. Can anyone help please?	It's 7:15 AM.  (I realize its early, but we would love to be able to order something for lunch.) We've been here since Thursday morning.  We've had canned food and dehydrated food each day.  My husband and I are both here with our daughter.  They're testing her for celiac, chrones, immunoglobulin deficiency, enzyme disorders, and FPIES.  We are going to be here for a while.  We have $50 left on the food stamp card, but I have no way to get to the grocery store when my husband leaves for work.  They have restricted the use of the refrigerator/freezer to patient use and parents single meals only, meaning that if I wanted to get 4 frozen food dinners for 2 meals for 2 people, I'd have to make 2 seperate trips.  We cannot use the fridge for drinks unless it is for use because of an allergy issue.  The grocery store my husband has been going to does not have a deli with fresh food like fried chicken or subs.  Papa Johns is the only chain pizza that will deliver to the hospital.    Can anyone please help us with a gift card?  EDIT:  We've received multiple gifts.  Thank you so much.  We look forward to repaying the kindness soon like we did last time.    Thanks everyone.    EDIT 2:  I am sorry.  I didn't realize my husband had accepted a 3rd gift.  He had no idea the first two had come in because he was not here and I had not updated the post after getting the first 2.  I was not here when the 3rd offer came in.  I was down in xray with my daughter.  If anyone would like their money back, I have no problems giving them the gift card numbers and passwords.	1422399393.0

t3_2tgeqp	1422053710.0	jeskersz	shroom	[REQUEST] Can't afford my medication, withdrawaling, using a ghetto-rigged ostomy bag and I'm hungry.	I posted this just a few minutes ago and deleted it.  I forgot to add [REQUEST] to the title and I figured that was more important than not deleting, since I'm assuming the no-deletion rule is there to prevent scamming and such.  If I was wrong about that please excuse me.  My girlfriend and I have lived together for almost 10 years (11 year anniversary will be the 28th). About 7 years ago, I got very sick and ended up having to get a permanent ileostomy (ostomy bag, if you don't know what it is and you're eating, don't look it up.)  I'm still waiting on disability payments to come through. My girlfriend got laid off recently, and we're now on the second week of not having any money left.  I can't afford the ostomy bags, so I'm using a plastic grocery bag duct-taped to my stomach.  I'm on methadone, because I was on pain medication for a long time and it's very hard to go off of, and the methadone helps with what little pain I have left on top of preventing opiate withdrawals. I can't afford it, and I'm very sick because of it.  We're now officially out of food, except one can of Homestyle Chicken Noodle Soup, two packets of kool-aid and a box of angelhair pasta.  After remembering about hearing about this sub, I figure the food is the only thing I might be able to do something about.  Apologies for the sob story, but I guess I kinda assumed that people like to hear about all the crap people have to go through when they come here.    Quick edit:  nursenightshift sent a gift card and the pizza is on its way.  Thank you so much. 	1422060715.0

Give me an idea of something you'd like photographed, I'll do a quick edit, and send it your way! No watermark and I give permission to do what you'd like with it.

Winner will be announced at 7pm Central.	**EDIT:** This was more fun than I anticipated. There are a lot of lame people out there with terrible reasons to deserve a free pizza. I was also cursed out, threatened, and stalked. Yes, I am a Royals fan and yes [this](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/assets/3233953/fatguykc.gif) is me, your threats to announce it to the world won't sway me.  **AND THE WINNER IS /u/thekingearl, for being in too high of a tax bracket ever qualify for anything free.**  **Thanks again for playing, this was a blast. Keep an eye out, I'm thinking about doing this again.**  **EDIT 2:** Shout out to my new hype man, /u/jack_gray. He gets a consolation $10 e-gift card for literally commenting on all of my stuff.  There's certainly nothing wrong with being charitable, in fact, I encourage it. However, with this contest, I only want to hear pathetic, petty, and lame reasons that you deserve a pizza from me.  I'm giving away the pizza, so I get to be the judge. Upvotes will not determine my decision, but could influence. You have a bigger chance of winning if you make me laugh and/or your response is creative.  The contest ends at 7pm central and is an e-gift card from Domino's. When I declare the winner, you claim the prize by PMing me your email so I can send the card.  Admission to violent crimes, being racist, or a Yankees fan will disqualify you. I'm looking for a person with a bad excuse for needing pizza, not Satan.	1421888328.0

Ordered myself a couple of pizzas to cheer myself up and received a couple on a previous account while going through school, so I'm looking to pass it forward and to a fellow Packer fan. First time giving, so may need some patience on ordering.  Post a picture in your Packer gear with timestamp and username in picture. Must be in US. Two month requirement for accounts, but older the better and also better if active in /r/GreenBayPackers. Papa John's locations must be available. Bonus points for outfit creativity, including your drink of choice, guessing my drink of choice, and Woodson jerseys. Why Woodson? Because he's awesome, reminds me of a happier time, and why not? How much pizza? TBD by PM after selection.  Will select winner tonight by 9pm CST (pending entries--photo requirement may prolong this). We can talk if you want the pizza tonight or another time then.   EDIT: 9pm deadline be damned. I'm extending it and giving out multiple so keep posts coming until my edit says otherwise.  Though I might be a day tardy in getting to new posts given my current condition and need for sleep.	1421636314.0

t3_2soxgi	1421458354.0	gorillagnomes	pizza	[Request] I've been super duper sick AND just started a new job. Pizza heals, right guys?	Hi there from Austin, Tx.  Just started a new job after a a very, very lean winter spent working a job that unexpectedly cut my hours due to weather (it's an outdoor job).  I've been sick all week, faking it until I make it at my new job. When I'm not at work, I'm basically plastered to the couch watching Netflix, hacking up a lung, drinking tea, and cuddling my tiny cat [Zoe](http://imgur.com/AQPCkQN).  Should someone feel so inclined to send a pizza my way, I'll be sure to pay it forward when I can.  I've never requested a pizza before, so let me know if I forgot to include any important info.  *edit* oh, and I did the whole "verification" doohickey	1421458611.0

t3_2sl7dw	1421376926.0	okdanasrsly	shroom	[Offer] In honor of our new sub /r/Need! Tell me your tale of need, and tomorrow someone's getting pizza!	In honor of /r/Need going live, I'm going to give a pizza to the person (or persons!) whose tale of need moves me the most. This can be you helping someone in need, a time you were in need where someone helped you, or anything else that you feel sums up a time in your life where need was experienced.   So, without further ado....As a further service to Redditors in crisis, financial or otherwise, we are proud to announce /r/Need: a place to find and help Redditors in need. As many of us are mods both here at /r/Borrow and at /r/Need, we look forward to providing the same level of active moderation in hopes of better serving the Reddit community than is currently available. We are here not only to help those in need, but to make sure those giving help are not being taken advantage of. Because of this goal, we are working closely with other material-based subs and will make sure that if you've stolen from a Redditor, you will not be given that opportunity again. We respectfully request that only Redditors who have been a part of the Reddit community for 30 days or more request help at /r/Need, because this is meant to be a place for real Redditors, not just anyone who happens to google "help."  So what better place to start than with your need for cheesy delicious goodness? We hope to see you all at /r/need! Thank you all, for all you do!   EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who partcipated! A winner has been chosen and messaged. If they do not respond tonight, I will pick a new winner. Thanks again everybody, and we hope to see you around /r/need!   /u/nivanglus has responded, and accepted their pizza prize!

t3_2sk0lc	1421356025.0	amsoell	pizza	[Contest] Enjoy a delicious Papa John's pizza for me	I love pizza. I also love my wife, and she has roped me into this crazy [Whole 30](http://whole30.com) diet for the month. No grain. No cheese. No processed foods. In other words, no pizza.   It's not all bad, but I do miss digging into a delicious pie. I'm particularly craving some Papa John's which is weird because I'm not usually wild about theirs. But today is payday, and I'm looking for someone hungry for some Papa John's who can enjoy a pie for me.  So if you're in Papa John's delivery range (most of the US, right?) post what you like on your pizza. The comment with the most delicious-sounding pizza gets the pie.  EDIT: Oh man, I'm really regretting starting this post—all I can think about are these awesome sounding pizzas! I PM'ed the author who made me drool the most, but keep 'em coming in the event that The Papa doesn't deliver on their area. 	1421369043.0

For medical reasons my wife hasn't been able to have any dairy for almost a year.  We've been planning to have a nice pizza and movie night once the issue was past (which it now has) but unfortunately post-holidays money is way too tight to do it until at least February.  I'd appreciate any help in pulling out a surprise and will certainly pay it forward once money's back to normal.  Thanks regardless!

t3_2rl4hd	1420598861.0	TheAnneThorne	shroom	[request] sad trans girls (and friends) could really use some pizza	Hi! I'm Justine. I'm a 22 year old, recently dumped transgender girl living in Charlotte, North Carolina: and I could really use some pizza.  Story time! You know what I spent today doing? Nothing. Literally nothing. I left my bed once to go to the bathroom, but other than that I didn't eat. Or drink. Or sleep really. I was dumped last night, by a man that controlled me emotionally and financially for *two years*. I was left by him- for the better- but desperately sad, alone, and used. I feel pretty empty but I managed to get up the courage to ask for a favor.  I don't need money. I'll find a job- I'll find something. I don't want any superfluous act of charity. I'm a big girl. I made my mess, and now I'll lie in it.  But me and my roommates could really use some fucking pizza.   Pizza is my ultimate comfort food. I ate it the night my parents divorced (Little Caesar's). I ate it the day my mom passed out drunk on New Years after eating too many prescription pills (Pizza Hut). I ate it the night I found out my Mom died (Domino's).   I just don't really have ~~any~~the money right now to be eating out.   If you decide to help that'd be cool! I might even shuffle you some pictures because, hey, I'm single. But at any rate, thanks for listening to my soap box.  Here's hoping for some pizza :)   - Justine Catherine  (ps I'm on my friends reddit acct bc I don't have one, hence why I didn't sign off An Thorne)	1420602938.0

I came home for the Christmas break and have the second term off, but my parents have left today to go on a vacation and I'm left to fend on my own.  This wouldn't be so bad if the "client" I had recently spent a month of work for had paid up, but instead they said "the project was dead" and didn't want to pay me. I have no money left after spending most of it getting home but I had enough to buy my train ticket home tomorrow. I'd love if someone could hook me up with a pizza for tonight and if I can convince this guy that I deserve pay, I'll pay it forward.

t3_2qdz3z	1419539062.0	homeless_wonders	pizza-gold	[Offer] Are you working, or could you not go to your families for Christmas?	US Only, sorry guys!  Comment with whatever proof you can provide, and I'll pick 2 or 3 people to give a E-Gift card to one of the big 3:  Papa Johns, Pizzahut, or Dominoes.   Tell me the story behind it, which place you want it from, and why you think pizza would make it better Just looking to spread some Christmas joy.  **EDIT** Hey guys, sorry I couldn't get it for everyone, I've already messaged the users that I picked and sent them the gift cards. Hopefully some other kind soul will pick up where I left off. I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas.  **EDIT** Merry Christmas, I went ahead and got 5 people pizza instead of going 3, I just couldn't resist but I'm over budget for the year now, so I won't be able to get anymore pizza without taking out my own grocery funds. Thank you guys for giving me the opportunity to do this.	1419546198.0

t3_2q1h7j	1419224651.0	Skim74	shroom	[Offer/Contest] Draw a picture, win a Papa John's 1 topping!	So I guessed /u/MCRAGEQUIT's favorite Christmas song, which reminded me I had pizza in the fridge. So I went and ate that, so I'm passing the code forward!  The contest is: Draw a picture! The catch is it must be done in 5 minutes or less. Any format, MS paint, an app on your phone, pen and paper (and just take a pic, no need for scanners and shit up in here).  Optional themes: Christmas, Scooby Doo, The Sound of Music, Friends (like the show, or people who just happen to be friends). Or whatever else. I'll pick a winner in an hour/before I go to bed, whenever that may be.  (EDIT) I"m going to sleep. Feel free to post tonight (and even spend more than 5 minutes if you want) and I'll pick a winner tomrrow	1419226752.0
t3_2q0z9f	1419213865.0	MCRAGEQUIT	pizza-gold	[Contest] One topping pie from Papa John's if you can guess my favorite Christmas song.	**CONTEST OVER:**  **Congrats to /u/Skim74 for ["Happy Xmas/War is Over" by John Lennon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXaLu7bvke8) and Congrats to /u/armedliberalinmo for ["Do they know it's Christmas" by BandAid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE)**   **There ya go!  Now you know my two favorite Christmas songs.  Merry Christmas everyone!**  .   My husband spent all day putting up lights (better late than never!) and I finally got around to decorating my mantle and wrapping all the gifts for friends and family.  We were in no mood to cook, so I ordered a from Papa John's, but instead of paying directly, I bought a gift card to cover it and that gave me a code for a free one topping pizza.   I am fortunate to not need that code, so **I am giving it to the first person who guesses my favorite Christmas song.** I will be checking in from time to time and add hints if need be.    .   **UPDATE** I realized that I actually do have 2 favorite songs.  Congrats to /u/Skim74 who guessed *"Happy Christmas/War is Over" by John Lennon* which is the song I was referring to!  .  **Now, I do have a second favorite, which my husband reminded me of, so there is still a chance.  This song is a little embarrassing to admit that I like, but hopefully offering a pizza in return will cancel out the shame.  Same deal, guess the song, get a free one topping pizza from Papa John's.  Good luck!**  .  **Second song hint:** A lot of people make fun of it.  Actually, most of the time I hear people talk about it is to make fun of it or say something bad about it.   **One more hint:**  This song is newer than my first song, but not much newer.  	1419228217.0

t3_2pur3o	1419046406.0	ls1003	PIF	[Request]Down on my luck lately, $4 on my card, just got an eviction notice	So I've had some unexpected financial trouble lately and have been running it pretty thin for a few weeks. My landlord has been absent for about 3 months and 2 weeks ago, my bathroom ceiling caved in due to leaky pipes coming from the upstairs apartment. He came by today to inspect the damage and serve a 5 day notice to pay rent or vacate due to (what he claims is) $2,000 in unpaid rent.    As I'm broke as it is, I don't really have any money to throw at him to get him to shut up, so I'm trying to work out a deal with him. Meanwhile, I've ran out of food from my last trip to Aldi and I work third shift so making it to the food pantry is very difficult for me.    I'm hoping someone can help me out with a pie this weekend, it would probably feed me into early next week because I can (thankfully) get free breakfast at work (just a bagel and some cereal-but thats enough for me).    If you get me a pie, I'll pizza it forward when I'm in a better situation, and I'll see what I can do about writing you a song based off of your username.     Two quick edits: I did pizza someone a few months ago, but never got my flair. I'm also willing to provide proof of all of the above if asked for. 	1419047400.0

My puppy and I would like a pizza.	**Thank you MCRAGEQUIT!**    ~~It's a new day now but our protagonist would still like a pizza if someone was willing to offer one. He's spending the day going through a modern thriller complete with heart pounding action and suspense but the mood is being ruined by the rumble of his stomach.~~    **Below is my original request from the other sub copy/pasted.**    ~~I do have quite an excellent sob story if you really want to hear it. It covers loss and sorrow and is even peppered with moments of happiness and glimmers of hope that get squashed. There is a pretty awesome protagonist to this tale as well. The most important bit of the story though is that he and his puppy are hungry. They will survive until Monday when they can get more food (aka payday!), however if someone was kindhearted enough to throw a pizza their way to coast them through the weekend with some flavor instead of blandness they would be eternally grateful.~~   [Here is the aforementioned puppy](http://imgur.com/gallery/Ta3G8Qr/)    ~~For those curious this is my second time having a reddit account. My original i deleted over the summer after 2 years. (Check me out on redditgifts at my current username and you'll see my history over there spans more than this accounts 3 months.) I have received a pizza and given a few here in the past so its quite likely ill be back around to hook someone up again when my luck turns around.~~   ~~I live in Missouri,  we have papa johns, pizza hut, and dominos that all deliver. I prefer Papa Johns and Dominos personally but im not picky.  Its just me, my puppy who despite everyone saying its horrible for her will actually eat pizza (she loves it, shes actually 7 years old but you wouldnt know it by her energy level), and my two fluffy asshole cats who hate pizza but love to play with the box afterwards.~~   ~~Feel free to ask any questions you want. I have pictures of the animals if people want to see. I also post to imgur under my old reddit username still and you can check it out if you want.

t3_2ntzi3	1417337986.0	chloe-bell	PIF	[Offer] Artists of Reddit!!! $25 Pizza Hut gift card for a portrait of my cat!	ETA: I've extended til Wednesday, 12/10  I've gotten some PMs requesting more time :)  Ok... so, to put it bluntly, I am chronically poor and I need a Christmas gift for my 18 year old son. For years he's been saying how he wishes he could find someone to do a portrait of Sammy, our beloved rescued family cat that we've had since 2006... who is particularly fond of my son and stalks the crap out of him and meows (loudly) all night when he's gone.   We recently found out that Sammy has dental tumors and will need to eventually be put to sleep when the pain gets too bad and he can no longer eat... there is no cure or surgery thay can remove the tumors  :(   My son graduates in June and goes off to college next year, so a portrait of Sammy would be awesome for him to take along to remember him.  I wish I could do better than a $25 gift card or have a better variety, but we are given restaurant gift cards at work when we work overtime (because we're salaried and they think $25 makes up for 12 hours of work) and we don't get to pick.    I would like to have the portrait mailed to me so I can frame it (8x10) and can pay for shipping as long as its not over $10. A cardboard envelope for usps flat rate should do and shouldn't be more than $6 - that we can figure out later.  For now, I'll choose my favorite on Wednesday night at 8pm and pm you the gift card info... or order your pizza for you, doesn't matter to me.  We can work out shipping after you get your pizza... but please be willing to mail it... this is the most important part!  Sammy is a blue point Siamese with blue eyes... he's sort of light greyish with darker points and has more of a fuller face than typical Siamese cats.

t3_2nmkvb	1417137642.0	pankocrunch	pizza	[Offer] Spending Thanksgiving in a hotel in Fallon, NV. A pizza for a laugh.	Circumstances have me sitting in a hotel in...lovely...Fallon, NV with my boyfriend and our dog on Thanksgiving. While this wasn't exactly where we expected to be tonight, we're together. Earlier, we swung by Safeway, picked up some misc, and we'll soon be enjoying turkey sandwiches and beer in the hotel's lobby.  I'd like to help out a few others that aren't as fortunate as us tonight. I have 3 Pizza Hut gift cards to offer; however, the sob stories are getting me down. So, I'd ask that you send out some Thanksgiving cheer in this thread. I'll PM the first three people to make me and my BF laugh, be happy, or simply have thankful feels.  Edit: I should mention that Fallon, NV doesn't have much internet, so Youtube videos are hard to watch. To enjoy what you've posted thus far, we've extrapolated heavily from their titles and have been simulating them on the hotel room's notepad. Don't worry, though. We're headed west to Californy tomorrow. We hear there's more internet there. But no more Youtubes tonight please. My wrist hurts and we're almost out of paper.  Edit 2: Eagle-eyed readers will notice that I've offered up my 3 gift cards. I enjoyed this thread so much...and particularly a PM conversation with /u/freshoutofeggs...that I attempted to order 3 more Pizza Hut gift cards; however, the hard-working robots at [Yum! Brands, Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Hut) have decided that I'm likely committing credit card fraud and denied my transaction. I'm sorry. Perhaps, once their shipment of lug nuts arrives, they'll be less cranky tomorrow and won't shaft us. We can only hope.	1417147771.0

So, here it is, but there's a catch. (There's always a catch, am I rite? Ok, maybe not always, but in this instance, anyway). I am offering a $25 Domino's eGift card to whomever is able to guess my favorite Movie.  You could scroll through my comment history, but I deleted anything that may give it away. That being said, while these movies are SOME of my favorites, the film is not:  Rampart  Twilight or it's better contemporary, [Twinklight]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=twinklight)  Harry Potter (I've neither seen nor read anything Harry Potter. GO AHEAD AND STONE ME, I'M ALREADY STONED!)  Anything directed by Nathaniel Hornblower  STIPS: Winner must have an active account at least one month old. Winner may have collected on previous offers or requests. Winner must be verified by RAOP's Verification System located in the sidebar. Anyone PMing me will be immediately disqualified. If no one has guessed correctly, I will choose a comment at random and present the winner with his/her gift card.  Good luck RAoP, and god's on speed.  EDIT As /u/CapitalistBrony pointed out: >You didn't necessarily say it is a vampire movie that's your favorite. Not having a single clue of being able to guess isn't exactly good :/  Here's the 1st hour hint, taken directly from the comments: >Here's a hint: I have Total Recall, RoboCop 2, and 30 Rock all 5 starred on NetFlix. The last time I did this contest, I revealed my favorite TV show to be Degrassi (still is, RIP Adam). Keep guessing.  Oh, and it's totally not a Vampire Movie, DO YOU HEAR ME, *Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant*, NOT A VAMPIRE MOVIE!  *****EDIT 2 WE HAVE OUR FIRST WINNER***** /u/Postaback made a correct guess with *Starship Troopers*.  **BUT I HAVE MORE THAN ONE FAVORITE MOVIE SO KEEP GUESSING!!!!!**  EDIT 3: Please keep each guess listed to a separate comment so I can review and reply easier, please and thank you.  ****EDIT 4 WE HAVE ANOTHER WINNER**** /u/usctrojangirl won the second offer with her guess *Terminator*  ****I STILL HAVE MORE THAN 2 FAVORITE MOVIES, SO KEEP GUESSING, FOO!****  ****EDIT 5 ANOTHER WINNER DISCOVERED**** /u/i_steal_space_plans has stolen a correct guess.  CONGRATULATIONS!  ****KEEP GUESSING****  ****EDIT 6**** /u/andsendunits has guessed the last correct answer with *True Romance*  ****FINAL EDIT****  All winning parties have been contacted. I'm sorry I had to lie and deceive the good people of RAoP into thinking there would be only one winner, when in fact, there are four, all of whom have been gilded for a month.   Please post pics of yourself with your prizes. You are all awesome and truly winners in my book! Enjoy your pies and remember how fun it is to pay it forward, even if you didn't win.  ****YOU ARE ALL WINNERS!!!

Submit a joke and this Sunday night on or about 8PM Hawaiian Standard Time I'll pick the funniest entrant for a $20 gift card to you name it pizza place.	**Details**  HST is UTC - 10 hours  All you need to do to enter is submit a joke.  Jokes may be mundane, culturally smart, crude, politically incorrect, whatever...if you look at my posting history I love all kinds of jokes from stupid to smart to crude to whatever.  In mind with the above statement I usually read super popular joke threads, so while you are welcome to recycle a joke from elsewhere on reddit, if you do it's likely I've heard it before, which diminishes your chances. I'm hoping to hear a funny new joke I haven't heard before.  To gauge my sense of humor with a gun to my head my favorite jokes would maybe be:  - "edgy" *Why did the Heaven's Gate Cult commit suicide? They were just trying to keep up with the Joneses...I'd tell a Jonestown joke as well but I don't think you'd like that punch line.*  - "stupid" *How do you shoe a horse? You wave your arms madly and yell, 'Shew horesey, shew, get outta here, scram!"*  Really I love all jokes.   **All may play...if the big three aren't in your area (or you're non-US, whatever) we'll work something out.**  Make me laugh.  **EDIT: The contest is now closed, and the winner has been notified by PM.

It really helps me out.  To those of you interested in following the comic, there is an RSS feed at www.space-couch.com/feed.xml ****************************************************************  I was really pleased with the results when I did this last month, so as promised I'm giving away pizza again as a way to promote my pizza-loving comic, [Two Aliens on a Space Couch!](http://www.space-couch.com), and this time I'm giving away twice as many gift cards!  So, I will be purchasing a total of 14 gift cards, each worth $15.  Everyone who wins will get to choose whether their card is from Dominos or Papa Johns.  How do you get your hands on one?  Same basic idea as last time.  I've got a webcomic that I'd love your help promoting, so anyone who posts or PMs a screenshot of them sharing a link to my website (www.space-couch.com) on Facebook or Twitter will be eligible to win one of these cards.  Who wins is entirely random, with everyone getting an equal shot.  I will choose winners at 1PM PST on October 31st, so anyone who has an entry in by then has a shot at a gift card.  You don't have to say anything about the comic in your post, just have to post the link.  Anything you say to help me out above and beyond that is always much appreciated.  You all were pretty awesome last time about this, and I believe some of you have been indeed following the comic, which is great!  So, I hope you enjoy the comic, but if nothing else I hope you enjoy the pizza.  Best of luck to all of you!	1414786806.0

EDIT: I did recently pay it forward with the pizza I received last time but through a different subreddit, if anyone is curious. 	1414624999.0

So, I dunno, make a House of Cards. Ever done it? Harder than it seems. Best I've been able to do is a simple three level triangular structure. So, get creative, and have a steady hand.

You people come to this sub, beg and plead for free pizza, and then all you have to *build* *a* *house* *of* *cards* to get it, and only **2** people respond?! Guess all these sob stories really are bullshit. I'm speechless.   **Final** **Edit**: /u/SamuraiDDD wins, and with a personal note, I am utterly shocked by the lack of participation. This easy contest proves that you sorry sad sacks are full of shit, if any of you really needed food you would *at* *least* submitted *something* because the winner's submission was so small it can barely be considered a house. As such I've **doubled** the prize to **$50** worth of pizza. Fuck you all!	1414822331.0

t3_2kgsjz	1414420184.0	k12573n	PIF	[Offer] Tell me about your family troubles	[CLOSED - NO MORE ENTRIES]  I want to send someone a pizza for dinner today.  I have been pizza'd before and I want to help someone out.  Recently, I have become pretty depressed over my dad's struggles in family court with my little brother and his mother.  It has been a long, expensive, grueling 8-year battle and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  It's become very much a crisis and I want to hear about other people's family problems.  I'm just going to pick someone by random.  I'll check back at 5 pm when I get off work to announce my pizza recipient.  Thanks!  Edit1 @ 3:32 pm:  I am so overwhelmed by the responses here.  I wish I could send each and every one of you a pizza and a great big hug.  I have decided to pizza 2 people from this thread this evening.  I wish I could do more.  I'll post the winners shortly after I stop accepting entries at 5 pm.  Edit2 @ 5:03 pm:  The winners are #1 (/u/AyeshaPorno) and #16 (/u/minorharmony).  Sorry to everyone else, I am thinking about doing this once or twice a month and picking from who is left here so that everyone who responded today gets a pizza eventually.  Edit 3 @ 3:57 pm 11/10/14:  I am giving away another pizza to someone who replied to this original offer.  The random number picker picked #13 (/u/-baabaa_blacksheep-) this time.   I also noticed that I assigned two people #20, so if they get picked in the future I will have to do eenie-meanie-miney-mo. :/	1415656732.0

Keep the messages coming.**  **Edit 2: Okay, it looks like I have to stop now. Both Dominos and Pizza Hut have started declining my purchases for "security reasons", and now I'm getting text alerts from my bank's fraud department.  Please PM me if you were waiting for an egift card from Dominos or Pizza Hut, and you're willing to get Papa Johns instead. Thanks again to everyone making sacrifices to help others.**  I'm making an offer in observance of the sacrifice made by [Cpl. Nathan Cirillo](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/cpl-nathan-cirillo-shot-dead-in-ottawa-dreamed-of-becoming-full-time-soldier-1.2808960), who died yesterday serving his country. My offer goes out to anyone from any country who is currently serving in the military, police force, EMTs, and fire department, including dependants. I'll be giving out $25 egift cards to as many people as I can.  Private message me your proof of service (DD-214, ID, etc) with personal details removed, along with the email address where you would like to receive the egift card, and whether you want Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, or Dominos. I'm only sending egift cards from those pizzerias. For those who live outside of the U.S., please check the website for your local pizza joint to ensure they accept egift cards. I already know Papa Johns in Canada does not accept them. You're out of luck if I can't send an egift card to your country.  I'm getting ready for bed, but I'll start sending out the egift cards when I wake up. Again, the offer goes out to any country, but you're out of luck if I can't send an egift card from the U.S. I don't really have a limit on the number of egift cards I'll send.

I posted here last week, but apparently without sufficient pathos, so here goes:   1) Got laid off from job. Filed for UI. Sketchy employer did not report wages to EDD. So no UI until 4-8 weeks while they investigate. In the meantime, ALL of final check went to rent.   2) Two days after layoff, twist my ankle on wet tile floor. Haven't been able to walk more than a block for literally three weeks. Can't look for work. And because sketchy employer didn't report wages, California state disability is out of the question.   3) I'm on my own on the 4th floor of a walk-up. No roommates nor SO, just my older sister who has other shit to do than look after me.   4) Because I haven't been able go more than a block from my apartment, I can't follow up on any CalFresh stuff, because in order to get anything done you need to see someone in person. Good luck trying to call anyone and expect 30 days for your online application to be processed.   So yeah, I'm feeling frustrated, screwed, scared and hungry. If someone could help I'd be eternally grateful. Thanks.  	1413658352.0

All I currently have is stuff for a pot roast or home made chili lol.  Edit: I've given pizzas out on my old account several times and it gave one on this account last week. I will continue to throw pies at people's faces in the future lol.	1412711819.0

t3_2idpcc	1412537833.0	Waytooboredforthis	shroom	[Request] Another broke college student (West NC)	So I was supposed to go home this weekend, but I had too much homework and work hours to catch up on. Friday night, I decided to take a break from that (finished two paintings for my art class, wrote one three page paper, caught up on my shelf reading, caught up on my regular library hours, finally resupplied the janitor's closet [even though it's not my job], took an online quiz for my business class, and read a book for my history class) and go to a party with a lot of free booze. I had one 40 and one nice beer, then accidentally threw up on a dog (afterwards spent half an hour trying to clean him up). I didn't know what was up because I was tipsy, but not that drunk, and I've never thrown up from drinking as I've always tried to be pretty conscious of my tolerance, turns out I am actually, legitimately sick. I stayed in last night, and I'm feeling pretty good now, I was able to keep down a ham sandwich that my friend got me while she was out at Ingles this morning, but I'm out of credits to eat at the cafeteria for the week (which works for me because they're serving chicken tonight, and after working at a chicken factory, even the smell makes me nauseous), I only have $0.13 in the bank, and all I have to eat tonight is the large amount of crumbs at the bottom of a bag of potato chips. A local pizza place offers a great special for my college that would keep me in leftovers for the next few days after I get off work. I appreciate y'all getting this far into the post, and hope everyone has a great day!      Edit: Also, I've never successfully done this, so I have *no* idea what to do after I put my initial post up	1412538872.0

t3_2htdm2	1412018843.0	MidnightJester	pizza-gold	[Offer]Help out a Struggling Webcomic Creator by Bumming Pizza Off of Him	***************** FINAL EDIT: Alright, the winners have been chosen.  If you won, you have already been notified, but these were the winners:  reformedmikey bordot drmonix councilman_jamm konnichiwa AquaTreats redloveone  I wanted to take a moment to let you all know how much I really appreciate everyone who submitted for this.  So many of you really went above and beyond what I asked, saying great things and making me feel great about the comic I've made.  I know I'm the one giving out the pizza, but I truly feel like the lucky one here.  Your efforts have helped me indeed have a very happy birthday.  Stay hungry, because I will absolutely be back to do this, or something like this, again.  Probably about once a month.  Y'all are great, and congratulations to those of you lucky enough to win! *****************  Hey there, pizza lovers!  Have I got a deal for you.  I've got 7 $15 gift cards for pizza that I'm going to be giving away today.  If you win one, you'll be able to let me know if you'd prefer Dominos or Papa Johns, as I have not purchased them yet.  As mentioned in the title, I've got a webcomic running that I'd love some help spreading the word about.  If I had to boil down the core elements of this comic into three simple concepts, I'd say scifi, videogames, and pizza (which is what brought me here).  So, what am I asking of you?  If you'd like a chance at one of these gift cards, I ask that you post a link to www.space-couch.com on facebook, then show me a screengrab of that as proof.  You don't have to say anything about it if you don't want to, but anything you do would be much appreciated.  Everybody who follows this procedure will have an equal shot at winning one of the seven cards.  I'll randomly determine the winners at 8 PST and then get in contact with those people.  So, anyone who spreads the word before then will be eligible to win.  Best of luck to you, and hopefully some of you just might find that you like the webcomic too!  EDIT: And yes, I'm certainly aware that people can fake facebook posts.  I ask that you please don't.  I'm just some regular guy trying to get a webcomic out there.  In fact, I'm about the most "some regular guy" you can get.  The picture you have in your head right now of "some regular guy"?  That's probably pretty close.  EDIT2: For those of you who prefer, sharing it over Twitter is also just fine.  EDIT3: Since it's come up a few times, those of you that prefer to PM me the screenshot, that is also just fine.  I get not wanting to share the screengrab with everyone.	1412046211.0

There might be other people here who are in more of a need of food than I. Cheers. Simon.	1410882864.0
t3_2gig4p	1410826742.0	FlutestrapPhil	shroom	[Request] Living on 1 turkey sandwich per day, could really use a win right now (Rhode Island)	EDIT: REQUEST FULFILLED, big ups to u/djbosio14!    I don't want to make an overly desperate sob story here, so I'm just going to quickly list the things that suck in this situation and then move on to some possible barter ideas.  Sob story:  Cancer survivor, chronic back pain, need to smoke cannabis for it (for which I have a legal card in RI) but I've just run dry and can't afford to buy more at the moment. My girlfriend and I live with her dad, he said he'd pay for groceries when we moved in but he often forgets due to PTSD medication and brain damage from a stroke, and bringing it up with him doesn't really help and just makes him upset. I had to quit my job today because it was bad for my back pain and I'm trying to stop taking opiates for it as much now that I have the MMJ. We've been living on like 1 sandwich per day for a while now, and it's really taking its toll. Constantly hungry and irritable, and unable to stop dwelling on the recent death of one of my closest friends. I wish I could just crawl into a hole and die, but eating pizza and watching classic Doctor Who would probably be better.  Some less sad stuff:  My girlfriend is going to be starting a new job next week in the field she went to school for, and we'll finally have financial stability and food money. As far as skills that could potentially be used in a barter, I have a degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and could use my knowledge to help with homework assignments or just satiate your curiosity. I also know how to play several instruments including drums, guitar (rhythm), and native american flute. I can't sing very well, but I do okay with some songs.  Anyway, this post ran on longer than I planned, so I'll just wrap it up and say we would both really appreciate it if someone could send us some pizza from Domino's. 	1410835858.0
t3_2gea46	1410726275.0	Waytooboredforthis	shroom	[Request] Extremely broke but extremely happy and just want an after work snack.	So real talk, I don't have a big problem that is putting me out, nor even a small one. I lived on $0.45, a bag of fun size Baby Ruth bars, and beer I earned through random tasks the whole weekend, despite that, it was a really great weekend. I met a girl that I'm already kinda crazy about and  we got a date this Friday, I met a whole host of new folks, I found my Warren Zevon cd, I got to go fishing with my roommate, I wrote something that's halfway decent (which is pretty big for me considering I haven't written without a gun to my head in months), I found $5 and bought a nice beer (a first for me), even with quite a few bad things happening, it still just feels like it was a really good weekend and I'm really happy. Tomorrow, I'll probably crash hard, but tonight, I'd like to keep the ball rolling and be able to enjoy some actual food after I get off work tonight. I appreciate if you read this far and know that I'll try and return the favor once I finally sell my Fest 13 ticket. Have a good day!      Edit: Thank y'all for upvoting and the like, but my local pizza place has just closed and it's probably best I don't get some tonight anyways. But seriously, I appreciate everyone who read it, reading it. Have a good night!	1410753655.0

[Request] Yep...in a selfless act of loving kindness to my dear cat [Watson](http://i.imgur.com/5jR0RLe.jpg), I spent pretty much my last money (except, you know, rent money) for the next couple weeks on cat food for him. So, I am again relegating myself to eating canned beans (and cold ones, at that! My stove doesn't work) until I get paid again in a couple weeks. In a way, if you send me pizza, you've helped to facilitate Watson's continued existence as my feline companion here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.	1410395670.0

t3_2fz4jm	1410321430.0	AlkyIHalide	pizza	[Contest] Pizza for a randomly chosen MBTI type	Here is how this will work: I have made a [pie chart](http://imgur.com/aVKmxGI) based on the data from [this site](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.htm). The pie chart will be printed out and taped over a dart board. Since I have terrible aim throwing darts, it may as well end up almost anywhere. Because multiple people may have the same personality type, I will then collect the usernames of all the people who have the selected personality type and throw it in a RNG to pick the winner of a fine pizza. The contest is open from Wednesday 12am to Friday 12am in EST.  If you don't know what MBTI is or haven't taken a test, this is a test for it: http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp  Details: 1) If you win, you must use the [verification system](http://rikbrown.co.uk/rop/) or I will pick another person.  2) I understand that population frequency of a certain type skews a type in favor. So this has been adjusted accordingly. 3) The winner gets a maximum of $25USD for pizza. 4) If I PM the winner, please get back to me within a day. 5) For entry, just post your MBTI!  I don't want to limit it strictly to the US. Perhaps if it is allowed, I can use an honor system to send money to the winner via Paypal where he/she can post a picture of the pizza. Have fun!  **Edit:**The contest is closed. Thanks for playing guys. Here's some data on the people who posted: ISTJ-7.2% ISFJ-8.4% INFJ-9.6% INTJ-20.5% ISTP-8.4% ISFP-7.2% INFP-10.8% INTP-6.0% ESTP-0% ESFP-1.2% ENFP-4.8% ENTP-3.6% ESTJ-2.4% ESFJ-3.6% ENFJ-3.6% ENTJ-2.4%  Conclusion: INTJ's are attracted to pizza. ESTP's are out at a party somewhere wondering who will order the pizza.  And of course: my dart ended up picking **ENTJ**. There were only two ENTJ's who posted. So I decided a coin flip between /u/PelorTheBurningHate and /u/cb_. It appears /u/cb_ won! Thanks again for posting everyone!	1410496570.0
t3_2fwf3t	1410264779.0	VelocityRD	pizza	[Contest] I turn 26 today and feel like giving more than receiving, so here's your chance to win yourself some pizza!	**EDIT 2 (9/10/2014, 8:40AM):** Last night, after several readings of the page, I whittled my entries down to the winners. Yeah, winner**s**. I planned on doing this all along, but decided to keep it a little secret until I awarded the two prizes. I actually gave away *two* $26 gift cards last night: to /u/Eroy and /u/creativexangst, for their great gift stories ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2fwf3t/contest_i_turn_26_today_and_feel_like_giving_more/ckdr7ur) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2fwf3t/contest_i_turn_26_today_and_feel_like_giving_more/ckdhzbx)). Thank you all for entering -- this was great fun!  **Note: This will be the first time I've given through RAoP, so bear with me.**  Today (September 9) is my birthday! I'm now in the upper half of my 20s, which according to the girl I'm dating means I'm officially a [crotchety old man.](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/2126096/grumpy-clint-eastwood-o.gif) *So, uh, get off my lawn or something.*  To celebrate, I'm going to give away **$26 worth of pizza goodness to [the pizza chain of your choice]**! What does that mean?  * If you prefer one of the Big Three, it'll mean an online gift card! * If it's not one of the Big Three (e.g., your favorite local joint), you'll have to keep the order total to $26 (delivery fee not included).  I'm offering that second option because when it comes to food and dining out, I really enjoy finding and trying local places instead of the typical chain offerings. One of my favorite pizza places was actually a small, one-store place in my hometown, called The Barn. (It actually looks like a barn, too. Sadly, no cows were on premises -- they'd milked their fame and [acted like this](http://33.media.tumblr.com/d2ab949e1bddad229149b2d9dc13ff66/tumblr_m96lls57wz1qdlh1io1_r1_400.gif) all the time.  *"Okay, okay, we don't care, how do we win this contest?" -- you, probably*  *sigh* Fiiiine, I'll get to the rules. Party pooper.  1. United States only. [(Sorry, Canada.)](http://ioneglobalgrind.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/41806-emma-stone-are-you-crying-gif-71rm.gif?w=600&h=335) 2. You have to be following the rules to the subreddit. Yes, those, over there. ----> 3. If you win, **you must verify with the verification system under [subreddit Rule 4](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/).** If you don't, I'll have no choice but to move to the next-best entry! 4. Once I decide the winner (at or around **5pm EDT today**), you'll have **one hour** to respond to my PM before I move to the next-best entry. (*"But why one hour? That's so not cool, what if I'm doing something between 5-6pm?!"* Hey, if you're jonesing for pizza today/tonight, it'd be nice to be able to get it for dinner, y'know?) 5. After I PM the winner and get verification, we'll go over the necessary information for getting your award to you. 6. **Only top-level replies to this post will count as entries.** Replies to top-level posts won't be considered. Feel free to comment on others' entries, but please, no vote brigading! 7. To enter, answer the following question: **What is the *best* birthday present you have ever received?** It can be because of monetary value, sentimental value, its coincidence with a significant life event, whatever -- just tell me *why* it was the best! **(Wanna make your entry even better? Show proof of the gift!)**  Remember, the winner will be chosen based on my [totally never wrong](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Yeah-Sure-Okay.gif) personal opinion, so make your entry a good one! Really sit down and give it a good think.	1410352910.0
t3_2fpm3e	1410088454.0	Franklyidontgivearip	PIF	[Request] Today is our daughters 2 month birthday... and we're with her in the hospital.	I'm not exactly sure where to start.  I've never done this before, yet I subscribe to the subreddit and enjoy watching the kindness flow from sender to receiver.  I always wanted to be able to be on the giving end, but that hasn't happened yet.  Unfortunately, now I'm asking to be on the receiving end.  My daughter is 2 months old today (9/7/14).  She's spending said 2 month birthday in the hospital.  She won't stop vomiting.  She can't keep anything down- not even pedialyte. They don't know why.  She was given an antibiotic for an ear infection two Fridays ago and since starting (and subsequently finishing) the course, has gone from happy baby with possible reflux to being constantly fussy, unable to be calmed down, and unable to eat anything and keep it down.  They have checked her for [pyloric stenosis](http://m.kidshealth.org/parent/medical/digestive/pyloric_stenosis.html), [gastroparesis](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastroparesis), peptic ulcers, penicillin and milk protein allergies... so far, nothing has shown up.   Her daddy and I are responsible for our own food while we are here.  We have $0.18 in the bank, no cash, and no credit card.  We do not qualify for government assistance (WIC or food stamps), because my husband works full time (for a fortune 500 company's fulfillment center that shall not be named-- after a South American forest ahem) and makes too much pretax income.  He gets paid on Friday the 12th.    I'm semi rambling, sorry.    It's 7 am EST, and since we got here at 8 pm last night, we've had nothing but free coffee and free hot chocolate out of the vending machine in the ER downstairs.  We came on empty bellies, running on the adrenaline fumes of no sleep and frazzled nerves.    My husband is asleep now so I can rest later.  I'm holding my daughter in my arms praying that when they try to feed her this afternoon she can keep it down and we might can go home... or we figure out what is wrong and what to do to fix it.    We would love a pizza for lunch.  I'm not sure who is nearby that he could go pick up (probably Domino's or Papa Johns) but I can ask the nurses.  If you could help us with lunch, we'd gladly pay it forward or return the favor on payday.  [Proof](http://imgur.com/a/VaLhF)    Thank you in advance.   EDIT:  They've tried giving her more pedialyte and she's thrown it up as well.  We've been told that we're not allowed to leave until they figure this out.  They're going to evaluate her for bowel obstruction and twisted bowels.  This means she has to swallow a mixture with some sort of "marker" in it that is visible in xrays.  They will xray her abdomen every so often to see if the markers are passing through correctly.    EDIT 2:  We've had about 5 offers for pizza, but with all the coming and going in and out of the room for tests and stopping to listen to nurses and doctors, nothing has been confirmed.  They gave me a "pumpers plate," a tray of food for mothers that are breastfeeding or pumping.  My husband and I split it.  Well... actually, he wanted me to eat it by myself but I wouldn't and he only took the slice of chocolate cake.  [He's a good Daddy.](http://imgur.com/G0aOTBH)  EDIT 3: My husband is /u/imanamazombie.  He wants to comment on the thread.  EDIT 4: We've been given a gift card.  Thank you to all who wished to donate and couldn't or those who planned on donating but we couldn't get coordinated enough at the same time.  We have been told we will be here until tomorrow and a lot of people are sending me PMs wanting us to keep updating... If the mods are ok with that, I can continue to update.  EDIT 5:  As much as I hate pictures of myself, my husband is forcing me to do [this](http://imgur.com/lKem6NK.)  Lillie is awake and very grumpy- and hungry!  They want her to be able to keep down 4 ounces of pedialyte for at least 4 hours before we can move back to milk.  We've got our fingers crossed!  As for the pediatric gastroenterologist, we will see him tomorrow.   EDIT 6:  A nurse finally saw what our daughter was doing firsthand,  as opposed to us just describing it.  She freaked out an immediately yelled, "Oh my God, that is NOT normal."  She grabbed her phone and took a bunch of "after" photos and ran away to call the on call doctor.  :-(  EDIT 7:  Well, as my husband said a bit earlier, Miss Lillie had an upper GI that revealed severe reflux and motility issues.  They are going to start stool sample tests for protein allergies and test for absorption issues.  We're going to see a second gastroenterologist, an ENT, a lactation consultant, and a nutritionist.  We're going to be here for a few more days.  Yucky.  EDIT 8: We're still here.  It's Tuesday at 10:42 AM.  She's back on zantac and prevacid but still only allowed pedialyte and they've added probiotics to it twice a day.  They're going to slowly add milk until she can tolerate it.  We had an [IV blowout](http://imgur.com/0qEaX44) around 1 am when she accidentally jerked her IV out.  She scared Daddy so bad thatE when he jumped up with her in his arms her socks blew off.  We're working towards 4 ounces of formula or milk staying down 4 hours.  Keep praying!  EDIT 9:  I'm thinking of starting a caringbridge.  Anyone interested?  Although I have no idea if anyone is still reading this....    EDIT 10:  I will no longer update through reddit.  I don't want to keep others in need from receiving help.  If you are still reading this and want to know about Lillie,  I've created a [CaringBridge site](http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/lillieepting) to update those who wish to follow her story.  The last i will say is that the 4 pedialyte to 1 milk ration isn't working.  She hasn't tolerated any milk today.  In fact, she vomited all over me and then her nurse after only half a feeding.  The nurse notified her pediatrician.  There's talk of an [NG tube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasogastric_intubation) for feedings.    I'm crumbling.   (FINAL FINAL) EDIT 11:  WE WENT HOME FRIDAY AT 1 PM ET!!  	1410629840.0

Well, I did the deal and got the code, but you can't use the code for delivery without racking up $12 worth of food first, so it's pointless to me (I can't get there myself today).  It expires today, so if anybody wants a free pizza code, I think it only works once, I'll check back in 20 minutes, print out the names, and draw from a hat.  You have to order online, I believe.

As a man with a vegetarian wife, being at work late today provides a rare opportunity to thoroughly enjoy a pizza made from something with parents. The only problem? No money.  Be a bro (or ladybro) and send me a pie in honor of Jennifer Lawrence's  recently exposed pie.  Edit: KalN7 Pizza'd me!	1409775684.0
t3_2f2l9h	1409475423.0	nomimasenka	shroom	[Request] Just graduated college in Japan. No job. Want a crazy Japanese pizza.	I have two more interviews.  I need pizza crust and pepperoni juice power to do good.  Also mayonnaise (this is Dominos Japan after all). Also yesterday was the last day of my part-time job (because they are closing to remodel and hire all-new staff), so I won't have the money to indulge in a pizza this month.   If you can't read Japanese, I know at least the Dominoes site has both an English and Japanese version:  JP: http://www.dominos.jp  EN: http://www.dominos.jp/eng/  1 yen = 0.01 USD roughly.  And I request you make me eat the craziest pizza they have.  As much corn/mayo/salmon/whatever as you like.  If you do this for me, once I get my last scholarship money I will pay you back in pizza form.  C'mon guys, you know you wanna make me eat a:  [MAYO JAGA PIZZA](http://www.dominos.jp/image/shared/itemimgsl/97.jpg)  or a  [GORYEO GALBI PIZZA](http://www.dominos.jp/image/shared/itemimgsl/184.jpg)  or a  [BBQ GARLIC CHICKEN PIZZA](http://www.dominos.jp/image/shared/itemimgsl/185.jpg)	1409476063.0
t3_2ez8u7	1409369795.0	zymish	shroom	Low on food, and I can't access my money until next week. [Request]	I get paid via PayPal (self-employed) and it takes forever to transfer that money to my bank account where I can actually use it. All I've got in the fridge is condiments and pasta sauce. I've got Soylent but it'd be nice to eat something with some substance as I've been consuming nothing but Soylent for days now. I'm not going to starve, but I could really go for a pizza and a Coke.  It'll take a while (my bank account is in the red, had to cancel first-world joys like Netflix and Spotify so they'd stop slamming me with overdraft fees), but I absolutely will pay back - or forward, your preference - when I can.  Edit: [Pizza received](http://i.imgur.com/uPa9vAW.jpg). Thank you, /u/ifuckingdiditagain! You fucking did it again!	1409427852.0

t3_2epviy	1409141458.0	Reorn	shroom	Being evicted, last day before homeless, could use a veggie pizza.	Until recently I wasn't aware that I was shadow banned from reddit for posting on that dark knight rises thread awhile back, not sure if anyone remembers. Well, unbeknownst to me, it was a raid by (my best guess) 4chan or somebody, and I also posted "So you guys hear about that dark knight rises?" because EVERYONE was posting it! I didn't get the news apparently. So here I am, posting on reddit for months, thinking I'm just some unfunny loser who never gets le karma, ... and then a moderator informs me.  Anyways, I'm trying to find an apartment but it's hard when all the background checks shit on any chance in hell. I have enough money for a month of rent, barely, so hopefully I can find someone seeking a roommate soon. I'm shaking here, forgot to eat anything all day, just jamming on my computer to find a room for tomorrow.   I'm a vegetarian so if anyone has a heart, please don't troll me with pepperoni. If not, it's okay, I'll manage. I know there are more deserving people out there with kids. I can eat tomato soup, or canned corn today. ._.	1409146077.0

t3_2dk2n4	1408037548.0	dclrtdiaz	shroom	[Request] My best friend and I are having a bad day.	I'm helping my friend move in to her apartment in Austin, and it isn't going well. First she didn't have power for the first few days we got her. Second, her school WiFi was locked because of a computer virus and it can't get unlocked until she wipes her computer. Third, when we called AT&T to schedule an appointment to get WiFi and cable put in, they kept hanging up on us and we couldn't get an appointment. Her roommate finally got an appointment, which is today, and the internet isn't working. Finally, her toilet sprung a leak and flooded her bathroom. We cleaned up the mess, but now she doesn't have a working toilet and won't be able to get it fixed until Saturday. She is pretty upset, and some free pizza would really lift our spirits and make us feel better about this horrible week.	1408055016.0

t3_2dgap8	1407949155.0	sasslyn	shroom	[Request][Canada] Car wrecked, pelvis wrecked, bank account wrecked...	Hey guys! I've tried requesting pizza in the past but it never came to fruition. I thought I would give it a try again today because as of yesterday, everything is just a huge whirlwind of crap that I now have to deal with.  I got t-boned yesterday coming out of a parking lot and my beautiful baby 1990 Honda Civic was entirely destroyed, along with my pelvis. Unfortunately because I am a new hire at work, my benefits don't kick in until after probation and I am not eligible for short-term disability payments so I won't be getting paid while I'm out of work. My car now has to be sold for $300 which will barely cover the fees for storage and towing. :(   It's just been an all-around crummy situation and I feel bad for my mom having to come back from her vacation in order to take care of me. I'd love it if we were able to all sit down together and enjoy a pizza in spite of all the chaos.  I know there is a huge debate on this sub about whether or not the random acts of pizza-giving should actually be RANDOM, but if any one is able to help me out at all, I would super greatly appreciate it!

There still could be some cells left, and I have an appointment with a neuro-oncologist through the Baylor Cancer Center in about a week to check on that. The tumor will be something I have to deal with for the rest of my life. They're always a risk to grow back.  I've been having to deal with my university to try and get some grades removed from my record. The tumor seriously affected my mental acuity last semester which caused me to fail a few classes.   I'm already tired but having to deal with them has made me exhausted. I'm also a little scared that the tumor was fully taken out and there were a few small cells that are growing back.  I haven't worked in a few weeks, and I'm trying to pinch pennies. Anyway, a pizza that I don't have to make myself would be a godsend.  Here's the sucker that was operated on: http://i.imgur.com/SCPhveQ.png  Edit: I live just outside of Dallas by the way.	1407613089.0

My little brother doesn't have any money either. We live in Minneapolis, MN. I'm just very ready for this week to end.  I apologize for the sloppy formatting - I'm on mobile. Our internet shut off yesterday so I'm hoping that my phones LTE connection will be fine. Even without food I try to find the good in every situation - I have a phone. A lot of people don't. I think there is always something to be happy about no matter how hard it may get.  This is my first post on here, I hope I'm including all of the right information.  As soon as I have enough money to feed myself and my family I will pay it foward and buy a pizza for another family or individual.  Thank you so much. This is such a kind subreddit.	1407339629.0

t3_2cmatl	1407182679.0	buttsarefunny	shroom	[Request] (TX) We're spending the afternoon at the beach and I would rather not cook tonight...even if we could afford it.	Edit: We've decided to go out for dinner tonight, so this request is pointless. Give it to someone else who doesn't have a dinner date :)  I also miss this sub! I hope to get back into pizza-gifting once I get a job again. Figured I'd try out a request to start.  So it's pretty straightforward...I'm at the beach with my husband and his family all day today. We are already exhausted, and we're not even leaving yet. Then an hour drive home, and not much in the fridge...we don't really want to cook. We won't starve, there's sandwich stuff, but pizza would be a fun little treat! It's just the two of us, his family goes to bed super early and we usually cook for ourselves in the evening. Just not tonight.  So if you wanted to help out, feel free! I'm not going to make some BS promise about how I'll pass it on within a month or something, but the intent is there. Just not the paycheck, yet. Yay job hunting!  Edit: In case anyone wants proof, there's no username because we already left but here's us from a couple hours ago!

After a quick scroll through some posts on RAoP, I've noticed that a lot of people don't mention where they are in the world.

If someone offers a pizza, then when the user is chosen, deletes their post and their account, something must be wrong right?   I've not had much experience on here and I'm a little concerned about this. It may be nothing, I'm probably worrying over nothing, I'd just like to hear some more experienced users opinions on this.   EDIT: Reading the responses of you lot on here has made my year. I will stick around and /u/throweroftamtrums, you are a god among men.   Thanks a lot guys.   slaughter88  	1407073861.0

(I'd love for this to be a monthly thing, but college will begin late August, and I won't have as much of  an income).   The rules are simple: 1) Make me laugh 2) Make the humor loosely or tightly related to August. 3) I will choose a winner on August 8th at 12am  You can crack a joke about Romans, since the month was name after Caesar Augustus.   You can make  an "okay" joke because of August-us Waters (The Fault in our Stars).   You can make a seasonal joke about August.   Anything related to August is fair game, though if I can't see the link between the joke and August, I might ask you to add a source or explanation.   As a side note, I enjoy original satire and longer posts. Posts can be pictures, texts, videos.  In conclusion: Be August, be August! Put this challenge to the test!

I have a "Crew Rally" at my min wage fast food job tonight from 4-5 so I will choose a winner when I get home from that :)   Note: Please don't PM me with your personal sob stories, all that will do is immediately disqualify you from the contest.

t3_2buc9d	1406443675.0	thekingearl	FAP	[OFFER - CONTEST] $50 you call it girt certificate to the first person to solve the cryptogram inside.	**EDIT 2 -  newzealander won the contest solving it in spite of my drunken typos. Thanks everyone for playing.**  **EDIT - We have a winner. And as predicated I made mistakes. Don't drink and cipher, but at least I predicted my mistakes.**  Below is a simple [substitution cipher cryptogram] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram). I.e. each letter of the alphabet represents another letter. The first person to post the correct solution will win a $50 gift card to the pizza place of their choice.  **The rules.**  1. First person to post the correct answer wins.   2. Please do not edit posts. In the event there is more the one correct response when I check for a winner I will sort by oldest post to determine the winner. Edited posts makes more work / potential confusion for me so all edited posts will be disregarded. You are welcome to change your answer, just please delete your old post and make a new one rather than editing.  3. I have tried my best to double check myself for accuracy. I'm not perfect. If I made a typo or mistake when ciphering that you can catch and still solve the puzzle you get an extra $10.   4. Using a computer program is cheating. Numerous computer programs could quickly solve any simple cipher near instantly. Of course I have no way of knowing if you are using one or not, but on your integrity if you have one please refrain from using it and let everyone play the way the game is intended.   5. I will check back approximately 24 hours from now to see if I have a winner. If so the contest is over. If not I will give a "clue" (i.e. identify one letter). I will continue that habit until someone wins.   6. When someone has won I will edit this post to state that a winner has been declared and the contest over. I will then PM the winner. Once the winner claims their prize I will publicly identify the winner and the correct solution to the cipher (to avoid unscrupulous persons from trying to impersonate the winner IAW this sub's guidelines).   7. You may of course collaborate all you want, but I will award the prize only to the person who posts the right answer. Any deals you make with anyone else to split a prize in a joint effort are on your own.  8. The mods may make any amendments / additions to the rules.  9. The prize is a $50 e-gift card tot he pizza place of your choice. Since I live in the U.S. (Hawaii) I'm generally thinking "Big 3" Pizza Hut / Papa John's / Domino's since I know I can buy you a gift card online and have it sent to you email. But if you live elsewhere, want a different place etc you can have it to wherever you want as long as I can fairly easily buy you a gift card online.   10. Good luck and thanks for playing.  **The Cipher to solve:**  I have attempted to use words that are solvable (i.e double letters, etc). There is no starting "give away" letter, but your clue is the solution answers the following: *Tell me something about yourself.*  Here's the cipher -  **R CSWK WTUVK JA BEUU KRME WIFXRVH D NEATKIHEAJ KI KEA KI ZRV BRBKA PIFFDEW ZIEKQ IB BEUU TROOD. URKQUE R EUDFFA FRYU TROOD, IE R DJ D HRHDVKRN VUEP. TDA JU, KQUYRVHUDEF.**  **Information irrelevent to winning:**  *Why are you doing this?*  I have run contests in the past and had fun. Sometimes I low stakes gamble with my friends. When I win I consider it "found money" since I make a good living already. Hosting online pizza contests is fun, and I like to think that when someone wins them it brightens their day as a small victory, just as my low stakes gambling wins do for me.  *Why $50?*  'Cause I won like a hundy playing golf today. As I said, it makes someone else happy, I have fun running the contest with found money, etc. Plus I figured I probably wouldn't put the effort in to solve the puzzle for a free one topping, but I might for fifty bucks. I like to have big enough prizes that people play my contests. But splitting my golf winnings with you isn't going to change my financial situation at all.  *Why a cryptogram?*  No reason. I've done best picture, scavenger hunt, and stuff in the past. I just wanted to do something different. I figured solve a cipher was something everyone could play, and lots of people enjoy the puzzle game anyways even if there's no free pizza to be had.  *But you admitted that someone could cheat and win with a computer program?*  They sure could. So that's why I called it out. This is supposed to be a fun contest, so hopefully by asking that no one "cheat" to get my pizza giveaway people will be on their integrity and respect that I'm just some anonymous guy giving something away for fun. Let's be honest, a free $50 worth of anything is nice to all of us. But it's not going to change the vast majority of our lives in any significant way. I figure if someone does "cheat" after I've asked them not to they must be really motivated for free pizza, so they might actually really need a couple free meals. I guess I'm okay with someone cheating if they're really in need. Otherwise, I put faith in inherent honesty in humanity.  *You wrote a lot here. Thanks for the wall of text, asshole.*  I told you, I was drinking and golfing with my friends. Drunk typing is a thing. Thanks for reading & good luck!	1406872856.0

So anyways, I'll give away 2 random egift cards to one of the us big 3.  To enter, draw a picture of a redditor celebrating his cake day.  Digital or hand drawn, doesn't need to be good (contest is NOT judged on quality, it's random).  It does need to show at least a few minutes worth of effort (not just a stock picture) -- that's the point of the requirement (to avoid spamming entries).  That means new accounts are fine on this offer (but still no multiple accounts per person).   for the rambling, I'm on my phone.  I'll do the random draw around 11pm est today 7/24  **Edit:** Contest over.  There were so many good entries (20 in total), I wish I could afford to get you all pizza!

Thanks for playing folks, but the dice have chosen and I am contacting them as we speak.  ---- Mods do a tough job, and it often goes under-appreciated.  We don't get compensated and many of us have to deal with the worst reddit has to offer on a daily basis.  Well, **not today!**  I'm going to be giving away some pizza to a lucky mod.  What are the rules?  1.  You must moderate at least 1 subreddit with a total of 30,000 subscribers.   2.  You must have been a moderator on that subreddit for at least a month.  3.  **You must include an 'interesting' story from your time moderating that subreddit.**  It doesn't have to be anything intricate or long, but if it's not there *you're not gonna win anything,* so wrack your brains and do your best.  4.  Your Pizza Place o' Choice  I live in the US, and I will do my best to make sure that the winner receives their compensation regardless of where they live, but I can't 100% guarantee that if you live outside the US I will be able to deliver.  A winner will be randomly selected sometime on Friday.  My fellow /r/changemyview mods are going to be unable to enter.  Bias and all that ;)	1406321796.0

t3_2b05tn	1405643180.0	dotAlexX	shroom	[REQUEST] Lost my job again...	I was unemployed 2 months ago and got re-employed finally was able to pay off my dues from being unemployed a couple of months but problems arised at the new job.  I signed a waiver where I worked that said if there's any damages to something that I would have to pay for it. There was an accident but I resolved it with the customer and paid the difference which was only like $20. Go figure the part I bought was defective. So we had to buy another. My boss still wanted me to pay him $150 on top of keeping the $125 the customer paid. That's abuse and unfair. Especially when you're getting paid chump change living pay check to pay check. I had all the right to quit and go elsewhere to make a living.  Now I only have a few hundred dollars saved up, I won't be getting a pay check because my boss says he'll just take the money out of that and I have to stretch what little I have on top of bills that are due.  If anyone can help me out it'd be appreciated. Thank you.  Here is proof of the waiver and my story: http://i.imgur.com/f7fHDFI.jpg	1405643511.0

t3_2ahrk0	1405145495.0	plastic_apollo	FAP	Last year, I gave away pizza in return for your help for a Photoshop birthday surprise. I'd like to make it a tradition - details (and goofy dog pics) inside.	Last year, you all had me in absolute tears from laughter with [this magnificent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1hil2c/offeryou_want_a_pizza_i_need_photoshop_skills_for/). You all came through for me in a BIG way, and I was able to make a "Three Eskie Moon" T-shirt for my fiance (and later this year...husband!).   I need your help again.  **Background:** This is our two-year-old American Eskimo dog, Albus. We...love him for who he is. There are 'Alpha' dogs, and then there are WILLFULL TERRORS OF FLUFF. He keeps us laughing. And sobbing. Mostly laughing, though.  **The request**: For those of you who don't know, American Eskimo dogs are neither American nor Eskimos...they were originally called the German Spitz and were very popular with American troops over in Europe. They were brought back to the US and bred by a couple at a place known as the Eskimo kennel, and when WWII tensions picked up, the 'German' fell by the way side, replaced with 'American.'  As a result, we have a running joke about when our dog 'got to the states.' "Oh, Albus, he's from Germany....he arrived here in 1945...nothing suspicious about that..." Or, we'll joke about his cousins 'Maria' and 'Fernando' down in Argentina, where his family is from...circa 1944... We decided years ago that our gecko (who we've had for 8 years!) is Jewish, and as a result, "we can't understand why the dog and him don't get along."  You get the joke.   Well, the joke escalated about six months ago when we found a historic photograph of, *I kid you not*, a Nazi soldier with his American Eskimo dog. I can't even make that up. I know the subject is a bit insensitive, but we did have a good laugh.  **So, here's where you come in:**  [Here is a link](http://imgur.com/a/491CU) to various goofy poses our dog is in (with plenty of .jpg - sorry for the brick quality, but hopefully that won't matter...I'll explain in a second). My personal favorite is the 4th pic of just his head peeking around the wall.  What I'd like you to do is photoshop my dog into situations involving various historical situations/disasters...and *I can't believe I'm saying this*, and I'm *so, so sorry*, but....a few WWII stuff, *if you know what I mean*, would be especially funny. **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE** don't take that to an extreme and put my dog next to piles of corpses or **anything** having to do with extermination/concentration camps - I want this to be light-hearted and give him a good laugh on his birthday, so instead think the background of a Nazi cocktail party or something.  Alternatively, historical disasters work perfectly fine, too. I'm hoping the poor quality of the pictures won't matter since he'll be getting photoshopped into mostly black and white images.   I'll award a tasty pizza from your choice of the Big 3 (Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Papa John's) to whoever makes me laugh the hardest by **Saturday evening, June 12, 6 p.m.** US only!   Thank you for helping us laugh again this year. Looking forward to your submissions!   **Edit: A winner has been chosen :)**	1405203973.0

t3_2afoi9	1405094993.0	KunSeii	FAP	[Contest] Buffalo, Booze, and Buddies (NJ)	Hey everyone. I'm sure anyone who is here would agree with me that there are few pleasure in life greater than kicking back with a few friends and enjoying a slice with a couple cold ones.  Some of the best times of my life have been had over pizza, and that continues to this day. I always tell people that one of the things I love about my job is that, by coincidence, my dad works right down the street, so we get to have lunch together every day.  We've been going to the same pizza place for years, and early on we discovered they have the best buffalo chicken pizza on the planet. I've taken friends there, and every one has agreed with me.  Hell, I've thrown parties and driven from Mahwah to Whippany to get pizza for it.  This is such a great place, and I've decided I want to give back, and here's how:  I will hand deliver (Yes that's right. To increase the potential eligible participants) the following to 1 lucky winner:  -One Large Pie of the best Buffalo Chicken Pizza in the world.   -One 6 pack of beer (Your choice or I will surprise you) If winner is over 21.   Eligibility Requirements:   **-Live within driving distance**  My daily commute takes me up and down 287. If you live between exits 39 and 59 or close enough, then you're probably within distance. I'm not trying to shut people out, but I doubt anyone will want pizza that arrives several hours later and cold. PM me if you want me to let you know if you're close enough.  **-Have an account older than 60 days**  **-Be active on a sub other than a RA sub**  **-Be prepared to show ID if you want the beer**  **-Be available on the date to receive the pizza**  If you fit the criteria, post whether you prefer blue cheese or ranch on your buffalo chicken pizza, and tell me your best story involving pizza with your buddies.  One random winner will be chosen at midnight EST on Thursday, July 17th. The pizza will arrive Friday, July 18th around or after 6 pm EST.  Best of luck!  P.S. Delivery date is not set in stone. If you will be out of town that day and you win, just let me know. We'll work out another day.  **UPDATE:** I spoke with the owner today, and they do have gift certificates.  So I'm prepared to offer two alternatives for those who might live too far for the delivery.  1. I will give you a gift certificate good for one buffalo chicken pizza. Pick it up whenever you can get there.  2. I will meet you at the pizza place myself where I will buy the pie for your group (lunch or dinner) and pick up the six after.  After speaking with the mods, I'm going to be keeping the name of the pizza place secret until a winner is selected, however I will say that it's in Morris county, Whippany area, within 5 miles of Rt. 10.  **UPDATE 2:** Winner chosen!   http://i.imgur.com/hGbG4KB.jpg  Congratulations to /u/squigi on winning this contest.  You've earned yourself a six pack of beer (provided you're over 21) and a large Buffalo Chicken from Pronto Pizza in Cedar Knolls (Formerly Ridgedale Pizza) PM me your details along with which of the three options you would most prefer.	1405659841.0

t3_2a3iij	1404777751.0	Whisperers	Whisperers	[Offer] $15 Gift Card to one of the big 3	**This offer ONLY applies to people who have made 'Thank You' posts on THIS sub.**  So if you haven't then please do not comment.  The reason for doing this again is to hopefully encourage people to make 'Thank You' posts. (As i will be doing this again). After all, if someone is quick enough to post a Request post, then the very least they should do is make a 'Thank You' post if their request was fullfilled. All you need to do to enter is to post the link to your 'Thank You' post here in the comments and i will randomly choose someone 24 hours from now. I will then message them to see which of the big 3 pizza chains they would like their $15 Gift Card for :)  **US ONLY SORRY**  **EDIT: CONTEST CLOSED** I chose /u/mickguinness and have messaged them asking which of the big 3 they would like their gift card for. (I will be doing this again sometime soon, so please do make Thank You posts if someone gifts you. Not just because of offers like this but kindness works both ways)	1404864854.0

t3_29a5mo	1403911227.0	mastergrumpus	pizza	[Meta] The Perspective of a Pizza Giver	Hey, /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza!  I have been having a hard time recently finding someone to give a pizza to.  It's not that there aren't people posting or in need, but as some one blessed with a steady income that can cover the rent, when I buy someone a pizza here, I'd like it to be fun!  I have come over here several times to sift through the past few hours of requests, only to leave the sub uninterested in buying anyone a pizza.  Why is this?  Don't you feel nice after helping out a stranger in need?  Of course I do!  That's why I'll stop into a shop to buy a homeless person a bottle of water or a sandwich or volunteer time.  BUT, the reason I come to this sub is slightly different.  The point, name, and previous state of the sub is Random.  The reason I buy someone a pizza here is also because Reddit allows for funny, random things to happen and this is a great place to for that.  I get that the sub has become more focused on helping those in need, and for the most part that's great.  But, as stated in the sidebar, "...we are not a substitute for r/foodpantry or r/assistance".  If I had wanted to simply help someone in need with a bit of money or food, I'd be on there right now and not here trying (and failing) to find a Request that embodies the spirit of the sub.  **PLEASE try and make this sub just as great for Offerers as it is for Requesters!**  The general repetition of depressing stories (starving college student, down to my last can of beans, account is negative, someone close or a pet died, etc.) has chased me away several times when I was more than willing to give someone a pizza.  I've given about 10 pies at this point, but [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1mv2uy/offer_a_random_act_of_pizza/) was my favorite post, and the one I thought best exemplified what I first found fun about the sub.  [Pizza on, Reddit!](http://waltzofthesaltz.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/ch860927.gif?w=450&h=142)  Edit: **TL;DR:** If you are requesting a pizza, try and make it fun!!!  Offer to stand on your head or turn your shirt inside-out!  Most of us aren't looking to gain something of equal value (gift card, drawing, etc.), just to see someone out there do something silly.	1403915753.0

At the moment, I don't have a ride to work, and if I did, I would still have to find someone to pick me up from a town away at midnight.  So unless I can find someone I'm losing a day of work, and I have no food here, nor do I have the money to get food for delivery.  I've been strapped for cash the past two weeks, and now I have to replace my window.  I'm still waiting to hear back from the insurance company to find out how much I owe to fix this random act of violence.  I'll post proof in a few minutes once my phone uploads the pictures to imgur  If I could just get a pizza, or even just some chinese food or anything really delivered to me, that would be fantastic.

t3_28n7s1	1403275697.0	BIGMc_LARGEHUGE	FAP	[Request] Vet Bill was way higher than expected, could use a pizza for dinner tonight.	So I rescued my best friend Dubs a little over a year ago and he's been great. He's 6 and a half which is old for a boxer/mastiff.  Last week I noticed he wasn't really using his back left leg a lot so I took him to the vet. I was expecting.g it to be in the 150-200 range, but it was more than double that and it nearly wiped out my whole check. He has arthritis and he's starting to get hip dysplasia. My dad mailed me a check this morning to help me out that will hopefully get here tomorrow, so a pizza for dinner would really help. The closest is Papa John's. I appreciate all of you for even reading and/or considering to help me.  Here is proof. Pic of the vet Bill plus a few of my old man. Thank you everyone  http://imgur.com/a/MEY8E  EDIT-Request more than fulfilled. Thank you guys I'm so humbled right now. Thank you thread to come soon with more pup pics	1403297889.0

I'm not a superstitious guy, but Murphys Law went nuts today. Work was a nightmare, our payroll is late so I'm without my paycheck and I got the final decision from the credit union that I won't be reimbursed for my stolen money (and the cops are worthless).   I've decided to just veg out on the couch and watch some of the Friday the 13th movies playing on tv, and pizza would make this experience a game changer for my shit day.   If anyone could, I will repay you with a spooky glitched out version of a photo of your choosing. It's not much, but they turn out cool.   Thank you, should anyone save the day!

Earlier this week I posted on here needing help. I had trouble eating that night because my paycheck was overdue and I had to spend extra money to work for gas fees. Payday finally has come in, and I had some cash returned to me.  Now I want to return the favor, unfortunately my job isn't well paying so I can't send everyone a pie.

I was the guy who hosted the [pizza party scavenger hunt](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/279tw8/offer_contest_lets_play_pizza_party_scavenger/) but said I'd declare a winner Sunday night. My life got in the way and I didn't declare a winner until just now (winner has been PMed but not publicly declared until they claim). As such I owe reddit a penance for being late (I can afford it..I'm doing okay in life). So here's a follow up scavenger hunt: **The hardest item to find in the original was a TMNT3 on VHS.** Since pizza is appropriate for TMNT fans I will give a $50 to the first person to post a picture of a slip of paper with their user name next to a collection of all three 90s TMNT movies (in any format...VHS/DVD/whatever) as well as action figures of all four turtles plus Shredder, plus Krang, plus Splinter. Any edition (new or old) of the action figures is okay. Can be new or from our childhood.   **Rules** Post a picture of a slip of paper next to your movies and action figures and you win if you're the first in. See rules from my previous contest for details (read: no photoshopping).  **EDIT 1** I'll accept a screenshot of a digi copy of the movies since this is otherwise impossible for anyone other than a freak fanatic as far as I'm concerned.  **EDIT 2** I don't care if you actually own the figures. if you wanna go to the store and snap a pic of the figures on the shelf and pair with your digi of the movies go for it.**  **EDIT 3: u/tizzytenderloin has claimed his prize. We're working the details of what pizza place he prefers!**	1402645704.0

t3_27u7yj	1402449908.0	isothien	pizza-gold	[REQUEST] 7 hr police standoff at apartments today, didn't get to wash dishes or defrost meat for dinner	Today was a CRAZY day... there was a 7 hour long police standoff at the apartment across from mine, which blocked access to my entire street. I usually come home for lunch and take care of dishes and defrosting my meat but I couldn't do that today (the cats also went without their lunch) because there were gunshots when I approached. Fun times.  Husband comes home in an hour... we literally are out of money to spend on anything but necessary groceries. We don't have much in the way of dinners that don't require defrosted meat sadly. Would love a pizza for dinner tonight.

I had to drive down 300 miles to do a task, which ate up a lot of my money and my company still hasn't paid me back. Today, I had to run and pick up pastries for a board meeting, but will only be paid back Friday. My boss is looking for any reason to fire employees, and as someone who isn't a high priority I have to really watch my feet.  I'm going to sell some stuff on e-bay when I get home tonight to try and make rent, and all I have left to eat is garlic (which I will probably cook up, to be honest). I would be ever grateful to come home to a pizza.   Los Angeles, California.   Edit*: changed 'lay off' to 'fire'. Thanks Illusions_not_Tricks!  Update* Its here!!! Picture right here.

t3_27navl	1402263692.0	DiDsyrup	shroom	[Request] (repost forgot tag) My day has been both very lucky and very unlucky.	Sorry for repost. I forgot the tag.   I woke up this morning to the sound of my power zapping off. I called my bank and luckily I had just enough money to turn it back on. I was left with $84 in my checking account after I payed my over-due power bill.   I went to a friends house to take a shower before the power guy came to my apartment to turn the power back on. On my way home from my shower, I ran over a diamond plate in the road that popped my right passenger tire. Yay. I have no idea what a diamond plate is but the tow truck guy said he saw it on his way to get my car. Luckily a tire/parts shop near my apartment had a tire that matched my others and they are changing/replacing it for $80 today. Whoohoo! My insurance covered the tow. So here I sit. Left with $4 and an empty fridge that I planned to fill today. I dont get paid until wednesday so a pizza would hold me over perfectly until then. Also I plan to use the $4 for gas to get to work tomorrow...  Help a poor sad college student out. It would turn my day around.    EDIT: Received! /u/SkywolfBloodraven You the bomb! Best pizza I've ever eaten. I will not forget this day.	1402278526.0

t3_27kr97	1402177767.0	protipkillyourself	shroom	[Request] Want to hear a joke about pizza? Never mind, it's too cheesy.	EDIT #1: Matchakitkat just sent me a $25 gift card which will feed me multiple times over the next two weeks. I can't say how grateful and thankful I am. Here is a screen shot in case the mods like proof. http://i.imgur.com/dGkGaGT.jpg  Lol, thanks for opening my post. I'm a 23 year old single male living alone in Huntington WV. I've recently started a direct door to door sales position to try and make ends meet. The job definitely puts me out of my comfort zone, and tests me daily, but I am happy for the opportunity and trying my best.  The problem lies in the way in which we're paid. The job is solely commission based, and you aren't paid until a week after the customer is installed with the service we provide. From the moment I'm on a customers door step to the date we agree to have them installed (which can be up to 4 weeks out, depending on their schedule) and the date they get installed, there is a time frame in which I'm not earning money.  The way in which it was explained to me is after you've been on the job for a few weeks, you'll start generating enough clientele that your paychecks steady out and become consistent.  The paychecks have honestly been pretty sporadic these first couple of weeks. One week I got nice/solid $200, and the next only $50.  Long story short rent was due on the first of this month and I was about twenty dollars shy, thinking everything will be alright. I'll just pay it a little late on the 6th when I get paid, and will also buy some groceries to last me until next Friday (we are paid weekly).  Well yesterday was pay day and I woke up to have received $0.00. I called my manager and he said I had no install dates happen that fell during this pay period.  I was able to borrow the $20 difference for rent, but I am left without any money for food or even for gas getting to and from this new job until next Friday. I just keep looking at my bank account that literally has change in it and don't know what to do.  There are several large pizza chains in my city, the closest being Papa Johns off of Hal Greer which is about 1.0 miles from my apartment. Even a small size pizza will fill me up, I can get full off of 2 slices. I can and have made a large last 3-4 days. If anyone is looking to help someone out in need I would definitely appreciate any help I could get and I would absolutely remember it and try to pass it forward one day when I am back on my feet.  Thanks for taking the time to read, and have a good day everyone!  PS: Will post pics of me devouring a slice if sender requests!	1402205408.0

t3_27hxkd	1402085783.0	FiraNayshun	shroom	[Request] My college messed up my financial aid situation and my girlfriend and I are down on our luck.	Edit: Thank you /u/mass_merde! For the pizza :D I'll definitely pay it forward when my situation clears up!   Not to make it sound like a sob story, but my girlfriend and I live in Gainesville, FL and we are down on our last dollar. I attend UF and she just graduated with her A.A.  Some background info: I (20) attend UF, but currently I am not registered for summer courses. I was supposed to be. I tried to retroactively medically withdraw spring semester this year. They didn't put it through and gave me a hard time, so my GPA dipped below a 2.0. Because of that, I was kicked out of my courses for the semester (yet somehow I'm still on the roster, but can't access my online sources on Sakai). I got kicked out, and I am unable to receive my financial aid that is much needed (I'd be getting around $6000 back). I put in the final steps to hopefully get the petition to withdraw through, and everything should be back to normal within a week. I'm going to be late with rent, and food is low right now in my pantry and fridge. After the week is up, I'll be able to drop my courses that I'm in/not in (it's confusing, and I don't understand it honestly) and I'll be able to sign up for Summer B courses. This will allow me to take $1000 in advance before they distribute the money, and in July I will receive the rest of my money from my aid and scholarships. Also, not to mention, my job is through the school, and because I'm technically not a student and not registered, I am unable to work until it gets cleared.   My girlfriend (20) recently graduated from Santa Fe College and is transferring to Animal Sciences at UF. She is currently working two jobs, but all of that money is going towards electric, internet, car insurance, gas, food, cat supplies, and what little rent we can pay.   I'm sorry for the wall of text. I would appreciate it if someone could be so generous. In return, until I get my money, to the one who offers to pay, my girlfriend will draw a couple of pictures of whatever you'd like done. It's not much, but it's something in return for now. When I get my money back, I'm definitely going to pay for someone else's pizza on here to return the good deed. Thank you again. 	1402094225.0

I was struggling to make ends meet, and you guys really helped me out now and then.  I always promised to give back and now it is time for me to start.  I have graduated, I am gainfully employed, and I'm in a bit of an emotionally rough patch right now but helping others always makes one feel better.  With that said, I would like to give away some pizzas over the next few days.  To start, I would like to give away two: one to a student at Northwestern University and one to a student at any other institute of higher learning.  All I ask, is proof.  I will check back at an undetermined time tonight and pick someone.  I'm sorry that excludes people, but at the moment I want to help out people in a similar position as I was last year.  Edit:  Hey everyone, I really wish I could give everyone a pizza who was nice enough to comment, but I could only give to one, u/pizzaaenthusiast.  The second person I reached out to didn't reply, but I will have another round tomorrow.  Thanks!	1402064100.0
t3_27e9ke	1401987830.0	StephBGreat	shroom	[Request] Rough few weeks	Edit: pizza was gifted! I messaged mods to figure out how to properly thank the gifter.    I'm the mother of 3 small kids. I had my son on 4/28 and our home was hit with a stomach bug when he was 3 weeks old. Thankfully, he didn't catch it, but my 3 yo, 2 yo, husband, and myself all got it. It wasn't bad on the adults, but our two kids had it for 5 days. The dehydration put my 2 to into a seizure and thankfully my husband was present at the time to ride in the ambulance with her.   We've been cleared by neurology this week. My 2 yo appears to be healthy. No one is sick anymore. It's just been a rough few weeks juggling all of this while my hubby works. I've never requested anything like this before but could really use a break trying to feed these three kids and myself all day. We live in Virginia, love pizza, and have a dominoes nearby. 	1402023134.0
t3_27dx1t	1401980404.0	EFCFrost	shroom	[Request] Tomorrow is my wife's birthday and once again her family has completely alienated her. Some pizza might ease the burn.	Thank you /u/hunterjac for being so awesome and granting us the glory that is pizza and being patient with us after someone tried to scam you! You are so wonderful and understanding and have made this weekend end on a high note :D  __________________________________________________  TL;DR My wife's parents are assholes who won't give her the time of day even on her birthday. Could use some birthday/feel better pizza. We live in Nova Scotia Canada  Tomorrow is my wife's birthday! She's going to be 28 years beautiful and I love her very much. Unfortunately her family is a bunch of assclowns who couldn't give two shits about her. Ever since she was a child her parents called her good for nothing and I think that's a load of horse shit.  My wife is the most loving mother, amazing partner and best friend I've ever known and her friends all agree.   This year her parents pretty well flat out told her "happy fucking birthday" and then went about patting themselves on the back like they were all that and a bag of chips.  To put some context into their asshole nature let me lay it out. They called her a whore at every opportunity when she was a teenager, tried to cancel our wedding because "how dare she not marry a Catholic" and pretty much stopped interacting with their grandchild after they found out he was mentally handicapped.  Sorry for the rant but I'm still dealing with how upset she is and shit rolls downhill (happy wife happy life.)  Anyways if possible I think a pizza might help ease her suffering a bit. It's not as good as say her mother giving her a hug but it's something at least to say "Happy birthday and you are amazing."  Anyways if anyone thinks this beautiful amazing woman deserves a pizza please let me know. There's 2 major pizza chains near us (we live in Nova Scotia Canada) and they are Greco's pizza and Pizza Delight.	1402261898.0

t3_279tw8	1401863886.0	thekingearl	FAP	[OFFER - CONTEST] Let's play pizza party scavenger hunt. Lot's of people ask for free pizza. Anyone willing to play a game for the chance to win a you call it $100 pizza party?	**The basics**  The game is a scavenger hunt. If you're not familiar with scavenger hunts you should get out of the house more, but the basic idea is below is a list of ten (10) items not commonly found in every day life for you to seek out and find. First one to collect all ten items wins a $100 gift card to the pizza place of your choice (only restriction is that I must be able to buy you a gift card online with relative ease. I'm looking big three U.S. but if you're international or have a local spot I'll work with you as we can.).  **The rules**  Find all ten (10) items listed below. Take a picture of the item with a slip of paper next to it with your user name, the phrase "pizza party scavenger hunt" and the date next to it. Upload your pictures to an album on a picture hosting site (imgur, photobucket, whatever). First person to find all ten with their pictures properly processed wins a $100 gift card to the pizza place of their choice. Mods may impose additional rules at their discretion and as always 60 days or older accounts only can win. In the event more than one person has completed the hunt prior to my declaring a winner the first person in/posted wins.  **Specifics**  No photoshopping obviously. The idea is to find the actual physical items. If I suspect photoshopping I reserve the right to DQ anyone. If I DQ you you can appeal to me by PM and send another photo if there is some debate but I reserve right to final ruling. So make it obvious it's a real photo. Your face etc need not be in the photo, just the slip of paper. Same for the requirements of people in the photo, feel free to blur faces. You are welcome to recruit friends to help so not all photos/papers need to have the same handwriting. Get your friends to help you. The prize is a pizza party anyways - you're not really going to eat $100 of pizza by yourself are you? I will check back Sunday (8 June) night my time (in Hawaii, USA) to see if I have a winner. If so they will be notified of their win via PM and then it published. If not, I will continue checking day to day until someone does win with the same protocol being followed.  **The scavenger list**  1. A copy of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III" on VHS (VHS only - IMO the hardest item to find on the list).  2. Any "Legend of Zelda" video game.  3. A box of "Fruit Loops."  4. A female wearing any type of "bunny ears" (homemade acceptable - face may be blurred).  5. A male giving the "shaka" (not shocker)/hang loose/surfer thumb and pinky Hawaiian sign (face may be blurred). Google if you don't know. I like in Hawaii so its a thing here.  6. A remote controlled car.  7. Any super hero action figure.  8. Three or more people giving a "thumbs up" (faces may be blurred).  9. A carton of milk (in any volume....can be plastic, cardboard, whatever).  10. Any movie poster.  **Information irrelevant to winning**   Why are you doing this?  I'm bored and have $100 to spare. I'm curious to see if people who ask for free pizza will put in an effort for free pizza.  Why a $100 pizza party?  I definitely wouldn't hunt this garbage down for a $15 pie, but might for a hundy. Figured it was the going rate.  How did you come up the scavenger hunt items?  My Tuesday night poker buddies are as drunk as I am. We all threw in random crap. Random was the idea.  What is the purpose?  Someone gets a free pizza party. Maybe they have fun "earning" it. Maybe not. We'll see I guess.  **Good luck.**  **I have PMed the winner. Congratulations to them. I'll post their username after they claim (IAW the sub's guidelines to ensure he is the one I give the pizza to). Sorry about the delay (I know I said Sunday night) in declaring a winner, I had some work/personal life stuff come up that kept me from my lazy man reddit time. Thanks everyone for playing and I hope the winner enjoys his free pizza. It was fun and I'll do it again sometime. Thanks as well to the nice guy as well who gave me gold. I didn't even really believe that was a thing until now. I'll prob do another one next month or something since I had fun doing it.**       **---WINNER DECLARED: u/nesswithanL has claimed his prize and we're working out the details. Can't believe how quickly he produced a copy of TMNT III on VHS. That's some pizza worthy stuff right there.---**	1402558276.0

t3_26z51d	1401563710.0	PerkPrincess	shroom	[Request] SO GUESS WHO JUST ENDED THEIR HOMELESSNESS? THIS GAL. Empty cupboard until monday, would welcome a pizza!	Feeling really really good right now. I've been at probably the lowest point of my life and have managed to crawl my way back into a really nice room in a shared house.  I'm suffering pretty badly from PTSD which kinda managed to wreck my life when it caused a really bad bout of depression that sucked all life out of me and basically accelerated my own life falling apart.  Things were looking pretty bleak, until a stray cat adopted me. Ended up falling in love with her. She's a huge sweetie.  With the sudden mouth to feed, I managed to get a hold of my doctor and have worked out a way into recovery. I'm now on short term disability, which has just now come in. I kinda thank this cat for miraculously showing up to even help me get the willpower together to get this far.  SADLY. All my current on hand cash went to paying my first month rent and deposit. I would really appreciate some pizza for the weekend.   I promise to pay this forward in any way I can, once next cheque comes in.  Edit: I forgot to say that I'm in Victoria, BC. Dominos has some -very- cheap online coupons.	1401569118.0

I will pick two (2) (okay, maybe more depending on the responses), winners at 3:00 CST on Friday, May 23rd.  One of my favorite childhood books: The Five Chinese Brothers.

t3_265viy	1400714553.0	neurotoxin_inspector	shroom	[Request] I've been eating ramen (and nothing else) for the past 7 days, and I'm getting really sick of it.	~~~~I made a horrific miscalculation in my budget this month and as a result, screwed myself and was forced to spend my last 10 bucks or so on a couple of boxes of ramen.   I am not good with shopping and/or money. I know.  While ramen is delicious and should be part of every person's life, I think that ramen and I need some time off to think about going our separate ways.  Maybe I should see other food on the side. A pizza perhaps?  Thanks for your consideration.  edit: I should point out that I am located in Greensboro,  North Carolina~~~~  **UPDATE: I have been sent food. I am all set.

t3_25szxb	1400349795.0	Basicallyeleven	shroom	[REQUEST] It's my birthday today.	Today I turn 26, which means that I'm no longer covered by my father's health insurance, and the reality of adulthood is finally settling in. Mom died two years ago next month, Dad isn't too far behind her, work is disappointing and those childish dreams of the future just seem sad to me now.   Growing up is really lame.  I don't make enough at work to support myself *and* spoil myself, so today is a tame day in this new city, stuck inside and freezing while I'm used to it being beautiful springtime on my birthday every year. The thing I'm getting at is that I'm sad, chilly, and would really love some pizza to make this birthday something positive and special, and if you'd be my means of making this day memorable, then I have a special place in my heart for you.  **EDIT:** Icarus451 just gave me my first (and probably best or only) birthday present.

t3_22u7q4	1397283359.0	bearXential	PIF	[REQUEST] Sydney, Australia. Lost my job last week. Feeling like crap, worried, stressed... and kinda hungry	So I finished my last day of work last Friday, and my last paycheck came in, where I had to pay bills and rent with. I paid rent two weeks in advance, because I honestly don't know when my next paycheck will come from.  My car isn't paid off yet, and I need it to look for work, and to get to work when I do find one. So I'm really worried at this point in time.  Factor in the fact that I forgot about grocery shopping in the whole budget, because I thought I may have enough food to survive for a while longer, but I was wrong.  I'm not asking for any sympathy, and although I'm worried and stressed, I'm confident I can get through this. It's been a while since I visited this sub, but it sure did put a smile on my face when I received and given pizzas to others. This is an awesome place.  So, without further babbling, anyone want to pizza me? ________________________________________________  **UPDATE**  /u/MyCatOwnsMe just gifted me an awesome, AWESOME pizza dinner and more!!!

t3_22kq9q	1397012035.0	chemistreddit	shroom	[THANKS] to MCRAGEQUIT science can continue!	First off, a **huge** thank you to /u/MCRAGEQUIT. Here's my story:   I'm a 4th year PhD student studying physical chemistry (I also have a [science blog/podcast](http://www.thecollapsedwavefunction.com) if you're interested). Tonight I was stuck working long, *long*, ***long*** hours in the lab. Probably close to 26 hours by the end of everything. I stumbled upon this subreddit at decided to give it a try. Totally worth it - I will be paying it forward for sure.   [Here's a picture](http://imgur.com/a/rQgR9) of my lab as well as the pizza on my desk. I had a bunch of extra money on the gift card. I figured I could either buy more pizza that would probably go to waste, save the balance for another day, or help the young kid that delivered it out. I chose to leave the rest of the gift card as a tip. When I told the delivery guy that a stranger had bought me the pizza and I was leaving the rest to him as a tip he was super happy. So really /u/MCRAGEQUIT made my night and his. Thank you, good sir/ma'am.   PS - If anyone has any questions regarding my research or science in general I'd be willing to answer a few (I'm also a panelist on /r/askscience, so you can also find me there).	1397012421.0

t3_22j6wl	1396978676.0	flobin	pizza	[META] How to buy pizza (internationally) with bitcoin!	^note: ^this ^guide ^written ^for ^people ^new ^to ^bitcoin  **Why?**   Buying pizza internationally has always been difficult. RAOP does have an [international ordering guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ns3dj/the_definitive_guide_to_ordering_internationally/), but it’s two years old. The main difficulty with ordering pizza internationally stems from the fact that often, when paying for something online using a credit card, you cannot have the delivery address and billing address be in different countries.  But not with bitcoin! A payment in bitcoin is the same regardless of where it was made. So if a merchant accepts bitcoin, it does not matter where the person making the payment is from. Awesome!  **Does it work?**     Yep. [I bought someone pizza using bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/21oyfi/offer_buy_a_pizza_with_bitcoin/) a while ago. I live in the Netherlands, they live in the US.  **Okay, so what is this bitcoin thing, anyway?**   Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, digital currency. I know, that’s quite a mouthful. If you want to know more, just head on over to /r/bitcoin and check out the sidebar, check out the [bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page), [trybtc](https://www.trybtc.com/), [this youtube explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo), or [the coinlab bitcoin primer](http://coinlab.com/pdfs/a-bitcoin-primer.pdf).   **Requesting pizza**   The only difference between getting a regular pizza and a bitcoin pizza is that your pizza place needs to accept bitcoins as a form of payment. Sadly, not all pizza places accept bitcoin directly. But there are solutions!  If you live in the US, you can use [pizzaforcoins](http://pizzaforcoins.com/) to order a pizza from Domino’s.    Us Europeans are quite lucky, because Takeaway.com, which operates in several European countries, accepts bitcoin as a form of payment. You can actually order many different kinds of food through their websites.

I am unaware of pizza for bitcoin options in other countries, so if you know any, please do share!   **Ordering/Offering/Giving/Paying for pizza**   Ordering pizza using bitcoin is actually quite easy.  1. *Getting bitcoins*   Obviously, in order to buy someone pizza with bitcoins, you will need to have bitcoins. If you already have some, you can skip this step.   Bitcoins can be obtained in several ways. You can ‘mine’ it, using specialized hardware; you can trade goods or services for it (i.e. work and get paid in bitcoins), much like regular cash; or simply buy some. For our purposes, buying is the best option, as it is the fastest. Bitcoins can be bought on an exchange—a website where you can exchange fiat (dollars, euros, etc.) for bitcoins. The best exchange depends on your location—not all exchanges operate everywhere.   In Europe, some US states, and South Korea [Kraken](https://kraken.com/) is a good option. The number two most used exchange in Europe is [bitcoin.de](https://bitcoin.de/). A note for people with Dutch and Belgian bank accounts: if you want bitcoins instantly, use [bitonic](https://bitonic.nl/), as they use iDeal/Mister Cash.   In the US, the most used exchange is [btc-e](https://btc-e.com/), although personally I am wary of them. Another much used exchange for USD is [bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), whom I’m not familiar with, and there is [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) as well.   There are many more exchanges, most of which can be found through [bitcoinaverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/#EUR). And of course I have to mention [localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/), a global exchange where you can even meet sellers in person and pay in cash.   You should know that creating an account on one of these exchanges usually involves a verification process, often using scans of documents such as your ID or a bank statement. This process can sometimes take more than a day!   Now that you have bitcoins, the best thing to do is not to leave it sitting on the exchange, but to put it in a wallet you control. There are multiple options, many of which are outlined at [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). My personal favorites are [Electrum](https://electrum.org/) (OS X, Linux, Windows, Android) and [Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) (Android). 2. *Paying for pizza*   It’s time to pay for someone’s pizza! You can either post an offer, or respond to someone’s request. If you are responding to a request, make sure that the pizza place they are ordering from accepts bitcoin payments!   In order to pay the bill, you will need to know two things: the address to send the bitcoins to and the amount that you need to send.   You can either order the pizza yourself entirely, using the address someone gave you, or let them order for themselves. In the latter case, they can send you the URL of the transaction page; they can send you a QR code of the transaction that you can scan (the Android app I linked earlier would work well with this); send you the actual transaction link (it will start with bitcoin://) or simply pm you the address and amount. 3. *???* 4. *Pizza!*   And of course, if someone bought you pizza, don’t forget to say thanks!  That’s basically it. I hope this guide was helpful and that many a pizza will be bought using bitcoin. If you have any questions, feel free to ask—I will do my best to answer them.  P.S.

t3_225e6d	1396569978.0	Abetterninja	pizza	[Request] Hello! I'd like to share my favorite poem about pizza, because I love pizza.	I'm making a pizza the size of the sun,   a pizza that's sure to weigh more than a ton,   a pizza too massive to pick up and toss,   a pizza resplendent with oceans of sauce.      I'm topping my pizza with mountains of cheese,   with acres of peppers, pimentos, and peas,   with mushrooms, tomatoes, and sausage galore,   with every last olive they had at the store.      My pizza is sure to be one of a kind,   my pizza will leave other pizzas behind,   my pizza will be a delectable treat   that all who love pizza are welcome to eat.      The oven is hot, I believe it will take   a year and a half for my pizza to bake.   I hardly can wait till my pizza is done,   my wonderful pizza the size of the sun.      By Jack Prelutsky.      Well I hope you enjoyed the poem! I tried to write my own pizza poem but it was..well it was not very good. haha  As always, thanks for reading.      Edit: I forgot to say I live in CO, US. Okay thanks      Edit: Okay so here is MY poem. Let me know which is better. haha      If I had a pizza   I would sit down in my seatsa   I would open up the box   and begin to eatsa    I would eat it all in record time   Boy that first stansa did not rhyme   I will try and make it up really soon   But as you can see Im not in my prime      Now back to my favorite food, pizza   Which rymes with.. leaning tower, pisa   This is really hard I think I lost   Oh well, thanks for reading my poem called Pizza  	1396586469.0

This was about 8 months ago.  Yesterday, I put in a resignation letter.  I do not fit in with the work culture of my current company, even though I love the expat lifestyle it's not good enough.  It's a good thing for me, really, I've weighed the options and made pros/cons lists, the whole nine yards.  I've already got a job lined back up in the US, in the city with my SO.  But, it's still a huge change and I'd love to hear some stories about the BIG CHANGES you've made in life, and the consequences (good or bad).

t3_21i9kb	1395930860.0	nlevesque3	pizzapimp	[Offer] Pizza goes to the BEST SOB STORY. Because I can decide what I spend my money on, and this is what I decided.	If you give me the best sob story, I will get you a pizza.  Edit: This is not a joke post related to the meta post about this subreddit being too charity-driven. ([This one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/21gib5/metathe_typical_once_a_month_this_is_suppose_to/)) I really will give pizza to the best sob story, based on my judgement.   This "random contest" will end tomorrow at noon. Reply with stories before then :)  **EDIT2**: Hey guys, so I read through the stories added so far, and I honestly don't think I can pick. There's a lot of really sad stuff that's happened to a lot of people, and I can't just pick 1 thing as the 'best' thing and get them pizza. I don't want that responsibility. I know I said I would pick the best sob story, but I would rather do this: YOU guys decide. On top of that, I want to try to help as many people as I can,  so I will get the **TOP 3 UPVOTED STORIES** a pizza.  You guys can pick the saddest story that has the most proof, the funniest story that is obviously fake, the funniest story that seems true, the saddest story regardless of truth. Whatever you want. I'm sorry that I am changing what I originally said, but I *really* did not expect this many people to share this many stories. So PLEASE, go through and vote on the stories. At exactly NOON tomorrow, I will take the TOP 3 stories and give them pizza.  If you feel like helping out somebody in this thread that didn't make the top 3, please do so. It's your money and you can do whatever you want to do with it, so please don't think I am pressuring you or trying to guilt you into doing so.  **EDIT3**: About an hour and a half left. To clarify: Winners will be highest upvotes, not net votes (to discourage downvoting other stories)  **LAST EDIT**: Hey everyone! Contest is over, and I have PMed the winners. This was quite an experience, and I'm sorry I couldn't help everyone :( I'll try to stay more active on this subreddit in the future (that stupid life thing gets in the way of my reddit time). THANKS to everyone that posted a story, real or fake. 	1396022388.0

Most of the stuff I can't take with me, as shipping is outrageous and there are no roads to this new job: you either fly or take a boat, and that's all too slow and too expensive to bother with.  So: suggest ways to make the move as easy as PIE (get it?!) Clever ways to sell stuff easily? Smart lifehacks I might not have thought of? Suggestions on where I can find a cheap place to park my car for weeks or months at a time on the cheap? Think of all the crap I'll have to deal with in the coming weeks and give some advice.  If I come back and there are comments from at least 15 users, I'll choose the one I like best and buy you lunch.  (I think the best way to do it is to have you write in the name of your favorite pizza place, your preferred order, and who's name it should be under. Then I can call it in and you can pick it up and/or call yourself and have them deliver).   Let's see if this works!  EDIT: Pizza delivered! It was a false start at first with a gent from Dublin that I just couldn't get in touch with (my fault and my phone plan's lack of international calling). But the pizza has been delivered and I feel great about it!	1396030976.0

t3_21gib5	1395875567.0	jackelfrink	pizza	[meta]The typical once a month "this is suppose to be random pizza, not charity pizza" rant.	Im well aware that sob stories have always been the rule rather than the exception around this place. Even before I became an active member. And almost like clockwork, there are regular posts whining and complaining about how the sidebar says we are not a substitute for r/foodpantry or r/assistance and grousing about how the tales of woe and distress have gotten out of hand.  I have been around for a while now. I guess its my turn to make that rant.  For the first time in weeks, I finally saw an offer that wasn't just playing into the r/foodpantry -slash- r/assistance trope and actually honestly sent out a pizza at random. Maybe it wound up going to someone down on their luck. Maybe to someone doing well. Maybe to someone depressed. Maybe to someone who had a great day. It wasn't anything need based at all. Just a a totally out of the blue freebie to someone the poster did not know.  It had more down-votes than up-votes.  Now yes, the moderators can take some blame for actively encouraging sob stories and charity mentality. But actively down-voting something for not fitting into the woe-is-me guilt trip acts of mercy? Doesn't that signal that the community here simply prefers charity over randomness? Is it finally time to just admit defeat and realize that "today you tomorrow me" philanthropy is the ~real~ purpose behind this subreddit?  I know this post will get absolutely no place. And there will be another 'what ever became of the "random" in random acts of pizza' coming along after mine. But I just had to vent.	1395883757.0

Original request:  Hi all, just thought I'd see if anyone was feeling generous today!  I work with my older sister and we are both broke until next payday (in a week and a half).  We're both staying at the office for our lunch hour to get overtime and neither one has a dime to her name.  She was going to have lunch with her other boss that she does part-time bookkeeping work for, but that fell through.  I'm just conserving groceries and trying to get some overtime!  I am a receptionist, 22 years old, and living alone while trying to pay off student loan debt and a car I'm buying from my sister. I plan on going back to school but trying to pay down my debt and save money for my first year back.  My sister is 27, our accounts payable clerk, and has a little boy who is a year-and-a-half old.  On top of that, she's going to school online full-time and year-round to pursue a career in accounting.  It would be really sweet if someone would send us much-appreciated pizza blessings!  	1395419486.0

t3_20s1vu	1395197574.0	Quaon	shroom	[Request] Pizza for a broke guy who's had car problems and has been eating top ramen for a week?	Like the title says, I've been eating top ramen for about a week. I'm afraid it's all I can afford at the moment.  The weird thing is that the lack of money really snuck up on me. My job is okay, just above minimum wage. Even with that, though, I was saving some money. But last week when I went out to my car, it wouldn't start. I'm a computer guy, so I had no idea what was wrong. Called several family members, but no one answered because of how early it was (5am).  I was able to get a coworker on the phone and willing to pick me up, but he wanted $40 to bring me to work and drop me off after. I had to get there, so I agreed.  I took the next day off work and had my friend come over to my place and tell me it's an alternator problem and it would cost $100. I paid it, he went and bought the part(s?) and did the change-out. After getting a package of top ramen at safeway, that was all the cash I had until my next paycheck (21st).  So yeah, that's where I'm at. When I got home tonight, I thought it would be great to get a pizza, but then I realized my total net worth amounted to what was in my pocket which came to 23 cents. When I get my next paycheck, the first thing I'm getting is a gift card for groceries and putting that away for crap times like this.  Edit: Sorry, forgot to post that I'm in Washington State  2nd Edit: I got pizza! I don't know if the redditor would want me to name him, so I will just say that he is incredibly kind. Pictures of the pizza will be coming shortly.  Edit3: [Pictures!!!](http://imgur.com/a/XAikL)	1395203371.0

So, if you look through my post history, I've posted about depression, feeling suicidal, and other things like that. Well, I finally got myself some high-quality therapy and started to care about myself and what happened to myself.  So I am having a few people over tonight.  Not only is it spring break, and st. patrick's day, but it's also the first time in a long while I'm actually excited about being social with people.   A little pizza (feeding 3-5 people) would be awesome. I prefer e-cards, but can also pick up an order at either Domino's or Papa Johns.  EDIT: Thank you to /u/bassguitarman for the Domino's e-card!

Congrats! PM incoming, good sir!      /u/rhan1161 will be PMing /u/SeeOfNames  soon as well!         Congrats to the winners and thank you for everyone who has submitted!  As a former BIA, I can't tell you how much you're appreciated!       ____       Just found this sub this week, so I'm hoping I'm doing this properly.       As a veteran, I know that money can be tight, *especially* for military families. So, let me help out with a $20 contribution to your weekend pizza!           ________ **RULES**   **1.** Open to military members only. (Don't worry, I'll do another one within two weeks open to more people, just got a bit of O/T :D )   **2.** Post a picture with some proof of being in the service. (You in uniform, a picture of your CAC with *all* of the PII blocked out, etc).   **2a.** Dependents, feel free to submit too! But, if you submit your dependent ID, ensure you block out the pertinents. Not only is your PII on there, but your sponsor's is too!   **3.** This rule makes me sad that I even have to include it. In the *same* picture from rule #2, show a handwritten piece of paper with your username that you're submitting from. This is to prevent some of the awful people from finding random military pictures online and submitting lies to get free pizza.         ____ Tomorrow, 14 Mar 14, at 1800 central, I'll pick a winner from the submissions. Then, I'll PM you asking which of the big 3 you want, get your e-mail, and send you the e-giftcard.        So, let's get to it!       ____ Note: I have three hopes for this offer.   -To help a serviceman (especially military family) in need of pizza.   -To not have this offer turn into a military/veteran bashfest. We don't take too kindly to that.   -If you fake being in, and manage to fool me, I hope the pizza that I buy you burns the roof of your mouth for being an awful person. :D  	1394838429.0
t3_20a1qw	1394670820.0	Kirkbride	shroom	[Request] Stressful weeks dealing with new landlord.. some breadsticks / pizza would be amazing.	My landlord changed, without them telling me, and I had been off work for a week. The previous landlord told me it was okay to pay rent another 2 weeks later. My grandpa passed, and we were moving stuff out of his house.   So the new one sent me an eviction notice today.. After getting her to just hold her horses for a week, payed her every cent I have. I still got a home, and she is working a payment plan for me to pay the rest. An extra 150 bucks I have to pay her because someone couldn't share my problem with another human being.   Anyways, I have a free pizza via points on papa johns but I can't pay the delivery or tip. Even some breadsticks would be awesome.. I don't have a car, I can't currently drive because of my mental status, and I am feeling trapped. Literally sitting at a .30 cents in my account. Was just wondering if someone would be able to help me out, if not with pizza but maybe with some kind words. Kind of in a rut right now.    Thanks.  EDIT: Also, would obviously give back to the community within the next week or two. Figured that was a given, just figured I would add it to the end.  	1394671365.0

t3_1zti19	1394210512.0	rhan1161	pizza-gold	[Offer] Who has gifted pizza after receiving one?	Offer is closed.  Thank you all for keeping your word and/or paying it forward.  Your good deed is recognized and very much appreciated.  I will make this offer again in the future.  Congrats to the lucky winner, /u/hello_amy.   = = = = = =   We've seen a lot of requests for pizza where the OP promises to pay it forward after OP receives his/her paycheck on Friday, tax refunds, student loans, etc.  I don't put a lot of faith on this promise since I personally have seen very few redditors actually kept this promise.  So I'd like to thank and acknowledge those who have received pizza from this RAOP sub and then came back to gift pizza to someone else.  **This offer is for those redditors who have received pizza in the past and then came back to gift someone else pizza.  This offer is for this sub /u/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza only.**  There's a similar offer on the other sub.  Rules:  1.  Post a link to your original pizza request (link #1)  2.  Post a link of you offering or gifting someone else pizza (link #2).  This link can be your offer post (preferred), a thank you post from the receiver, or a screenshot of your PM to the mods.  3.  Unless it's obvious, you have to show me that you gave pizza AFTER you have received one.  I'll pick a winner on Saturday 3/8/14.  Pizza $20 eCard (big 3 chains) for US winner.  Dominos or takeaway.com for UK winner.  Canadian winner, I can try just-eat.ca.  Moral of the offer:   Return the favor.  Don't delete your posts.  Tell mods that you gift pizza.  Show your flair.  Edit: closing the offer  Edit: winner /u/hello_amy 	1394308941.0

t3_1zpbzy	1394091567.0	Whisperers	Whisperers	[Offer] $20 Gift Card if you have made a Thank You post	This offer is for a $20 gift card to any one of the big 3 that the chosen person chooses. I will be doing this again in the future. My reason for doing this is twofold. Firstly, i hope it will encourage people to post 'Thank You' posts in the future because it's the very least you can do if you have been gifted and it costs you nothing to make a Thank You post. Secondly, because i hope to make this a regular thing when i'm in a position to, it will hopefully also encourage people to not delete their posts. (As those posts will be needed in order to enter). So for you to be eligible for this offer, you must go through your history and find a Thank You post you made for someone who gifted you pizza in **THIS** sub and post the link to it in this post. (Only post one). Thank You posts from any other sub **WILL NOT** count so please don't post any. I will choose randomly Friday evening UK time. (To give you an idea of the time, it is Thursday 7.40am UK time at the time of me making this post.) I will then message the person i choose and await their reply stating which pizza place they would like the gift card for.   **Remember, NO Thank you posts from other subs will count. ONLY THIS SUB**  EDIT: No idea why the post is orange instead of green as it is an offer and not a Thank you post? Unless it's because i used the words Thank you in the title.  2nd EDIT: This is for US residents only.  3rd EDIT: I chose /u/cyndikins. I have messaged them and i am awaiting their reply to which of the big 3 they would like their gift card for. Would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who takes the time to make 'Thank You' posts once they have been gifted. It's a small gesture but it goes a long way :)	1394224457.0

t3_1zk03h	1393961325.0	grimskrotum	shroom	[Request] I do not live in poverty, but my girlfriend and I are really struggling, and we don't know what to do.	Hi RAOP, Minneapolis resident here. I'm constantly blown away by the generosity on this sub so I figured I would try here as a last resort. I currently live with my girlfriend and our financial problems have become almost the only thing we talk about anymore. I have recently been let go from my job as an overnight security officer, and her father did not receive tenure as a professor of a small state school. Her parents were usually the ones who pay for our food, but have now told us that they can't continue to do this under their current financial situation. We have applied for food stamps and are currently waiting to hear back. I give plasma just to pay our electricity bill. I don't necessarily want this pizza for me, but for my girlfriend. She has such a giant heart, and regularly volunteers for both HECUA and BEACON (please google - these are incredible organizations for helping our city's poverty problem), and I want to find a way to let her know that her hard work is so appreciated by those who have hit such unfortunate points in their life. I just want to see her not worry about how she's gonna eat next, and not have to scoop peanut butter into a tubberware container for lunch, even if it's just for a day. Thank you so much for reading, you guys are truly the best community on reddit.	1393961782.0

t3_1ypqxh	1393175694.0	DancesWithWolvar	shroom	[Request]My yard is full of human excrement, my landlord is not picking up. Pizza right now would be great.	So for some reason or other my back yard is [flooded with human shit](http://imgur.com/a/aYkwR) - the link is gross, obviously. Apologies for the blurry picture, I'm sure you can understand I was in a bit of a hurry to take it and get the fuck out of there. It has been 2 hours now, and my landlord is still not answering his phone. I appreciate it is Sunday, but my yard is full of excrement. In the end I sent him a picture. No response as of yet.  Was supposed to go to the supermarket for dinner, but understandably got a bit held up. Shops are now closed, my kitchen is right by the yard and even though we have closed ALL doors and windows there is still a horrible cloying smell in there (combination of poop and air freshener) and understandably myself and my two housemates are reluctant to step foot in there.  In short, pizza right now would be marvellous. In the UK, but we have a dominos near us (and a 50% off code). I hope this makes you feel better about your own current situation.  **Edit**: formatting  **Edit Edit**: realised was unclear from post, am not asking for multitude of pizzas. We are students, well accustomed to sharing a pizza between us :D   **Edit Edit Edit**: Just realised at no point did I say please. Please? Pretty Please? With an olive on top?   **Update**: 6 hours on, still nothing from the landlord. Can only assume he does not answer his phone on Sundays. Awesome. So I had to go out in the *dark* and try to wash away the shit. As you can see, my yard is flat, walled and gated. Basically I had to don my fucking wellies, open the gate to the back street and just throw water across the yard. This was not an easy process, but I did succeed in moving the poop several yards over and on to the road.   *Down side number 1*- No drain in the back street anywhere near my house. Brilliant.  *Down side number 2* - Angry man from across the street comes over and starts yelling at me about how it stinks and how dare I wash **MY** poop into the street. Now by this point I am understandably beyond stressed, I did the stabby finger-point thing to his chest and said actually I expected the shit was at the very least *communal* from the three resident upstairs and two residents downstairs, and in fact had I even had a shit today? No, I didn't think I had. Maybe this morning? Nope, I remember, I had wholegrain pasta last night and that tends to take a while to progress through my bowels.  So, I said, if he has a better suggestion then please enlighten me. If the plumber or who even had even been sent out, they would have had to do the same. Clearly, that particularly drain is not going to be suitable for flushing away the poop - (infact, we recently discovered that if we turn on our taps or flush the toilet it just causes more poop to come up).  It's like that scene from Dogma with the shit demon. And I faced it. In my pink wellies from the kids section at M&S. 	1393200107.0

Due in April but just found out because of pre eclampsia I probably won't make it that far. Usually Mom's with it deliver between 34-37 weeks. Next week I re-do my creotine/protein test again and that will determine if I am going on actual bedrest or going into hospital. At that point my five year old will be going to stay with one of my best friends. I'll miss her. A pizza would be nice for today and she would be really surprised.   Its me and my five year old while my husband works. He just started his new job and his first paycheck was for $20.00. So that went in the gas tank. No sob story really I have soup and sandwich type stuff here but a pizza from Pizza Hut or Dominoes would be much tastier. Its been about six months since we had anything like that, I know my five year old would certainly love it.

t3_1xvdgx	1392352520.0	jarrettbraun	PIF	[REQUEST] Can't decide on dinner; spent a bunch at the vet today.	I'm not broke, so I'm not that kind of hungry. My SO loves pizza and we spent a little much at the vet on the kitty. Took a big chunk out of this week's budget. If you wanna give, that's awesome. If not, then we can probably find something at home, so not a big deal. Just trying to have a little fun on here.   **Edit:** So, didn't see this coming. SO is pretty hungry and we decided to just make something from home for the night. I didn't want to spoil this for her, so I didn't mention it and said we'll just cook something. If you see this and want to give, I'll still accept. It would still be a great surprise for my SO this weekend. It just looks like we won't be doing it tonight. I would definitely give thanks though and I appreciate anyone and everyone who has taken time to read this. You guys seriously are the best.	1392353666.0
t3_1xtckc	1392310928.0	JussKiddin	pizza-gold	[Offer] East Coast - Pizza for a snow worker	Hi everyone. It's been a while since I've given a pie away. Today's special pies goes to workers who have been plowing, salting, sanding, etc. This is inspired by the redditor who posted a one day photo journal of her and her father plowing and explaining what goes into the plowing procedure. And of course this snow storm we seem to be stuck in.   Here's what you need to do to qualify: Post a picture of yourself. Include a time card in the photo. Include your work truck in this photo.  Bonus points for showing off the snow in the area you are working on!   I'll be giving out 3 $10 gift cards to the pizzeria of your choice (Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Papa Johns) with winners chosen at my discretion. Verification is required at the time of notification of winning. This will stay open until I give all three cards away.  Thank you for your hard work at keeping out streets clean and a bit safer!  Good luck!  Two winners: kylec00per wizardfingers  Due to lack of eligible submissions, I'll go ahead and close this prematurely. The last card will be given away at a further date. Thanks everyone.	1392665973.0
t3_1xn6lu	1392151306.0	rhan1161	pizza-gold	Buying eCard in the US for Canadian friends	Has anyone in the US ever ordered eCard for Canadian requesters?  Someone told me that eCard purchased on the US websites (e.g., Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa John) will not work in Canada.  Is this true?  I also found out that the big three pizza chains have Canadian websites (www.dominos.ca, www.papajohns.com/canada, www.pizzahut.ca).  So if I purchase eCard from these sites, will the eCard work in Canada?  Anyone knows?  More info from the Canadian sites: Dominos has a link to buy Canadian eCard.  Papa John site points to the US site for purchasing ecard.  I can't find a link to buy Pizza Hut eCard.  Any insight or experience?  Edit: added more info	1392151924.0

t3_1xjiqv	1392060223.0	wizardfingers	PIF	[OFFER] PiF	**edit:** I'm gonna start giving away pizza(s) today. 2/13/14 1:00PM EST   **edit #2:** 2:45PM EST I'm done reading all 80+ comments and checked out your profiles, some of you have such nice faces and lady parts. I appreciate all your comments and love, but some of you have no history of making [Request] for pizza.   **I'd like to remind the RAoP'ers of rule #5**   Do not delete your posts from this subreddit or be less than honest.    I also noticed a few of you don't even have an account aged over 60 days.   I've started the process of giving away pizza, so if you're reading this and haven't made a post its too late.  redditors pizza'd: lyons4231, ichooseyoupika2  & ghostrider90    --------- Two years ago I was just a guy that visits reddit frequently- I still am of course lol, I just happen to find RAOP and didn't expect any results, but there was. I still have my [REQUEST] post up to this day, sadly I'd like to recognize my giver, but has deleted his/her account.  Anyway onto the real reason why I've made this post. You've been on RAOP requesting for pizza, right? All you have to do is post here no need to post a story, you've already made a post I will check each member's posts for validity, and give pizza(s) accordingly.  During these years I've been able to keep a job and to this day I'm still working. I'm a frugal individual and I have a couple dollars saved it wasn't specifically for RAOP, but for me. Instead of treating myself I'd like to treat someone else. I was just gonna save it ( ˘ ³˘)♥  Again, no need to post a sob story- just post so I can check out your profile, if you do I will ignore your post. Read. A good thing to include in your post if not already included in your past posts is where you like to get your pizza from.   I will start giving pizza(s) within 24 - 48 hours. Thank you RAOP, Thank you reddit. If I could afford to give you'll pizza I really would. ^ ω ^   ~~Edit; I'm sorry about the delay I might need another 24hours, will keep you updated :-)~~	1392335296.0
t3_1xhjzr	1392001291.0	livingmaster	FAP	[Request] So hungry, broke and stuck in snow here in West Seattle.	Hi! I've got myself in a bit of a crappy situation. Had to pay some unexpected bills this week leaving me with $6 to last until next Friday. I've bought a pizza or two for people on here in the past and I am hoping I can now benefit from a strangers kindness. I'm on day three of not eating anything substantial and pizza sounds orgasmic right now. Not picky at all but Papa Johns or Dominos sound like heaven.  EDIT: if I get so lucky to receive pizza, I will pay you back with as much pizza as you want on the 15th guaranteed  EDIT TWO: ALL IS GOOD. There are some truly wonderful people in this community and I can't wait to give back in a week. I get to eat- yay!!!!!!!!!!	1392005738.0

t3_1xdyp4	1391898321.0	synthetic_sound	FAP	[Contest] Olympics party!! 15 dollars to one of the Big 3 to the redditor with the best "favorite Olympic moment" story! Offer is here in America, but in the spirit of the Olympics, I'm going to do my best to include people from all parts of the globe!	/edit - So many awesome stories and memories...it was hard to chose a winner, but /u/trickedoutdavid wins! Thanks everyone for sharing these incredible stories :)   I'm going to be really honest with you folks. I am...not super patriotic. As a matter of fact, I don't really understand patriotism. That is...until it's Olympic time. And then I turn into a crazy patriot. It's so weird. But these athletes from all over the world inspire me so much. I can't imagine what it must be like to dedicate your entire life to something, and then have that moment in which you realize *you are the best in entire world at what you do at that moment*.   So, in honor of the Olympics, I want you to tell me your favorite Olympic moment. Bonus points if you include video! I love rewatching this stuff! Tell me why it was your favorite! I'll pick one or two people come Monday for a giftcard!   I'm really happy to include the entire WORLD in this contest, but if someone from outside the US wins, I'll need you to be patient with me while I figure out how to get a GC to you, ok? Also, since it's a bit more expensive, I might have to get it to you next weekend (I wait tables).   Can't wait to hear what everyone comes up with!  A few other things to note:  -If you've won a contest or been gifted a pizza in the past couple of weeks, please don't enter. Let's spread that cheesy goodness around!  And I know this is going to sound petty as hell, butttt   - If you've won a pizza at any time *and didn't make a thank you post to whoever bought you the pizza*, please don't enter here. There have been SO many requests filled lately by kind people, and I mean, MAYBE one or two thank you posts a day. That's ludicrous. So yeah. If that's you, don't bother.   - Finally, be prepared to do the verification thing. And please have an account older than three months, and please have posted in other subs besides this one (or the other random acts subs).   Thanks again everyone!! :D	1392075126.0

Thanks to EVERYONE for participating in this. I enjoyed my warm welcome back to this sub. I look forward to future fun. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **EDIT:** About 3 hours left! I want more to participate. So, if you're someone who isn't watching the game but wants some 'za, tell me why you're not watching the game and show me a pic of what you're doing instead. Can't take a pic? DRAW A PICTURE! This will still be a random contest, but I will only include names of those joining in on the fun. GOOD LUCK!  **EDIT 2:** Thanks to everyone participating. My day has taken me on a little adventure, so I won't be able to give away pizza for another hour or so. Sorry about this, but I promise pizza will be coming soon.   **EDIT 3:** Just made it home in time for kickoff. Winner announcement very soon!   **EDIT 4:** WINNER HAS BEEN CHOSEN! Waiting for verification and I will keep you all posted. Sorry it took so long. My laptop decided to not work for some random reason... ______________________________________________________________________________________________  For my first contribution to this thread, I would like to give away some 'za on the biggest junk food eating day of the year, the **SUPER BOWL!**  **Let's make this a contest:**  If you're planning on watching the big game, post a picture of your set-up. By this, I mean your TV, favorite chair, beer, etc... Show me how you plan to enjoy the game. With that post, include which of the big three chains you prefer and who you're rooting for in the game.  **THAT'S IT!**  Now, I do have a catch and this will only succeed through an honest winner... If you're my lucky (random) winner, I would like you to post another picture of you enjoying the pizza with the game on in the background.  I hope this all goes well. I have faith in this community and I know a lot of good has come from it. Let's make this a fun Super Bowl Sunday. If my experience goes well, I was thinking of returning to give away more on my upcoming cake day... So you can see that as an opportunity for the future.  As I said, I'm new to this. I had a brief negative encounter in the past and I feel now is the time to try this again. I've never received, but I'd love to give one away and make someone happy while they watch football (but mostly the commercials/Puppy Bowl).  I will pick my winner by **5PM EST**. That should give enough time to get some delivery before the game starts. If you have any questions or comments, please post them. As I said (three times now... ?), I'm new to this. Anything anyone has to help me out in making this a more magical and successful contest, let me know! It's bed time now. Good luck to you all. I look forward to your entries!   **SHOW ME THOSE LIVING ROOMS!!!**	1391387743.0

He chose this, instead of going out in the cold. I was up for either, but he loves seeing responses, and having me read the more interesting ones to him. So spam this request all you want, with cool comments and/or a pizza! Either would help a young boy have a great time with an awesome community!

t3_1wputr	1391246118.0	capt_badass	pizza	[Contest] Pizza for travelers	Alright team - I'm trying to come up with a good idea for a week long trip to take with my SO.  We're planning on something at the beginning of March while she is on Spring Break.  The interesting caveat is that we both live literally across the world from one another, and I'm trying to think of a good place to meet that doesn't require one of us to fly 30+ hours to where the other one is living.  I'm in SE Asia, and she is in Texas.  That said - show me your favorite travel photo and share some kind of story.  I don't really care where it is, whether it is the Grand Canyon or Lake Baikal.  Which ever photo/story combo is my favorite after 24ish hours will win a 25$ gift card to one of the big three, or if you have a local pizza chain where I can order online, I'm open to that as well.  Contest will be closed ~4 AM EST tomorrow (2/2/14) morning.  Messaged the winner, thanks guys for the awesome entries.	1391346732.0
t3_1wol3z	1391208270.0	ashleythegreat	pizza-gold	[Offer] To someone who isn't a parent! (USA)	**edit**: It was really difficult to choose just one of you, but I have chosen a recipient! Thanks for leaving all the great comments! Congratulations ScarletBegonias1965!  Congratulations if you have managed to avoid creating another person so far. I'm willing to give away one $20 Papa Johns e-gift card to someone who is not a parent. There have been two recent offers to parents, and I felt the need to even things out.  Also, it's Friday! Happy weekend!  My rules:  * Account must be at least 60 days old, and your comments can't all be about you asking for pizza/stuff (my discretion). * I will PM the winner and will need his or her verification code and email address so I can send the e-gift card. Don't PM me first. * If you use this for delivery, for the love of all that is cheesy, please tip your driver. If you don't have any $$ for a tip, please order carry-out.  Here are some optional fun questions to answer:   Why do you want a pizza, and what wonderful reason do you have for not procreating yet? Do you have a rescued fur-baby? What's your favorite guilty pleasure (e.g. eating an entire package of thin mints, listening to Britney Spears, reading shit like 50 Shades of Grey)? How much do you love cheese? Who's your favorite comedian?  	1391210610.0
t3_1wog02	1391205171.0	davethecomposer	shroom	[Thanks] to /u/closet_genius! In exchange for a an original composition and a piece of fanfic written for wife, he hooked me up BIG TIME!	You can read the original request [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1waw0q/request_recently_homeless_but_will_compose_a/) but basically the idea was that I would compose a piece of experimental classical music or write the subject into a piece of fanfic based on whatever universe they wanted in exchange for a pizza.  /U/closet_genius offered to pay more than that if I would do both and put his wife into *Sex and the City*. Obviously I said yes. So here are links to results (note: the names have been sanitized -- /u/closet_genius is not married to Buffy):  [The fanfic story](http://ubuntuone.com/0IeZHhlkhLIY05uYBw1G4K) /u/closet-genius and his wife live in Australia, thus the plot of this story   [Mp3](http://ubuntuone.com/1wFGEUuHarElam9scCKzBk)   [Sheet music pdf](http://ubuntuone.com/1ltHG6nTkhjDyh8HIA6xFt)    Notes: I had not ever seen an episode of *Sex and the City* so I had to base the characters on whatever I could find about them on the internet. The music, based on the theme music of the show, started off as a fugue but when I realized it was going to stretch several pages and several days I changed it into some variations on a theme. The fugue part is preserved in the first section but then you can see where it becomes just the variations (though a generous reading would call that the development section of the fugue which ends without a secondary theme or recapitulation). The music is nothing like my usual experimental classical stuff but since it was for his wife I made something using conventional Western European harmony and tonality.  There were all sorts of logistics problems with getting a pizza to me. For one I'm homeless. Ie, there's no place for someone to deliver a pizza for me to (I could have lied about an address but then I'd be eating pizza outside and I really wanted to eat in a warm place). There is a Pizza Hut with a dining room about 2 miles from where I normally am, which is a very doable walk, but we agreed that instead of messing with all that he'd just send me the money via Paypal (if anyone else wants to buy me a pizza I will definitely walk the two miles to get it).   Once I received the money I decided to go a little different for the food. And I apologize to the sub for this but all the pizza places in the downtown Bellingham area are really nice and really expensive. Instead I started off at [Rocket Donuts](http://i.imgur.com/vLZO6lv.jpg) with a [raspberry cronut and a chocolate Bavarian creme thingy](http://i.imgur.com/7qHkN9c.jpg) (you can see the laptop that I used to do all this on in the background). Then I went to an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet joint called Indian Grill. At $7.95 it was a bargain. Here's the first [plate](http://i.imgur.com/0jl98xR.jpg). It doesn't look very appetizing in that picture but it was good (also my camera is a Nintendo 3DS which is a really crappy camera). I had many, many more plates and am insanely stuffed.  In the end I had a lot of fun doing this and am very grateful to /u/closet_genius for being so generous in paying me for the rather modest works I produced. Today was literally my first hot meal in a week and it was incredible.  I would love to do this for other people. I do not want to create another post and possibly divert a pizza going to some other needy person so I thought I'd just leave this here. If anyone wants a piece of fanfic (their choice of universe) or an original experimental 20th century classical composition or both, then please pm me and we will work something out.    It would make a terrific Valentine's day gift for your Valentine. Fanfic and music all nicely typeset with whatever dedication you want specifically commissioned by you for them. It will melt a heart or two. And obviously I will work with you on all the subject matter.  Thanks again, reddit, /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, and /u/closet_genius for this. I am well-fed and have enough money to purchase food to last for weeks.  PS Dang, I forgot to mention that today is my birthday so the food was especially appreciated. I'm not big into celebrating my own birthday but had to admit spending it homeless and hungry seemed particularly pitiable. 	1391207477.0

t3_1wksnl	1391108191.0	tashtash	pizza	[REQUEST] (Canada) I find myself in a cast again, stuck at home for a few weeks.	Ima try this again, last time someone offered, they were not able to follow through due to international BS.   I just had a surgery to remove a broken screwed from my ankle, it was supposed to be lickety-split quick and I was supposed to walk away from it, but getting the screw out left a dime sized hole in my tibia + fibia. I've been ordered no work until mid March, back on crutches but mostly stranded at home. Snow + ice and crutches don't really mix well.   I can put proof, whatever I can take a picture of, if need be. I can try to get the cat in, but she's too aloof to come when called.   Bonus points : recently discovered ordering online with justeat.ca, can pay by card and have a discount code for 25% off (DONTCOOK25). Feel free to use it for yourself :)    EDIT: got the kitty in a [picture :)] (http://i.imgur.com/UdqG2Ka.jpg) 	1391114270.0

(Houston Texas)	So I was unemployed for a long time and I finally got a job, only problem is I had to wait 3 weeks instead of 2 for my first check. I thought I could space what little I had out but I just ran short. It'd be amazing if I could get some help from anyone, even the smallest cheese pizza would be so appreciated. I'm pretty good at conserving food.   I normally wouldn't ask like this but times are about to get better for me once I start getting paid. I'm at the last long stretch. Soon I'll be able to give pizza to people too. Thank you all so much for your time.	1391043101.0

t3_1vtcct	1390355564.0	ShirakFaeryn	PIF	[Request NW Ohio]Finally found a place that delivers to me!	After seeing a pizza hut driver drop some pizza off to a neighbor of mine, I learned that with some creative wording on the address, pizza can indeed be delivered here. Just have to tell them the address across the street with a note to driver telling them to deliver it to the real address.   Only working part time right now until more hours become available or another opportunity presents itself so I would love some assistance in celebrating this discovery. Haven't had a running vehicle for a while now otherwise I'd just order it for pickup now and then. Wife is out for the next few days and I don't feel like cooking.  Whether or not I get pizza, thanks in advance for reading anyways, and will pay this forward again when I get some spare money like last time :)  [Edit: I seem to have forgotten to mention, but in my neighborhood the only place that will deliver pizza here is a local bar/restaurant. Unfortunately their pizza couldn't beat a Tostino's in a blind taste test.]	1390356595.0

Which will mean restarting my 2nd year. But my mum covers my rent and is being very unsupportive, despite knowing I am ill.  When I officially move off my course for the rest of this year I will lose my maintenance loan. I have no work experience so getting a job will be hell on earth. Money will simply dry up.   I just... I could do with a pizza. Its my comfort food. Which I can no longer really afford. Or a chat. A chat would really do. Things are grim.  Yeah, Kind people of this subreddit. Fuck the pizza. Everyone is asleep. Just talk to me.  EDIT: Holy hell dude!  You got me sides as well? Seriously. Fucking awesome. Profiteroles? Potato wedges?  You are officially a bro.	1390414774.0

Or, if you don't play games, what is something on Netflix you believe I should absolutely watch?	/edit - /u/hungrydyke is the winner! Thanks everyone for the awesome suggestions! Y'all are pretty freakin rad :D   Hey there RAoP! It's been awhile, and I have some extra money to spare, so I thought I would have another contest! The rules are pretty simple...I just want to know what your favorite ps3 game is, and why you think I should absolutely check it out. I finally bought one for myself over Christmas, and I absolutely love it, and I've had the best time checking out new games. Especially indie ones for some reason (seriously...*Limbo* and especially *rain* are two of the most gorgeous, poignant, and fantastic games I've ever played). In case anyone is wondering, my favorite game is *The Last of Us*, and I'm also a huge fan of the *Bioshock* series.   And for those of you who may not play games, Feel free to tell me about stuff I should check out on Netflix! I'm always up for checking out new movies and TV shows :D  I'll pick a winner sometime tomorrow, and you're all competing for a $15 GC to your choice of the big 3! So good luck everyone...can't wait to hear all your awesome suggestions!   OH! I forgot to mention that the winner will have to use the verification system. I hate doing that, but it seems like there's been a lot of scamming happening lately, and that makes me sad. So yeah. Better safe than sorry and all that. 	1390181812.0
t3_1vcpd9	1389866726.0	FamilyDuck	shroom	[Request] mega broke until I get paid for the painting I just shipped, and this all ramen diet is affecting my brain.	Hey raop crowd. I am an artist. I was going to go travel and find work/another state to live in, but I fell sick over Christmas due to stress, getting 4 different types of infections and the flu at once. I'm better now, but spent my money on doctor visits and meds, so not only are my travel funds down the drain, but I cannot afford my own place or even to eat anything but ramen for every meal. I hate to have a tone if desperation- trust me, I feel incredibly blessed and especially lucky that Maruchan devised 17 cent meals for the likes of me and I have a warm spot to stay until I can afford to travel- but I want nothing more than to lustily gaze into a greasy pile of toasty, hot cheese, garlic, green olives, and tomato sauce. Seriously. Thank you in advance!   edit: I have a coupon for free breadsticks with a large pizza from pizza hut. Pizza me and I will be mucho happy!	1389898183.0
t3_1v6xe8	1389710144.0	CUP_OF_BROWN_JOY	shroom	[Request] Failed an exam, feeling down, and I just want to eat some pizza. Will play guitar for you. [UK]	So I had some Law exams here in rainy old England, and they didn't go so well. I know i've failed at least one of them. It's making me doubt myself, and i'm two years into this degree. I'm feeling like general crap, and have another exam tomorrow, which I know i'm gonna fail. I'm sat trying to revise as much as possible, and it feels like the walls are tumbling down. I'd never show this weakness to my friends or family, largely because of pride. They all think i'm doing great, and that i'm loving life at university. It couldn't be farther from the truth.  But, this is reddit, and I'm not so sure my pride matters here. I just want to eat some pizza while I woefully revise for my exam in a degree I don't think I even want. It'd cheer me up, quite a lot.  I don't have a lot to offer, as my student loan just went on rent, and the money I earn from working 6 hours a week goes straight into my food budget. I have about £1.50 I can contribute to the cost of a pizza, which would be nice. I think Domino's has some inexpensive(ish) deals on at the moment.  In return I could play you a song if you'd like, I'm an okay singer and guitar player. I can surprise you, or you can ask me for something.  Anyway, there are people perhaps more deserving than I for pizza, I don't doubt it, but I could use a boost.	1389712611.0

My new employer is offering a signing bonus *after I move* rather than relocation funds *before the move*, and my old job doesn't pay much. I have less than two weeks to pack and move on a shoestring budget, and between kitchen stuff already being packed and the time loss for cooking, I've been skipping meals. Pizza would be most definitely helpful, and after my move and first paycheck I'll have the funds to come back and bestow such goodness on others.  If interested in helping me out, I'm in Kentwood, MI (near Grand Rapids) and the closest chain is Pizza Hut - but there's a Domino's and a Jet's nearby as well.	1389553974.0

I am waiting on an invoice to be paid (I am self employed) and am down to the dust in the cupboard. The thing is I am on a keto diet which means I can't eat wheat and need to consume a high amount of fat. With this is mind, and it being cheaper, could someone help me out with a mixed grill via a takeaway site. This will last me two days which is a bonus :). Thanks for reading. If any one is interested, I have lost 26kg since mid September, and this week I started running. Today I took part in an organised park run. My first ever 5km run and I did it in 38 minutes, which I'm quite proud of given I have not run in 12 years! :)  Edit: If it is of any persuasion, I have forwarded pizza and will do again. 	1389463264.0

t3_1tufw7	1388192569.0	triceratopses	shroom	Request 2: Still Gamin'	I requested a pizza last night and it didn't happen for me. In fact some guy hassled me because I didn't sound like I needed pizza enough.  Me and my buddies are gonna play Path of Exile/Dota 2/maybe l4d2 all night (didn't end up doing it last night unfortunately, I had to go home and make a triple stacker turkey sandwich) and I'm personally too poor to buy food and too lazy to travel the 45 minute Omaha bus ride home. I feel like Ron Weasley on the Hogwarts Express without a Harry benefactor. So pretty much a pizza would be the ultimate success story. It's not like I'm going to die if someone doesn't help a buddy out, I'm not afraid to go without, and honestly the new clothes I got for christmas will thank you if you don't help me, but I would be so hyped.  I start a new job next week so I'm trying to get as much gamin' in as possible before I [9-to-5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaERHs8Q93E) it all the time again.

I'm on a diet for a boxing match up and can't have it.  So I want to live vicariously thru you.  Offer:  this is my 1st raop offer, but I'm pretty active in other random subs, so let me know if I missed something.  Would request the verification thingy. I'll get you pizza from a major chain, you eat it, post what you liked and what (if anything) could have been better.   Happy Festivus!	1387736159.0

t3_1taqtj	1387508646.0	Flightly	shroom	[REQUEST] For a friend, left alone at home while her father is out. No food, money	Hello Reddit! I'm making this request on behalf of a friend of mine. She is home alone with no food. Her father left her alone without anything to eat or any money to buy any food for herself. He is currently out of the house at a restaurant. There is a history of neglect and this is not an isolated incident. She is begging for food but, since she doesn't have an account on Reddit, I asked her if I could make a post for her and she said she would be very thankful. I would buy her a pizza myself but I don't have any money, either. We are a few states away from each other so there is no way I can help her right now.  "My dad hasnt bought groceries in a week, we have absolutely no food my stomach can handle, and my dad refused to leave money for me to order or get food, and im very hungry… my dad is a class A asshole and ive been needing food for a while :T"  "I have nothing to sell! Plus I dont have a bank account"  "Food is exactly what I dont have right now because my piece of shit dad didnt buy groceries or leave me money for food,"  If someone could buy her something to eat tonight, we would both be very grateful! Thank you! As thanks, she is willing to draw whoever buys her dinner tonight a picture of whatever they want as thanks. :)	1387508851.0

Some friends and I are using a great new service known as [Gyft.com](http://www.gyft.com) that allows for the easy buying and sending of gift cards, and, happens to accept the wonderful currency [Bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin) as payment. We've loaded our account up with gift cards to Burger King, Amazon, CVS, and all sorts of places (Photo: http://i.imgur.com/En9jUQT.jpg), and we'd like to help those who could use it most during this holiday season.  If you could use a nice sandwich, or anything else we may be able to help with, we'll try our best to help those who need it most for as long as we can.  We'll be posting here and on a couple other subreddits, we'll be contributing at least 1 Bitcoin of our own money to start, and for anyone interested in contributing I posted a separate thread on the Bitcoin subreddit that can be found here: [Merry Bitcoin! - Giving Back For the Holidays](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1t4jg2/bitcoin_christmas_has_officially_begun_using/), and hopefully if others donate we can keep this going even longer, and help even more people.

t3_1t1lbv	1387235465.0	MCallanan	pizza	Offer: Need a Logo	Closed. Sorry. Big thanks to /u/ToadBacon for his unreal design. Also plan on giving a smaller gift forward to those that tried.   Thanks!   Hey All,  I have gifted pizza on two separate occasions but was hoping to get a little something back this time around.   My fathers drywall business turns 30 years old in January and was wanting to create a logo commemorating the thirty years. A logo I could put on a hat for him a t-shirt and maybe even use on his social media accounts and website.   I've never asked for anything in return when gifting pizzas on here so I'm not really sure how this works. Hope I'm not using any poor etiquette of this sub by doing this. 	1387242055.0

I would really appreciate if you could share a happy picture of you with the pizza when you get it (publicly or just via PM is fine).

t3_1serzz	1386538096.0	Axtillius	shroom	I've never done this before.	My wife and I have fallen on a really hard week. We are not quite sure how we are gonna make it to work tomorrow. But, I had a friend suggest this to me. I've never posted here before, and in hopes that it works, I'd like to feed my small family tonight. I'm normally low-carb, but the one thing I REALLY miss is pizza. I hate the idea of asking for help, but I'm running out of options. I'm not even sure how this works, honestly, but I wouldn't mind blowing my carb count for something delicious. Random strangers, could you help a brother out? I know this is the wrong time of year to ask for favors, as money is tight, and any other circumstance, I would never ask to begin with. A man who can't even afford to feed his own family, makes me feel very depressed. I hate to do this, but, it's kinda my last option. I'm not happy about this post, but if it comes through, I don't know what my reaction will be. EDIT: We both have good jobs, and can normally afford our lifestyle, but we had some unexpected expenses this last couple of weeks that have really crippled our financial situation. I.E.

t3_1scl90	1386459330.0	yumcatburger	shroom	[Request] Dallas, TX - my driveway finally thawed so I can venture out for food... aaaand I'm broke.	**Please let me know if my account isn't old enough and I'll delete right away - the sidebar says 60 days but I seem to remember reading 90 days somewhere. Thanks!  I don't know if you guys have heard, but Dallas is in the middle of Icepocalypse 2013 and we are COMPLETELY freaking out. My driveway finally thawed and so I can get out to get food (nothing in the house really), but I'm broke until Thursday.  I just went permanent at my job, which means I'll have my first real gig with benefits, paid vacation, the whole shebang, but as I'm sure anyone who's gone from temp to perm knows, the payday conversion can be kind of a nightmare. I've got to go three weeks without getting paid (temps get paid every week, permanent employees get paid every two and the way things fell there was a three week gap), and I'm ALMOST there but could really use a break in the monotony of pantry staples. Also, it'd be awesome to celebrate my first real job!  On top of all that I'm in the middle of a fibromyalgia flare which makes cooking rice and beans pretty much the last thing I want to do. If you aren't familiar with the condition, it's a chronic pain disorder and it's kind of a bitch. I'm just exhausted from not sleeping (couldn't get comfortable and cold, wet weather makes it worse - thanks Dallas!) so the little effort it would take to cook just makes me want to cry to think about.  Anyway, if someone could spot me today I will pay it forward once I'm paid! I would sincerely appreciate a little celebratory pizza if anyone would be willing to consider. Thank you!  EDIT: Received! Thank you SO much!!!!	1386460790.0

His dad is newly diagnosed with cancer and he's using a lot of his money to help pay those bills. I had the engine block in car (which I was borrowing from a friend) crack, and I don't have money for rent (I live alone) so I'm probably going to evicted.  This isn't some sob story, its just been a rough week, and its only Tuesday. I'd just like a pizza to split with the boyfriend to hopefully cheer us both up. I'd go buy one if I had the money, just because I feel like he needs one even more so than I do. I'd like the internet to help show him that there are kind people out there :)  **EDIT: I tried paying forward before from last time I got pizza'd, but the guy was a scam account and I didn't really check it before.

t3_1r4cyj	1385012295.0	mcredson	beaker	[Offer] In honor of glinda_da_good_witch and pizzamom (USA)	I am hoping to make this a monthly thing. We will see depending how my wedding savings go. I am making offers in honor of all those great people on reddit. Hopefully, they will PM me and let me know who they choose to give to. Two giftcards up for grabs.      Upvote this offer not for me (self-post, no karma), but for those who give a crap-ton on reddit. This week is [glinda_da_good_witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/glinda_da_good_witch) and [pizzamom](http://www.reddit.com/user/pizzamom). Their history speaks wonders. To enter simply say something nice about BOTH of those users for a chance at a giftcard to the big three (sorry USA only).      Also like to acknowledge all of the other wonderful mods who donate their time and money.

If it was just me I wouldn't have come here asking for a pie, but I have a mom and 9 year old brother that could really use something besides ramen noodles for dinner tonight. I'm in school and I freelance as a linkbuilder on oDesk sometimes. I haven't gotten any contracts lately and my mom hasn't worked since she had a double mastectomy (breast cancer). Like I said I'm going through school at the moment and will get my diploma this summer. I just need to make it a few more months before I can support my family the way that they deserve to be taken care of. I feel better just typing this out. I guess it was kind of eating at me.

I am just a hungry and broke college student looking for that most delicious slice of za on a sunday evening.  Any offers would be greatly appreciated. 	1384759965.0
t3_1qux2v	1384734205.0	IWantToBeNormal	PIF	[REQUEST] (small) - Don't get paid for six days. Could someone order me a medium 1-topping pizza for carryout?	Like the title says.  I am a disabled person who just started a new full-time job earlier this week, but with a new job also comes a dress and hygiene code which required some investment on my part.  I am currently in a pickle with my last few dollars having been spent on deodorant and change for the laundromat.  I do get paid this Friday and I **will** pay it forward with interest on that date either to you or in this subreddit.  There is a Pizza Hut a ten-minute walk from here where I can pick up for carryout, so no delivery charge or tip is necessary.  So here's how it works:  You PM me, I give you their number, you place the order and pay, and I leave to go pick it up once it's confirmed.  On Friday when my check is deposited, I'll PM you back and you can either make the choice of having me order a pizza for you or watch me offer to someone else on here.  And did I mention that my new job is full-time?  That means I can *definitely* afford to take as good care of you as you do to me when the time comes.    I hope to hear from you soon!  Edit:  Nevermind, Pizza Hut won't take credit card orders for carryout.  Guess I'll never eat there ever again.  No other places nearby from where I can pick up for carryout.  Thanks anyway, reddit, guess I'll starve this week.	1384740425.0
t3_1qunm9	1384727275.0	seabass86	shroom	[Request] Just realized I missed my first cakeday. But we all know pizza is better than cake. Anyone wanna help me out? - Chicago, USA	No sob story. I mean, I'm broke, but I'm surviving. I've had pizza on my mind all day. Usually on Sundays I hang out with my brothers and we all chip in for a pizza (by far our favorite food), but we couldn't get together today, so I'm looking forward to a non-pizza dinner (which sucks). I also missed my first cakeday, so I'm hoping I can enjoy a pizza day instead (pizza is at least 10x better than cake and infinitely better than karma, so I realize it's not really an equal trade-off, but I'm hoping you guys appreciate my love of and dedication to pizza).  In exchange for pizza I will share with you my favorite local pizza place that is not commonly known to visitors. So if you ever visit here, you can avoid the usual over-hyped pizza places and experience some super legit pizza. Also, I will share with you my favorite pizza-themed songs.  Edit: As I'm rereading the sidebar I realize that I may have committed a RAOP faux pas. I deleted all of my old submissions from when I first started this account including a previous request from almost a year ago which resulted in me getting pizza'd (it was also not a sob story). Not trying to pull a fast one, my old posts were from before I knew how to reddit good and they were embarrassing (I now realize my redditing strengths lie in commenting).	1384727716.0

I need to get to work so I plan on putting the $22 in my tank tomorrow since I am on an eighth of a tank as is. I have never really been an ask for help type of person but I guess we all are beaten sometimes (beaten but not out). I was referred here using my other account and could use some help.

Had a charge for an item I intended to cancel on Amazon hit my account anyways and won't get the refund for a week. This unfortunately put an overdraft on my checking account.   I was going to order pizza tonight but looks like that's not happening now. If anybody would care to help out I'll be back with an offer next week either when my refund hits or my check does (on Friday).   There's a Pizza Hut two blocks away from my house and I can get a Large for under $10.   I can eat at work the rest of the week but I'm off today.   Thanks if somebody can help.   *EDIT* : Guess I should have mentioned, I live in Kansas City, MO. Not that it changes much since Pizza Hut is the cheapest and closest option (especially since I can walk there) but yeah.   *Edit 2* : Nothing today but anything for tonight (Friday) or any other day is still appreciated and offer to reciprocate still stands. 	1384508924.0

For context, I work a $10/hr temp job at the moment. I haven't been paid yet and I haven't had money for about a week since I made my last car payment. I've been borrowing money left and right to pay for my transportation here, and I've been going all week without eating breakfast or lunch while at work. But I'm especially hungry today for whatever reason.   I don't know how any of this works, and I'm not even sure where or what the nearest pizza place is to my office, but it would make today so much better to have lunch today. I can provide any details necessary through pms. Thank you :)  EDIT: I realize now that it may have been a little late for me to ask for this today. It's 12:15 p.m. my time as I write this, and I'd be ok accepting one anytime this afternoon up until maybe 4? If not today, I definitely be ok with tomorrow also :)  THANK YOU EDIT: /u/pizzamom and /u/my2penniesworth are both amazing and this subreddit is made wonderful by people like them.  	1384457140.0

t3_1qk7ub	1384375439.0	Tinyclayforest	shroom	[Request] VA- Starving artist in a cucumber and I need calories. I'll make you art in return.	I've become your typical starving artist for a few days and I'm really, really hungry.  I owe a school some money, which isn't really much of a pickle (which is why I call it a cucumber) but I'm super-broke right now, and with this school bill, I'm really tight on funds for the week.  It's not all bad though, I'm waiting for my payment to get through paypal and the mail. Paypal takes about 3 days to get my money from my account to my bank and I don't know how long it takes for a check to get from NY to VA.   Anyway, a pizza would be awesome and would give me the energy to keep working on my commissions. In turn for pizza, I will paint (digitally) anything you wish.

t3_1qiand	1384311396.0	ispariz	shroom	[Request] Got lesbo-engaged, paycheck is late, fiancee and I dead tired from work. Help maybe? (Chicago, IL, USA)	Like it says in the title... My GF (we are lesbians) of 5+ years and I got engaged this week because gay marriage FINALLY got passed in our state. We're thrilled! But. We haven't had a fancy dinner...no rings, no nothing... And work has been rough for us both.  And my paycheck is late, which is what would normally be getting us through. We're usually fine, it's just a bump in the road and it sounds so incredible to just sit with the love of my life and nom on a pizza. AND have something to take to work for lunch tomorrow, both of us!!  A pizza would make our night and the rest of the week so much better. Honestly I'm tearing up a little because it sounds so nice to have something other than Slimfast powder mixed with water for dinner.  It hurts living in Chicago, IL, and knowing the best pizza ever is so close yet so far. But even Domino's or Sarpino's would be amazing.  EDIT: Thank you for all the congratulations everyone! It makes us really happy. But we're getting more tired than we are hungry for tonight... There's always tomorrow night, and I don't think finances will be better by then... I'll be able to check Reddit a little at work, but I don't get home until 6:30-7ish. If anyone still wants to make my life even better than it is, comment away :)))	1384320377.0

Few conditions I'll be going by:  * US only (sorry, Canada) * Must have an account for 6 months.   * Prize will be for a large, ~~2-topping~~ 3-topping (thanks, /u/bobcat) Domino's carry out pizza.  **If you can't pick it up, please give others a chance.**     * ~~I'll be ordering online, so be comfortable with providing me with your store information, name, & selection when I PM the winners.~~  Changed to $10 Domino's ecard.    * I'll pick the best 3 CLEAN jokes (rule #2).  No joke, no chance.  Feel free to improve on other's submission. * Contest ends 11/12/13 at 5:00pm Eastern.  If I don't get all 3 out by 7:00, I'll move on down the list.  Good luck, one & all. See you tomorrow.  EDIT 1 5:00pm:  I'm back & reading the jokes you all wrote.  This is going to be tough.  Thanks for making my day so far.  EDIT 2 5:40pm:  Okay, I'm done picking myself off the floor from laughing so much.  Called my credit card company so I don't blocked by fraud prevention.  As /u/bobcat correctly pointed out, Domino's 3-topping carryout is $7.99, so I'm changing the prize and s/he's going to get one.  I've chosen /u/milliemayhem for the best lame jokes (I *love* "groaners"), /u/SarnXero for the most funny jokes (the Thai joke was the best), and both /u/jbrun85 & /u/brickoftr00th for the Dali Lama thread.  I'll be contacting you shortly to get the ecards ordered.  Thank you all so much for the chuckles.  I wish I could have gotten one for each of you.

EDIT #2: We have not yet found a winner but would like to give away a pizza. Rules are a sketch of one of the photos... not photoshop. We think the best thing to do would be to again push out the deadline for contest submissions. **We will pick a winner (or maybe 2) at 5pm EST tomorrow (Sun 11/10/13).** Although the photoshopped ones are damn funny, we would like to stick to the rules we initially set up for the contest.       EDIT #1: This is /u/purplefartmonkey on behalf of /u/novaguy28 - We will be extending the to 11pm EST... he fell asleep after dinner and I don't feel right deciding without him. There are some *awesome* submissions so please keep them coming.   It has been some time since we have held a contest. A move to a new state, looking for jobs and the such will do that. Now that we are back we have a new contest.  We are including three pictures we have taken at random times. We thought it would be fun if you could re-sketch one of our photos or maybe add one of your own design in our likeness. My wife enjoys flowers, monkeys & gem mining, myself poker and the Redskins. This is something we could enjoy looking at for years to come, so please let your creative juices flow!  We will announce a winner(s) this evening - let's say the cutoff for submissions is 8pm EST.

t3_1q811h	1383965558.0	Shadowflank	shroom	[Request] Fell into a rough financial spot for two weeks, paid off all of my loans via /r/loans early, could use a pizza.	Fell into a spot financially where I have less than 5 dollars to spend until the 15th (Even took out another small loan of 40 dollars until then, which was expended once again on cat food and other various things such as another inner tube so I could get to work*). Should have EBT coming in on Monday, possibly, but for the weekend I don't have anything to get by on til then.  So I figured perhaps some /r/loans lurker would perhaps stumble upon my posting and grant myself a pizza, possibly seeing that despite the odds of my loan backstory, I still repaid over 400$ early and on time.  For anyone curious of the 'backstory', I was an employee of Brennan's Incorporated when they shut down in July unexpectedly due to Ralph Brennan, which caused 100~ employees to be instantly laid off.  (*) Instead of my touchpad's pawn shop interest, sadly :(  Edit: I do have a steam key to Pool Nation if anyone wants that in exchange for pizza.	1384028060.0

I've got about $3 and some change in the bank until then, and I'm honestly starting to wonder how I'm gonna be able to eat for the next few days.  I would be eternally grateful if a Redditor could hook me up with some za.  I will post a screenshot of my depressing bank account if need be, I just really need to know how I'm gonna eat.  I want to pay it forward, and I will buy a pizza for another RAOPer in need once I get paid regardless of if I get pizza or not.  Until then, thanks for reading.  Edit: I gotta get going to bed because I work early tomorrow morning.  No offers yet, but if someone feels like helping message me and I'll get to it tomorrow.  I'm sure I'll need the pizza just as much tomorrow as I did today.  Thanks again. :)	1383714239.0

t3_1pt4w4	1383489395.0	capt_badass	pizza	[Contest] Date Night - 25$ e-gift card	OK, so I had a contest a couple weeks ago to post pictures of you and your SO doing something interesting.  I don't like sob stories, I like hearing about happy things going on in lives.  Let's do something a little different this time.  Tell me what the nicest thing you've done for any SO.  Again, gay, straight, bi, dinosaur, I don't give a damn what your current status is.  Just tell me straight up what the nicest thing you think you've ever done for someone you loved.  I'll leave the contest up for a day or two, leave it in the comments or send me a PM.  When I pick the winner I'll update the post accordingly.

t3_1ppn5x	1383339430.0	JadziaK	shroom	[REQUEST] Power cut off four days ago. Would love a hot pizza. (X-posted to /r/food_pantry)	 Hi reddit. Recently our power was cut off, which means we can't use our stove. It's been four days since it was cut off and frankly I would love to be able to eat something hot but unfortunately have no cash to purchase said hot meal until I start my job Monday and start getting paychecks. My husband and I do receive SNAP benefits but we don't get those until Tuesday. If there's anyone out there who could help with just a couple of pizzas I would be forever grateful. Thank you so much.  	1383343418.0
t3_1pn4lc	1383252628.0	realbigfatty	shroom	[Request] New Bedford, MA, USA. Moving tomorrow and haven't had pizza in over a year.	Hello RAOPers. The girlfriend and I broke up last month and I'm moving to Seattle tomorrow. I have $5 in my bank account and nothing to eat, and wont have any money until tomorrow. I'm taking the Amtrak from Boston to Seattle.   Now the big question, "Why haven't you had pizza in over a year?". Well I've been dieting the last 3 years of my life. From July 2010( 800+ pounds) until now (425 pounds) and  I have lost 375+ pounds. I don't know the exact total as I didn't have a scale and the hospital scale only went up to 800 pounds. I made the damn thing error...  I would love to enjoy a pizza for my last night on the east coast. Thanks!  **EDIT: Here's a [pic](https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/66753_10151563218492040_2015621871_n.jpg) for proof of weight loss.

t3_1pmtk6	1383245460.0	synthetic_sound	FAP	[Request] It's been a rough couple of months, so I thought maybe I could request a pie! I've given oodles in this sub, and in return, I can offer you lots of treats! Read on for details... :)	**/edit** - the wonderful and amazing /u/vinyaa was kind enough to send some pizza in my direction. Thank you everyone for reading this, and I am super serious about those terrible drawings - just say the word! :)    Well hi there, all you lovely RAoP'ers! It's been awhile since I last requested, and things have been pretty rough for a few months (broke my foot, and I wait tables, so I've been on a reduced schedule since August, and I've been on a *very* tight budget since). I've given quite a few times here, and will be happy to pay it forward with another interesting contest come Monday! (If you're bored and looking for some interesting reading by the way, check out my last couple of contests here! I asked people for their favorite dinosaurs/favorite random facts, and there were tons of amazing and super interesting answers!)Also, if needed, I would be happy to provide proof of my broken foot! It's taken ages to heal, and it's looking more and more like I'm going to have to have surgery to completely repair it. Fun, amirite? :)  Anyway, on to the good stuff! In return for some pizza, I can offer you a number of treats, in honor of Halloween! I have pictures of my ginger cat, Simba, dressed up and looking rather dapper! Or, I can record a song for you. Or perhaps a voicemail greeting? [Here is one of my original songs, if you would like to hear what my style is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE81J_YX3Ys). I actually just released a new album, and it's free, so if anyone wants the link for that let me know and I would be happy to pass that along, too! Or, I could draw a really terrible drawing for you, of whatever is your hearts' desire! Fair warning though, it will be just terrible. I am not a gifted artist.   And even if you can't donate pizza (I know firsthand just how tight things are right now for pretty much everyone, it's just that time of year), thank you for reading this! And listen, I'm happy to send photos of my dapper kitten to pretty much anyone, just ask. He's too precious for this world, and he's guaranteed to brighten up anyone's day! Actually, I'm happy to do any of the above mentioned treats for anyone, because I'm stuck at home and kinda bored. Maybe instead of trading pizza for terrible drawings, we could exchange terrible drawings...for more terrible drawings!   Thanks again, everyone! Y'all are the best :) 	1383257678.0
t3_1piqoq	1383109192.0	Mittimer	pizza-gold	[Request] Orlando, Fl. Just don't want to cook on my birthday.	Evening (technically morning) RAOP, I'm normally always a giver but figured I would request a pizza. Today, 10/30, is my day of birth. :) My husband and I class until 8 pm tomorrow and I would rather not come home and cook. I don't need the pizza by any means, but it would be appreciated.   We live in an area that doesn't get delivery so a gift card to any of the big chains would be great.   Let me know if you have any questions. :)  EDIT: I will add this, if you need verification of my dob, I am willing to verify that via pm.	1383112457.0
t3_1pietb	1383099226.0	datcrazybok	datcrazybok	[Offer/Contest] Need someone to talk to. Will trade a whole pizza of slices for a small slice of your reddit time over the next month or so.	EDIT: This subreddit is amazing. More people offered to let me PM them than even asked for pizza. The people I chose, one of them PMed me, and I don't even know if she wants pizza yet. The other, blarglznoflo, CONGRATS, and thanks to everyone I bother over the next few months.   TL;DR You're not getting any pizza if you don't read.   I need some help. Really, I just need someone to listen, and shoot me a reply every so often. And it would help if your replies sounded like... positive, or uplifiting, but kind of cynical and witty, too.  So... I have a fiance, right... She told me years ago that she had this warrant from Oklahoma before we got together. I never really thought much of it, I didn't even know anything about it. Until this weekend.   We went to the lake this weekend, Patagonia. It is down near the US/Mexico border. We took a little bit of weed, because we smoke pot. We've never had a problem before, but... this time, there was a dog out. The dog hit on my car. I was honest with the Border Patrol agent, told him I had a pipe and a small amount of weed.   They were so great. When I realized they were going to arrest me for the weed, I asked the guy to not let my son see them handcuff me. He told my fiance to take my son around the corner, and he put the handcuffs on. Then, he asked me if I was going to be cool, because they really didn't like to be dicks or anything, but they had a job to do. He said if I was going to be cool, they would take the handcuffs off. So, they did. I thought I was going to jail, though, at that point. I would have rather it been me.  THEN, they found my fiance's warrant. They told me that they were going to charge me, confiscate my weed, then drop the charges. They said that if they arrested me for the weed and took her in on the warrant, then CPS would have to come get my son. They said we seemed like nice people and good parents, and that they weren't out to destroy anyone's lives. If Child Protective Services would have had to come get my son, I would have just died.  Anyways, turns out this felony warrant is an extraditable, no bond warrant. She signed a waiver of extradition, so now Oklahoma has 30 days to get her. If they don't, she gets released. If they do, she gets a free trip to Oklahoma and a stay in their prisons while we get this straightened out. Or, Oklahoma can send a form saying they aren't coming, and she gets released immediately.   So, now, I'm a single father for a while. I'm not equipped for this. My fiance is my rock. She is my everything. I don't know how I can possibly make it for 3 days without her. I have to do 30, probably. We're trying to get a lawyer in Oklahoma to plead to lesser charges for her, but I don't know...   I live 1,000 miles away from the nearest family member I have. She's got an uncle in East Mesa, but I don't know him. I've got 2 friends. A couple, so when I go see one, I go to see them both. And they're not exactly easy to talk to about stuff. I'm introverted. Extremely. I come online for my release.   I really just need someone to turn my little envelope orange a couple dozen times over the next few months. Someone I can just log on and type a huge narrative to that I will feel like will give a shit.   I also have another requirement. Another redditor let me vent to him the other night. I told him about RAOP, and attempted to Pizza him. He declined, said he really didn't need it. I told him I would give a pizza in his name. I would really appreciate if if whoever gets pizza would message him and thank him for the pizza, for me.   Last caveat: This is a double offer. Once this is all said and done, I will buy you another pizza, for all of your troubles. I hope to give it to someone who will pay it forward some day. Or, you can donate your second pizza as your pay it forward. Totally your call.   I'm not sure who I'm looking to give the pizza to. I guess I will probably just go off of instincts based on your reply, so I can pizza someone I connect with.   Thanks, in advance, for the small slice of your reddit time.   	1383107922.0

t3_1p1q5m	1382534047.0	DarkStarSabre	shroom	[Request] I Hate My Bank	Long story time folks. Sit down, get comfortable. Find some popcorn.  The story begins on the 1st of this month - where my bank broke the law, took all the money from my account and shoved it onto a credit card with an existing payment arrangement and no notice of default. The following week I spent constantly on the phone with them, resulting in the money being refunded, some more money as compensation for a ridiculously high phone bill, my depression flaring up, my work performance being hit and general lack of trust.  Needless to say an official complaint was raised (and will be going to the Financial Ombudsman), my primary issues being the fact that there was a complete lack of communication that led to this over the period of months. The credit card company never recorded the payment arrangement or passed the information on YET at the same time confirmed it when I called to clarify it. They never sent out any pre-requisite letters. Different members of staff told me different things within two hours of eachother. The left hand had no idea what the right hand was doing and I had to talk to the feet to get things sorted.  All sorted, right? Went to a Warhammer tournament over the weekend, came dead last but enjoyed myself, quite happy and looking forward to the new week.  But wait, it gets better. The following Monday my bank call again, wanting to discuss a complaint. At first they did not know what the complaint was regarding, so had to do some investigation and would call me back. No big, call into work, explain, will go in late.  Then the bank calls back. And they drop the bomb, as it were. The complaint is 100% identical to all the shenanigans that I had thought resolved the previous week. The complaint is a carbon copy of something already resolved and it turns out the very complaints section itself is guilty of the same problems as every other part of the chain. Needless to say I snapped. My depression kicked in and I was off work for 3 days, physically sick and broken.  Now understand, I was on a stage at work due to sickness (yay migraines and depression, eh?). So this absence triggered an investigation though thankfully I did not get the sack. This is good as otherwise it would have been very awkward for me in the future.  Now life's good again. No stress, right?  Guess who called this morning? The Hades-blasted fethers from the bank! My first words? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?   They confirm we have an existing arrangement. They state they do not know why I was listed to be called. I bluntly point out they nearly cost me my job and this is now borderline harassment. Another complaint goes in, more compensation to follow in the next 3 weeks or so...  But yeah. I could do with something other than potatoes or pasta tonight. Pizza and coke would be a much needed stress relief.  *You know, before I go into the bank with a knife.*  - Disclaimer: This is frazzled humour. That is all. Don't panic. Have a towel.  Edit: I'm an idiot. Location is Hull, England. GRARGLEBARGLEFARGLE. And all that.	1382603613.0

t3_1ouiwx	1382293391.0	darkmooninc	shroom	[Request] Been a long year. Respite is nice. (Reno NV)	EDIT: tl;dr - I would write fiction for you in exchange for cheap pizza.  Apparently I got Pizza'd early this year so the flair's next to my name. Which means I can't get rid of it, and no one else will help me out. Oh well. I tried. Thanks folks. I'll just eat watery noodles and know my place in the world.  ---  I work a lot, too much. It's not enough money, ever. Most every dime goes to rent, bills, and enough food to eat one small meal a day, if that. Nothing big. Beans and bread and hot dogs. Lots of spaghetti. One year old daughter eats fine, thank you WIC. Wife eats two meals a day, bland stuff. I get maybe one bowl of noodles a day. Three people on $20k a year for three people is very difficult.  Between medical bills for seizure problems, our room mate ditching out on us, and all this economical turmoil, things have been tough. We don't go anywhere or do anything. I write a lot. I released two novels online, [Broken Cogs](http://www.amazon.com/Broken-Cogs-S-L-Koch-ebook/dp/B00BU1E5V8) and [The Bastard](http://www.amazon.com/The-Bastard-ebook/dp/B00FNVPT5C/) which so far have made me about $14 since March. Which went to rent, of course.  I want to offer my wife a pizza night. No wings or breadsticks or anything fancy. No special toppings. Just cheese and/or pepperoni. Thing is, next four paychecks are already spent and accounted for and we're still in the red. I've asked here before and somehow multiple people helped me out. That was real nice of you folks. I hate to beg. I don't like asking again.  So I thought I'd offer a trade. I'd give you copies of any of my novels or short stories, but no one wants to hear much from an unknown Fantasy/SciFi/Bizarro/Horror author. SO what if I do the one thing I know how? Write. If anyone would be so kind as to help my Pizza Sunday situation, I will write 10,000 words about whatever you want. Whatever in the world you want. Plot, characters, everything. And I'll make it good. Guys on Fivrr are charging $1/100 words or so. Pick a tone, a theme, whatever. I will do romance to sports journalism, gonzo to comedy, horror to erotica, sci fi to fantasy. Anything in between as hyper-realistic or surreal as you like.  Heck, if it's really interesting I'll bump it up to 20k or 30k words.  Thought it'd be worth a try. Either way, thanks. If my bills lower, or my wife gets her disability, or my fiction starts selling, I'll be back to pass it on. Even if you don't pizza me here. I still owe you all. Thanks folks, back to writing.	1382321636.0

t3_1oizda	1381870577.0	kai908	kairii	[Meta] Reminder: This is not a need based Subreddit.	*Reposted (with a few additions) from last month due to being buried.*  Due to some recent confusion and events I feel the community needs a reminder that the key word in RAOP is Random. While need based posts may get attention or garner the goodwill of others they carry no more validity or weight behind them than a person who simply wants pizza. A giver is allowed to choose who they wish to give to for whatever reason they deem fit (within reason).  As stated in the sidebar, we are not a substitute for /r/food_pantry[1] or /r/assistance[2] . If your situation is dire please seek help there.  Additionally the sidebar contains the rules you must follow in order to use RAOP, which, contrary to what some may think, is a privilege, not a right.  Due to the potential for/history of scammers on the board we can and will ban those who we feel are violating the spirit of RAOP.  TL;DR: Need based posts/sob stories carry no more weight than anyone just wanting a pizza.  Follow the rules etc.  Edit: [Snang said it well a couple years ago and it all still hold true.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j7naj/just_something_id_like_to_get_off_my_chest/)	1381870851.0

t3_1obut7	1381629656.0	coralfershoral	shroom	[REQUEST] CA. First time requester; 5 papers, 2 midterms due, missing home a lot.	Hey everyone. I'm a 21 year old student at UC Berkeley. I'm currently working hard on my papers, here is my [to do list](http://imgur.com/WfOLOJp) if you are interested in seeing what I'm working on!  This is my first time making a request post (I have responded to offers before, but never got them). Although I can't afford to pay you (just lost my job on oct. 1), I will repay you with giving you my secret thai mojito recipe that I came up with my chef father!! I like to think up creative ways of saying thanks to people. Wish my dad was here to actually make pizza, but I'm away at college - moved out last year. It's been a really rough week; it was my cat's birthday and I miss her, been missing home a lot, and I'd love a pizza to eat while I continue to hit the books and ignoring the itch to put in GTA V.  I'd be more than willing to answer any questions about what I'm doing, what my situation is, whatever! Even if it doesn't mean pizza, I just enjoy talking to people on here.  Thanks! - coralfershoral  EDIT: I thought of another thing I could do to say thanks! I'm alright with photoshop so I could make a little banner or something for you. If you have no ideas, I'd just make something cute to say thanks.	1381630693.0

t3_1nxe3g	1381172438.0	PortionoftheCure	shroom	[Request] She could never know the pizza wasn't real. (US, MS)	Uh, a summary: attended university from a tent in the woods, found a job and an apartment, finally felt comfortable enough to work on the friendship with my crush, because I've been homeless and musky up until this week. However, the apartment and my phone took all of my first check AFTER I made my first plans with her. I have a bottle of soda, but no food for her pretty face.  We decided on pizza a few days ago, and she just texted me, excited for pizza and a movie at my place (thank you, roommate, for your luxuries).  While I'm totally okay with being honest and poor with her...if that pizza fell into my lap, and I made it through tent-life for 2 months, to end it by having a great night with the girl I've been so scared to befriend until my life was in order...  She'd never know how close I came to giving up. Regardless, my life will really start with that paycheck this week.	1381172867.0

The last week has been nothing but trying, I made a post about it in /r/assistance, but luckily a friend came through for us.  Either way my husband and I would love a pizza to help us unwind. Usually we'd buy one for ourselves, but again, times are tough.   Thank you for taking the time to read this. :D  Edit: I realized after posting that I forgot to tag this with request. I'm not really sure how to fix that. =/ The reddit faq says to delete and re-post, but RAoP says no deleting posts. 	1381089436.0
t3_1nsm71	1380994958.0	ThePhar	shroom	[REQUEST] Starting to hate ramen, no money til next week, want pizza, will make a shitty 15minute game based off whoever buys me pizza? Info inside. <3	Hey RAoP, I'm a indie game developer (mainly programmer/artist) who's working on some solo projects and money has been a real problem the last few weeks. I have no job and finding one on the side isn't working out as well as I would have hoped and the bit of money I make from some "contract work" is barely enough to pay for rent. I've managed to live off top ramen the last few weeks, but I am at a point where I want to throw up at the sight of it and I got no cash until next week, so here I am... begging for pizza on the internet. What a life I live. :P  Since I feel bad asking stuff for free, I thought I could at least make a simple little game for the person who buys me a pizza (or two). The two projects I'm working on are both platformers so I could use the core code and make you a simple platformer game starring yourself and whatever else you want (within reason) and should probably be able to put something together within a few hours to a day/two (depending on scale).  Please, I really REALLY don't want to touch that orange bag of BLAND. I'LL LOVE YOU LONG TIME. <3<3<3  I didn't want to do this, [but you have forced my hand.](http://i.imgur.com/9AX9fAY.jpg)  Edit: Got pizza'd. Good times were had.	1381051092.0
t3_1ns6qv	1380977691.0	Ramza_Claus	shroom	[Request] Me and my grandson are gonna be stuck at home this evening. And we'd love to share a pizza if anyone is willing.	So, my wife and daughter are both working tonight, and that means it's a very rare occurence where I will be watching the little guy. Usually, we swing by McDonald's to eat because I can't cook and he's a bit too young (almost 2 years old) to cook for us. But my wife is taking our car to work, so I was hoping to bring home a pizza for me and my buddy to enjoy over the course of our evening together. But my wife and I are totally broke right now.   If my little buddy and I don't get pizza, we'll be okay.  Our menu will be boring, but we'll still have fun. He loves when I play "Come Together" by the Beatles on my guitar for him. And he loves playing catch with me. Sometimes the cat lets him pet her a little bit, but she's usually got her own cat-stuff to do.   The point is, my little cutie and I will have a great time this evening. If someone wants to make it even more awesome by hooking us up with cheesy goodness, we'll  both be super grateful for it.  I live in AZ, USA. I can drop by any of the big 3 around 3 PM AZ time. After that, we're stuck at home for the rest of the evening.  Thanks for reading!!! Keep rockin!   EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes, everyone! I wish that my grandson and I were sharing a pizza, but that's okay, we have some stuff I can make for us (kinda). RAoP is a cool community and the people here are cool people and they do cool stuff.  And my little buddy Sebastian sends his love and hugs! We're gonna go play catch with his little football. 	1381016866.0

Not the exact right place I know, but more just cheer me up with random links/stories?

t3_1nbfrm	1380384718.0	DarkStarSabre	shroom	[Request] Didn't Want To Do This...But....[UK]	Welp. The chap who said he'd help me out today (last week) doesn't seem to be about and hasn't responded to any messages or anything. It's like he literally disappeared - it's 5 pm now and I had messaged mid day as he'd asked. Perhaps RL came up. It happens.  So wondering if any here would be willing to be a hero and step up where he hasn't? Was kind of looking forward to a pizza tonight for positive karma as a last treat before payday on Monday. It doesn't even have to be from a big chain or heck, not even a pizza as justeat.co.uk is an option as well.  In return will provide cat pictures, paint my face a colour of your choice or even happily proofread and edit literature (making use of that English degree yeah). Or will freely discuss LoL or Warhammer with you. Who knows?   Edit: Long Story time  So, long story short.  My bank decides to forward my credit card to their internal bailiffs. Who proceed to take ALL my money from my bank account except one single penny and put it onto the credit card, screwing over every single bill due to go out this month...  Except, they shouldn't have. I had a payment arrangement set up that I was meeting each month. They never sent out a notice of default or indeed the letter stating it was going to the bailiffs.  Essentially they just took all my money this month, **without** notifying me of anything and broke the law in never issuing a notice of default.   The bailiffs have stated they will refund all the money - but this could be 48 working hours... so I literally have no money or food for up to two days. I literally didn't even get a chance to go shopping before they did this.  In addition there is a complaint going through at the highest level (and believe you me, there **will** be compensation) but until all this goes through I'm looking at unauthorised overdrafts, fees and nothing for the next two days.

t3_1na9jl	1380329073.0	Scoobeus	FAP	[OFFER] Who is in serious need?	I posted a few months ago when I was jobless and negative in cash. No one bought me a pizza and it was terrible. Things are looking up for me. I'm preparing a licensing of an invention with Logitech, got a part-time job and school is going great! My websites are also finally generating revenue so I'm really happy. If you are really in need then let me know, I was eating plain mayonnaise because I hadn't eaten in 4 days and didn't have any food or enough money for school and no one would help. So best story gets a pizza courtesy of someone who has been there more times than once.   :edit: Sent pizza to Defiledxhalo and sending one or two to philo-sopher on the 1st once I get my site pay.	1380337767.0

Lost my job in august and then a week later broke my ankle and leg in six places and needed surgery to correct with screws and a plate. Just after getting off the narcotics, after stabbing pains in my leg, they found that I've a blood clot and now take blood thinners. They (the pills) don't sit well with me and I  have a second prescription to take for my stomach. It's been just about a month that and I still can't be upright for more than 20 mins as my ankle/foot swells and turns purple when it's not elevated. I don't drive and public transportation is insane on crutches so I stay home most of the time.

I'm bored, but I'm also broke. I had a few weeks severance and some savings but they're just about gone. Have just enough to pay rent in October and get another weeks worth of groceries, STILL waiting for EI benefits to start paying (I applied in August).   I can stick up proof, x-ray and EI papers if needed.  Sick of toast + bananas, would love a small piz 	1379964754.0

t3_1m6z85	1378925832.0	WhatTheFuckMan	pizza	[Contest] US Only. $20 gift card. Help me find new music. Winner announced on Saturday.	I like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFjMeOnqAPI), [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bimam2j2gEg), and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmfy_5nAH_U) ... so basically contemporary blues pop? I don't know how to describe it. But something like the above. (*Contemporary*, mind! Nothing before 1990.)  Hint: I chose those songs specifically because I don't really enjoy much of anything else these artists have done.   Rules:   1) The song I like the best wins a gift card to Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut on Saturday morning.   2) Links only, please. Ain't nobody got time for c+ping names.   3) Youtube, preferably, but soundcloud is fine too. No spotify.   4) Enter a max of 2 links/submissions per account.    G'luck!  **EDIT: Winner has been contacted. Awaiting reply.**  **EDIT: Congratulations, Theodinus!**	1379296359.0
t3_1m3zk6	1378827877.0	Noirdeathe	pizza	[Request]: Stone broke. Stuck in financial limbo.	Good afternoon RAOPers!  I am currently stone broke (£3 in my account) and relying on my girlfriends work savings (of which there isn't much and it is dwindling rapidly) for the last two months in order to pay for rent, food and other items (mostly the thrice-damned bills).   I want to treat her with a wonderful gooey pizza for putting up with my otherwise broke ass because nothing spells out love like pizza. We all know that.  Once I am financially stable I will once again happily pay it forward for some other poor, needy soul.  Thanks!	1378828129.0

t3_1m04fw	1378687177.0	destinyisntfree	shroom	[Request] Florida Mom could use some cheering up.	To make a long story short, we are struggling a little.  We have 3 kids (two from a prior marriage) and money has just gotten tighter and tighter.  We receive food stamps but for some reason as yet unknown to me, they are delayed this month.  There is food in the fridge, but nothing really seems appealing in the throws of being depressed right now.  A pepperoni and bacon pizza would hit the spot about now.  I know I have received here before and I hope to be able to pay it forward soon, with some things coming around the bend with some job opportunities.  I would be greatly appreciative if anyone feels kind enough to send some pizza my way.    Papa Johns is open until midnight, so there is still time.  What lead to this is that I have enough points for a 10 dollar papa johns gift card on viggle, though that is not enough for a pizza, would have had to dip into bill money but at least only for a couple dollars.  But then as I was going to cash that out, realized they were out of stock and now am exceedingly depressed because it was just a little thing I was going to do for myself but now I can't.  	1378693521.0

I just started at a new job last week.  This is good news for me, as I will be getting an increase in pay.  However, this is also a bad thing because I started in the middle of a pay period and have to go an extra week and a half until I get paid.  I have no real food in the house, and I have almost -$50 in my bank account due to me unintentionally overdrafting.  I could really use your help!  A hot pizza would make my whole week, hell it would make my month.  I wouldn't have to worry about how I'm going to eat for a couple days, and that would mean the world to me.    I really look forward to hearing from you, RAOP.  Thanks for reading! :)  EDIT:  I forgot to add, once I do get paid, I really want to pay it forward and give other Redditors pizza.  I know how hard it is to be struggling for cash, and I do intend on giving others pizza regardless of whether or not I get pizza tonight.  	1378342808.0

t3_1lckpk	1377803057.0	hendersonmark88	PIF	[Request] Will Code For Food (Round 2)	I posted this over a week ago, and was pizza'd by the wonderful /u/lemonlemonade , however, my situation is still the same, if not worse, so I figured I'd have another go.  I still feel like crap having to do this, but my situation really sucks.  Anyone not in the UK, you can send pizza through http://just-eat.co.uk or I have a dominos that will deliver to me, but they are expensive.  Here's what I posted on my other thread:  I was a self employed, freelance web developer for 3 years until I was recently made homeless. I had to stop trading and sign on to benefits. This was weeks ago, and my claim for benefits still hasn't been approved. I have managed to get myself a flat, but now I'm left with no money and very little food (Been living on noodles/ramen which no matter how much I eat, just never seems to take away the hunger).  If you would be willing to help me out and feed me, I can offer my services in return for your kindness.  I am skilled in xHTML/CSS, LESS, SASS, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, MySQL and the wordpress API. I am willing to do anything from site modifications to custom coding, even PSD conversions. I just need a decent meal.  I am from Knottingley, West Yorkshire, UK.  For anyone wondering how the hell one goes 5 weeks without benefits,  because I was self employed before I signed on, the process is different. The first 3 weeks I just heard nothing from them. When I called and insisted that I was put through to somebody who actually knew what they were talking about, I was told I needed to submit 12 months of business accounts. I did this, and waited another week. I called them, and they still hadn't made a decision and now requested bank statements to prove that the minimal income I had all went on rent and bills. Apparently each time they request information, it allows them to add on to the time they are allowed to keep me waiting...  When I do get approved (I will), I will be due to be backdated up until the 6th of this month, so I'm due quite a bit of money. Once it comes, I will pizza forward the last pizza I got, and anything I get from this one.  Thanks a lot people :)	1377803435.0

t3_1l4298	1377519096.0	jackelfrink	pizza	[Contest] Saturday Aug 31 is International Bacon Day. Bacon themed contest with $80 in total prizes	**UPDATE** *Contest over. Unfortunately I dont feel I can award any prizes at all. Only one person posted a pic at all and that pic did not have any real actual bacon in it of any of the requested forms. Only photoshoped inserts.*  You may enter by posting a time-stamped pic with one or more of the following in it.  * Bacon  * Wearing an article of clothing with bacon on it  * Holding a book by Francis Bacon  * Holding a film staring Kevin Bacon  * Standing in front of a street sign of Bacon Rd, Bacon street, bacon lane, etc  The pic does not have to contain every one of them to win. Bonus points will be awarded for creativity and originality. (Flatliners on laser-disc and three other items would be more points than X-Men: First Class on DVD and all four other items.)  The entry has to be one picture. But if things are blurry and out of focus you can post close up shots to follow up. No fair posting five pics all posted at different times and locations each showing a different item.  The pic must be *OF* you. And time-stamped with your username.  If you come up with some sixth bacon related thing to include in the pic, thats bonus points too. Again, I will reward creativity.  $50 first place and three $10 runner ups get eCards to their choice of the big three. I will decide winners sometime the morning of Saturday Aug 31.  Its my contest so I am permited to be a dick if I want to. I can disqualify anyone I want for any reason I want.	1377956051.0

t3_1ktw4e	1377119366.0	MrRexaw	shroom	[Request] Roommates and I have just spent the last 8 hours in court and are now officially broke and hungry, please help?	First things first, we are not criminals or bad people just college kids who made a dumb decision and have faced the punishment for that bad decision.  Recently my roommate and best friend received the opportunity to go to grad school out of state about 8 hours away, and a month ago he was set to move out, room cleared out, u-haul loaded up, everything was good to go. As a last parting sendoff we walked over to the nearby liquor store bought a beer and walked around the local park close to campus reminiscing on the past 4 years and generally feeling nostalgic. Eventually we ended up at a small building off campus that we used to climb up the fire escape onto the roof freshmen year, so in memory of when we were all young and had just met we went up. Little did we know since it had been years since we had been up there, that the fire escape had recently been rigged with a silent alarm monitored by the campus police, and withing 2 minutes of being up on that roof we were greeted by swarm of officers responding to the alarm. We came down and attempted to explain ourselves to the officers, and even though they were nice and understanding because the city we live in is somewhat in a financial crisis at the moment and desperate for any and all forms of money possible, they ended up taking us in, booking us, and charging us with "Unauthorized climbing of a building", which falls under a trespassing charge. Now though this seems quite unnecessary, I can't deny that it was not unfair, so we were let go and issued a court date in one month. Which is standard and fine for myself, but given that my roommate is about to move out of state, this proves to be an issue.   Fast forward to today, and my friend has driven 700 miles to come back to town for our preliminary court date. We cleaned up, wore ties and made it down to the court house early to be the first in line. None of us could afford a lawyer but we were all advised by a personal family friend to seek out the the prosecutor and try to make a deal. Which we attempted to do, but first we needed the help of the court appointed public defender. We told her our story and how we needed this taken care of today on account that my friend could not afford to take the time off of grad school again and drive the 8 hours to come back and do this again. She listened and seemed sympathetic to our situation and agreed to help us all out, but in order to do so she needed to something from us; $500, each. She told the three of us to go downstairs to the ATM and take out as much money as we could. So in order to get this taken care of in the quickest most efficient way possible, we were able to pool together $1,500, which was nearly all of the money we could possibly get. We handed it over to her, in which she proceeded to pocket it and begin to take on our case. We waited the next few hours outside the courtroom to wait to see the judge, as she worked out with colleagues and such on a deal. Eventually we made it in front of the judge and thanks to the help of this attorney we were able to get off with only paying court fees, which in total were to be another $1,000. We then proceeded to scrounge up this new amount of money; begging to friends, borrowing from family members, and depleting our savings. But we did it and managed to get out of there with a clean record but not much else.   So now we are home and tired from a long stressful day, out $2,500 bucks, my friend is trying to figure out a way in which he can get himself back home and the one thing we could really use is something none of us can even afford, a nice hot pizza. So if anyone out there could find it to help out three completely broke college kids who just went through what could be arguably be called a legal shakedown, you have no idea how thankful we would be! Thank you!  **TLDR: Old college buddies wanted to share a moment of nostalgia with each other before they separated out into the world, ended up being arrested and charged with trespassing, requiring $2,500 in court costs and lawyer fees, completely depleting all of the money they collectively have.**  Edit: Sorry, in Detroit, MI, USA	1377119743.0
t3_1ktmu2	1377112615.0	so817	FAP	(Offer) Pizza anyone?	I've been pizza'd before and thought now would be time to pay it forward... So who wants it? No bs rules or anything like that, just post anything below and I will draw one lucky person to receive a $20 gift card to one of the big 3. The only requirement is that your account has to be at least one month old. First 50 posts will be eligible.   Oh yeah, and for those who love to downvote other posts to try to move yours to the top, don't try it. -_-  I will be using random.org to draw a random name so it would be pointless. Contest closes after 50 posts (I don't feel like copying and pasting more than 50 names to the randomizer, lol).   Good luck!   Edit: I gotta bounce at around 5:30PM (ET) so the contest will end at that time OR after 50 posts, which ever comes first!  Edit 2: **CONTEST CLOSED!!! WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOON..**  Edit 3: **WINNER ANNOUNCED!** I went ahead and added in 51 people (since I miscalculated)... As I said before, I used random.org to draw a winner. The person that is #1 on the list is the winner and I will PM you soon!   [Click here](http://i.imgur.com/KHy5XiT.png) to find out if you've won!   Edit 4: Hmmm I think I just got scammed; something seems fishy about our winner....Messaging the mods.     **FINAL EDIT**: It turns out that the "winner" ***cough*** /u/avaughn70 ***cough*** used a fake account that was created a month ago but only active as of yesterday. He/she deleted the account once I sent out the Ecard. I believe that it was a person who entered in twice (once with a real account and once with this fake account)... It's my fault because I should have been more clear about the rules about having an active account.... Welp, lesson learned.  I will still hold this contest again next week so stay tuned *legit*, RAOP'ers! 	1377123305.0

t3_1kmbv7	1376853880.0	IronTek	pizza	[Contest] $25 Gift Card - Photographic proof that your username best fits you.	Just like the title says, I'll give out a $25 eGift card (so I guess that's Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns -- USA only, sorry) to whomever can produce photographic evidence (of whatever person/place/thing is appropriate) with the date and your username present in the photo, showing the RAoP community why your username was the perfect choice for you.  So, for an original example, a random user /u/catlady12 could produce a photo with her username on paper and 12 cats in it.  That might very well win.  But creativity will count, no doubt!  Speaking of cats and users, given the nature of the contest, /u/I_RAPE_CATS is specifically ineligible from competing in this contest!  The winner will be decided by some combination of upvotes and which one I like best (in the event of an upvote tie or if I suspect some vote manipulation occurred, to provide two examples of when upvotes won't be enough).  Contest ends at 8:00pm Eastern time tomorrow (Monday, August 19, 2013).  Also, the winner will still go through the verification system.  Update: Okay, so I guess I didn't check in on this until 9:45pm EDT.  And DaveLinger and ShreddyNeddy are tied with 11 upvotes each.  We will no go into sudden death overtime where each will choose a number between 1 and 10,000.  I will then go generate a random number at [random.org](http://www.random.org).  Closest to the number wins.  PMs going out to both with these instructions.  Update 2: Notices went out, and my random number was generated ahead of time and sent to the mods, so I can't be accused of playing favorites.  Final: My number was 8997.  /u/ShreddyNeddy wins!

I should receive it on Monday but until then, all I have is tap water and ramen...Can someone help a brother out? Pizza should last me until then and of course pay it forward or back. 	1376787006.0

Hope you all get your pizzas soon!  ------------------------------------  Edit 3: Just a reminder that I haven't abandoned this contest! Winner will be chosen TONIGHT at 9pm eastern. If you have an idea that hasn't been listed in the comments, there's still time to submit!  Edit 4: Alright, haven't had much activity since I first posted so winner is tentatively chosen. I say this because I have a feeling I won't have internet access right at 9pm. But know that one of you won and I'm going to be messaging you ASAP!  ------------------------------------  Alright, so here's the deal. My long-distance boyfriend celebrated his first birthday by himself at his brand new job and was sad to hear from basically no one. So I've decided to turn this birthday around for him by sending him 31 days of gifts - who says you can't celebrate all month ;) - and hopefully when he looks back on this year, he'll have a happier memory to take away from it :)  That said, I am a grad student and my stipend is not phenomenal (but hey, it's money) so all of my gifts will have to be free/very cheap. I'd like as many to be physical gifts as possible, but online gifts could be okay too, depending on what they are. Please help me think of some ideas! The best one will get a $20 e-gift card. Contest ends this Sunday (8/11) at 9PM EST!  Here are some ideas I already have to give you guys a place to start:  * a coupon book with 23 coupons (one for each year)  * going to do my best to find him a Picard birthday card! all about that Star Trek lately * a parody of a song he likes with lyrics written for him (I've done this before. It's not as dumb as it sounds, lol I promise) * he asked me for [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594746370/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) for his birthday. I had already gotten him something else, but since I'm doing this I figure I might as well send it to him for his 8/5 gift - gotta be the biggest one :) * a sexy Dropbox collection (keeping our LDR fun ;) ) * some origami, maybe like Yoda or something * a giant list of reasons why he's so wonderful  Excited to hear all of your ideas! Good luck!  Edit: formatting  Edit 2: Ahh you guys!! These ideas are so great!! I'm still in lab and haven't had time to respond to your comments, but seriously, thanks so much for all the help so far!! Even though there are tons of ideas here, I'm sticking to what I said and am leaving this open 'til Sunday, so please don't hesitate to submit between now and then if you think of something that hasn't been said yet!	1376332930.0

t3_1jnx49	1375589312.0	celticbinne	pizza	[Offer] I really want to buy some pizza for 3 different people here (story inside).	Well, this exact time last year I was couch surfing. I left my hometown the day after graduation to get the hell out of dodge and started college in the beginning of the summer. I got a job as soon as I got here and came to love/hate my co-workers. The majority of them graduated (I'll be a sophomore in the fall) but they really helped me out. I had to send home every dollar possible and I wasn't able to pay for my own living or food expenses. My dad is 65 and disabled so he really had no source of income.  Now, I'm about to get a promotion and am in line for an internship (I had to pass up in the Spring because of money issues..) and a kick ass second job in the fall. Not to mention ROTC really had my back.  So why 3? Well I could bombard someone with 60$ or so worth of pizza. But I had three friends in particular who didn't ask for ANYTHING in return and really helped me out when I was in a bad state. Think of this as me paying it forward and I expect you to do the same. It would be awesome to have 3 people do the same to another person and have a ripple effect.  I'm in the US and it'd be easiest for me to order it for you to pick-up, to have it delivered to your address or a building close by if you're on a campus or something of the sort.   If not I can send an eGift Card but then your order is kind of capped, for example you want two medium pies and bread sticks but it's $24 and I sent you $20.   I'm just looking for someone who is genuine and will do this for someone else as soon as they can. Whether they got short-changed this paycheck, moved to a new town, or whatever the case I know how helpless you feel. Some pizza and good friends helped me out WAY more than you can imagine. Oh and since it's 12AM here (everywhere delivers until 4AM here) if you can't get it tonight, I can order it for you for lunch/dinner/late tomorrow if that works.  EDIT: Orders are being sent, I hope everyone pays it forward! * /u/Kicken is getting a medium 2-topping, breadsticks and large cheese pizza  * /u/DownByLaw524 is getting a medium 2-topping and cheesy bread * /u/juhlee is getting a large cali chicken bacon ranch  I hope you all enjoy! :) pleaseeee pay it forward guys, really, it makes a difference.	1375594390.0

t3_1jn5bk	1375561017.0	TheGreatZarquon	pizza	[Offer] Fortune smiled upon me, and I have an extra $14 in my bank account.	After paying the bills and getting some groceries, I have extra $14 in my bank account. I just quit smoking, and I figure that the best way to make sure I stay on the bandwagon is to use what would have been cigarette money to get one of you a pizza.      So, if I can get a pizza for you for $14 or less, lemme know. I know $14 won't cover a huge pizza, but I'd rather feed someone than buy a pack of smokes.      Edit: Ok dudes, currently holding a PM conversation with the person I'll hopefully be buying pizza for. I guess until further notice, this offer is closed. To those of you still wanting a pizza, remember that this is the kindest subreddit around, so hopefully you won't be waiting much longer. Also, thanks for the kind wishes in my battle against smoking, I really appreciate it.      Double edit: Offer is officially closed.	1375569894.0

Landlord is pissed, but rent is paid, I’m hungry, could really use some pizza. (Toronto, Canada).	Just look for a meal for myself.  I rent the basement, I've had it flood already last month, my floor was replaced by the landlord, now there's all these electrical issues with my room and the house, I now lost my cooking privileges in the basement, and am forced upstairs where the kitchen and stove is absolutely revolting, smokey, and greasy. Dirty people up there.  So upset and annoyed right now. And super behind on my school work. Really could use a breather and some grub.

t3_1jlnc4	1375491747.0	Shnoox	shroom	[Request]Exhausted vet tech too tired to cook and too poor to get food	Work has been really crazy these past few weeks. I'm pretty sure the summer heat is making everyone possessed because I was literally running through the clinic today. I just got home and I have to work a 6th shift tomorrow because a coworker fucked up. If one more person cries on the phone with me I might scream.  Additionally, vet techs and assistants in American make a median wage of $24k a year. With my student loans, it barely gets me by each month.

The turkey guy was so going to be the lucky random 3rd winner, but my sister no crap just came and asked for a huge loan O.o**  So sorry I could only do one extra random bonus pizza. Until next time :)  Edit: OR DOMINOS, since someone said there is no Papa Johns near them.       I don't know if I am asking to much or just wording it wrong. Please reference my reply to                  /u/WhosThatGuru_V2       >Just asking someone to take a picture of something interesting, funny, anything with their username in the            picture? (i.e. on a piece of paper) That is a lot for a free pizza?     I.E. If you think you have a cool car, a picture with your username is a lot? You think your hair is looking          good today, a shot of that with your username on a piece of paper is asking a lot for a pie?      Hopefully that clears things up, I wanted to make it easy, I just listed stuff I like in case you had something.          Lets say you have a Yu Darvish (Texas Ranger) K counter bobblehead, a picture of that with your username      would suffice.       Maybe you have a cool T Swizzle poster hanging in your room... etc.   I will pick a winner by 7PM CST. If you win, I will need your phone #, address (to locate a papa johns via their site) and name to place on the order. So make sure there is a papa johns that you can pick up at.   You will also need to use the verification system linked on the sidebar.   So, whoever post something that catches my eye. If it is a picture, it must have your username shown and todays date (not photoshopped on), if it is a video (lets say a funny Vine) you must state your name or have a sign with your username on it with todays date.  So please post something random, funny, and SFW.   That is all. PS I love   Edit: The items listed below are things I enjoy. So posting a picture involving one of the things below would most likely have me favoring your picture or video over someone who does not have one of the item in their submission. Even if you don't have one of the 5 things listed below, you still have a good chance of winning :) These are just things I like, nothing more, you don't have to involve them in your submission.       1. T Swizzle (Taylor Swift)      2. Frank Sinatra     3. Texas Rangers     4. Cubs     5. Running  Edit: I a word 	1375489992.0

t3_1jhy34	1375370263.0	cambionic	shroom	[REQUEST] My Interactive Multimedia Project For Your Pizza	For quite a while now, I have been nonstop hard at work on an interactive multimedia project called [[6x]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmCqEP2v_Wo) - a double-disc immersive experience with hours of puzzles, "flash films", trip-tools, hallucinogenic visuals, and TONS of hidden features.  Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.  *Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*   The project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.  **So here's the thing:** I'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!  **EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, I understand it's kind of hard to describe.**	1375391768.0

t3_1jdxzx	1375229896.0	2days	FAP	[Thanks]Sorry for not paying it forward as I wanted too...	First off thanks again Throwawaydusk for supplying my pizza last time it was delicious and you made the night. Now unfortunately as I told a lot of people last week about my wallet incident well it got worse. So even though my cash was still in there somehow somebody must have gotten the wallet before the girl saw it after I had left the pump. THey must have grabbed my ATM card and ran when they saw somebody pull up I am not sure. So after I met up with the fine lady she gave me my wallet (I originally didnt check my atm card after my wallet since I figured since I knew who had it she wouldnt be that dumb, I should have in hind sight probably could have stopped the theft) I gave her $20 and a pie and moved on. I got home and noticed that I was missing my atm card, instantly went online and saw it had been drawn dry :(. Lost my rent, bills, car payment a bunch of money. Now the bank is covering it so its not like I am completely screwed but for such large sums it takes 4-5 days to process. I just wanted to let the people here I plan on paying it forward either when I get credited or pay check next week, which ever comes first thanks guys and keep on given!   **EDIT: It was not the girl who gave me back the wallet, I figure people might suspect her but I called her after I met up with her how many cards she counted when she found it, she said she counted only 2 and I have 3. She also pulled up in a Lexus F Sport so I doubt she needed it** 	1375230181.0

t3_1izxkz	1374715691.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] It's my cake day! Let's celebrate...	**CONTEST OVER**  Please read the entire post.  I'm not going to feel bad about disqualifying invalid entries.  I'm asking people to draw celebratory pictures, involving cake in some (SFW) way.  Here's how prizes will work:  - prize is a $10 US egift card to pizza hut, domino's, or papa john's, your choice.  - the first 3 acceptable (by my judgement... basically look like you spent more than 2 minutes of effort on it.  crappy art is ok [seriously, i'm bad at drawing too] but a simple circle labeled "cake" is not) drawings get a $10 card  - the 2 best drawings (as judged by me) by midnight EST tonight (~2.5 hours from now) get a $10 card.  - people are allowed to win in both categories  - one entry per person.  no editing your post to update your drawing (or as a placeholder).  any posts with the edit mark (or that I happen to catch being ninja edited) are disqualified.  that means don't edit for stupid things like spelling, etc. too, because i have no way to distinguish.  - BONUS: each entrant can PM me one guess (only one) as to why I rarely eat cake.  if you are correct AND you otherwise won a prize in one of the categories above, you get $2 extra on your card.  - must have had reddit account for at least 2 months with some minimal level of activity (my discretion), or for 1 month with a significant level of activity (again my discretion).  really good art may get an exception, but don't count on it.  **CLOSED**  Thanks everyone!  I hope nobody minds, but I decided to just give a $10 card each to all the entries (except the nsfw one, sorry :-/, and $12 to the one that guessed right that I don't eat eggs) instead of trying to judge them because I like them all and this way more people get pizza!  If anyone feels strongly offended/bothered that I changed it up like that, talk to me and we'll figure something out :)  **UPDATE** oops, didn't notice that the person who guessed correctly didn't actually submit an entry, so it'll just be 5 $10 cards	1374726579.0

Additionally, I have sent "promises to pizza" to a couple of posters that I intend to keep as soon as I get paid again! Thank you all for posting and I appreciate each and every one of you!  My mother was single until I was 9, and only closer to adulthood did I find out that sometimes she just didn't eat to be able to afford even simple things like milk for me when I was very young. She was, and still is, a great mother.  I'd like to buy pizza for a single parent (mom or dad!). Maybe it will help lighten your expenses for a night and/or provide a nice treat for the kid(s) or at the very least give you a night off of cooking!  There's really no other rules for entry, and I will choose 1 person Wednesday to be the winner. I am pretty busy tomorrow, so you might not actually get the gift certificate until Thursday, but I'll do my best!  Recipient will be chosen by me based upon my own criteria for selecting 1 parent from all submitters, and I apologize in advice for all the single parents I can't give pizzas to (I wish I could!!!)  Good Luck, and know your kid will (hopefully) grow up to appreciate all your hard work, and can still be successful, despite what some rude people would say!!! :) 	1374785911.0

KEEP EVERYTHING EXCEPT PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THIS THREAD.** PM'ing him or any other redditor with a request for pizza is prohibited on /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza and can result in a ban if the mods find out that you are spamming someone's inbox with requests. He is not giving the pizza away, so PM'ing him wouldn't help your cause anyway if I can't see it.   I don't know /u/wil but I'm hoping he will enjoy the creative fan responses and the chance to help me brighten someone's day with cheesy goodness. Thanks for entering!  	1375035111.0

Things have gotten worse.  Now I broke my left foot and right arm is infected from surgery and I 100% can use neither meaning I can not walk, use crutches or wheel myself in my wheelchair.  In short, I am in my apartment until they evict me with no way to care for myself and I need food.  Having a pizza brought to me would be perfect and i could sit it next to me and eat as needed.  It need not be anything fancy at all.  We will have to work out the delivery driver getting in the building and into my apartment but I am sure that can be figured out.

So I've been functionally poor for ages now and I didn't realise how long ago it's been since I had pizza until today where I've been hit with an immense craving. I'm not here to boo hoo about how it sucks to have no cash - so many people here have it so much worse than me and I'm lucky just to be able to keep my shit together to the point where I've got a roof over my head.  Anyway - I'm sick to death of supermarket own brand tins of crap and bread that's a day out of date (But 15-20p so bargain, right?). Allow me to have some pizza and allay my fate.  Also seeing as Pizza Hut keep posting vouchers through my door I figured I'd better ask before I forcible return them to sender with a vengeance.

t3_1i8yav	1373763058.0	novaguy28	novaguy28	[Contest] Novaguy28 @ my wife PurpleFartmonkey Sunday contest---Details inside!	As some of you know, I got in trouble when I was young, paid my dues and have been on the straight and narrow for the last 20 years or so. Something that has always bothered me was the fact that after someone is released from prison, they are not given any tools to rebuild a life for themselves. I was fortunate and had a support system, but many do not. My wife and I created a sub call /r/ExCons and our hope is to provide a place where people can offer advice / support, suggest any community resources that may help, offers to help with resumes / job applications, links to articles, offer an old suit for someone to use for an interview... or just a place to vent. Our new sub is what we are basing today's contest on: We will deliver a large 5-topping pizza from Papa John's to any one in the US who gives us the best ideas, links, resources, offers... anything to help get our sub off the ground.You can either post on our sub or here in the contest. If you post on the sub please include a link so we can check it out!  Our focus is to help people who made a mistake, paid their dues and need support rebuilding a positive life for themselves... so for contest purposes ~ the sky is the limit! We will leave the contest open until 3 pm EST so someone will be able to have dinner on us. US only (sorry) & no PMs for this contest will be acknowledged. This cause is very dear to my heart. It has been tough to get away from the social stigma most of society places upon ex-offenders. Thanks you for participating!  EDIT# 1 Still looking for links for self help for the recently released. Have not seen any yet :)   EDIT# 2 Still trying to think of a winner with my wife....So many great submissions!  Late EDIT: Congrats to ItsBobDoleYo---This person Really did his or her research and followed the rules. Special mention to andimlike and NatureHorsesPot for your submissions. We loved them all.

t3_1hq65e	1373076072.0	SpMxDeezNutz	shroom	[Request] Again? So omfg, this is HORRID! RAoP help! me!	So a few days ago I posted on here for a pizza and did get the hook up! I did also share it with 2 of my friends =)  Thanks again!!  As I said before I have a torn meniscus and payed for it up front with my savings in my bank, well I was expecting a payday today or tomorrow, but my boss cannot pay me until Tuesday.  I work as a server/bartender at a local wine/beer/small plates restaurant and I obviously can't be walking around on crutches trying to serve.  I have a paycheck coming in on Tuesday but I won't be able to work for a good month/two after that so my knee heals up.  The next few months are going to be rough for me, sitting in my room in pain not being able to do anything or go anywhere for work. For now I am worried about the next couple days before the check.  Can anyone make the exception of a two time "pizza'd"???  I will repay kindness any way possible.  Thanks RAoP!  Love you all again and again!! Once my check comes in, someone here is getting a freaking pizza on ME!... for once!  P.S. I am not always this broke. 	1373115863.0

Thanks for looking, and for making this an awesome sub!   **Edit:** Pizza found me, in events unrelated to this sub. Please give to someone who needs it!	1372956132.0
t3_1hlk0m	1372892047.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] Been a while since I've done a game...	**PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE POST BEFORE ENTERING**  Let's have some fun with a sociopolitical experiment.  Hopefully I won't offend anyone with my terminology.  If you are eligible (see rules), enter by posting something funny (keep it SFW) as a reply here to my "reply to this to enter" post.  At the same time send me a PM with your choice of what you will do if you win (option 1, 2, or 3).  ---- **Mechanics**  - You are entering the pizza lottery.  5 winners will be selected.  Winners start with a $10 pizza prize.  - Winners can choose from 3 options for their prize:  1. Enjoy their newfound and well-earned pizza riches (keep the entire $10) 2. Share some of their newfound wealth. (keep $5) 3. Be really generous and give away ALL their newfound wealth (keep $0)  * Being generous pays dividends to the community.  The spirit of giving results in (virtual) others sharing as well, with the following consequences:  1. If you choose option 2 above (sharing half your riches), that multiplies to a $10 card for someone in the community (randomly chosen from the entire pool of entrants, could possibly be you), in addition to the $5 that you're keeping.   (So $15 total for the community) 2. If you choose option 3 above (sharing ALL your riches), those turn into 2 $10 cards for random (could potentially be you) people in the community.  (So $20 total for the community but none guaranteed to you)  * The lottery drawings will be made whenever I get a chance after 11:59pm EST on July 4th.  Entry is open until I gather them together for the drawing, but enter early to be safe.  Results will be announced shortly thereafter.  ---- **Rules**  - What you post doesn't actually matter, I just say post something funny so everyone can get something out of it.  Selections will be random, not based on content of post or votes.  * Unlike some of my contests, discussion (of strategy or otherwise) is welcome and encouraged  * Prizes will be awarded in the form of an eGift Card to your choice of Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Papa John's  * To be eligible you must:  1. be in the US (or willing to accept a US eGift Card as a prize)  2. have been a Redditor for at least 4 months 3. have at least 100 total (comment+link) karma 4. have a reasonable amount of activity in non-assistance subreddits (reasonable is based on my discretion and I will be happy to make exceptions for those whose primary activity is on assistance subreddits but is in the form of providing assistance too, not just requesting.  basically, don't only be here for getting stuff, be giving back to or participating in the reddit community in some way too) 5. Only one entry per person please.  Don't use multiple accounts  * Results will be announced publicly (probably as an update in this post) so people can have fun with the data.  I will try to do my best to anonymize the choices while still providing a winners list and interesting data, but in case I fail in that please don't harass people for their choices, as that will make me less willing to do these in the future.  (And if you get harassed you should definitely report it to the mods)  * People will be disqualified if I have reason to believe they haven't read the entire post (that's mostly from not following instructions).  * No whining about the rules.  If you don't like it, don't participate.  Constructive critiquing about the setup is welcome though.  * I reserve the right to add written or unwritten rules as the need arises.  **SERIOUSLY PEOPLE, READ THE ENTIRE POST.  TWO ENTRIES SO FAR AND BOTH MANAGED TO SHOW THEY HAVEN'T READ EVERYTHING**  ----  **REALLY, READ IT**  ----  **BTW, DID I MENTION?  READ THE ENTIRE POST PLEASE!**  ----  **I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENOUGH BOLD TEXT THAT I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL BAD ABOUT SILENTLY IGNORING ENTRIES AFTER THIS THAT DIDN'T READ.  EVERYONE UP 'TIL NOW GETS A HEADS-UP VIA PM**  ----  **UPDATE:**  As of ~5:50pm EST there are only 7 or 8 valid entries (depending on which way I go on the eligibility of one of them).  If I don't have at least 10 valid entries by the time the contest closes, I intend to reduce the number of prizes to floor(n/2) where n is the number of valid entries.  People upvoting for visibility, and those who entered double-checking that they followed everything the post said (I'm being lenient about timing so they can still fix it) would help make sure we get to 10 valid entries and can have the maximum number of prizes.  ----  **UPDATE:**  The contest is closed.  There were only 9 valid entries in the end, so 4 prizes.  Winners of the primary and secondary drawings have been notified.  I will update later (probably in about a day) with interesting stats (too tired now).  ----  **RESULTS UPDATE:**  Of the entries that sent me an option choice, they were pretty evenly split between option 1 and option 3.  (4 for option 1, 5 for option 3, 1 for option 2).  I was honestly expecting a lot more people to pick option 2.  There were 12 attempted entries before the deadline.  Surprisingly to me, they were all from people who met the karma/age/activity requirements (one was borderline but I allowed it).  3 were ultimately disqualified for not following what the post said.  I PMed a few of the early ones and most of them fixed it, but some didn't even after being notified (I didn't tell them what was wrong).  And one deleted his/her entry altogether, not sure why.   Anyways, that left 9 valid contestants, so in accordance with my updated rule there were 4 lottery winners.  With the contestants numbered 1-9:  The lottery winners were contestants 1, 7, 3, and 8.  Contestants 1 and 3 chose option 1 and kept their $10.  Contestants 7 and 8 had chose option 3.  In the drawing for contestant 7's re-shared cards, contestants 2 and 5 got them.  In the drawing for contestant 8's re-shared cards, contestant 8 got one of them back, and contestant 2 won a second card.  The people who ended up getting pizza were destinyisntfree, angelamm10, Weldhelmet, chhill2, and bileybegia.  In addition, rackpuppy won the drawing but didn't end up getting any pizza.  Papa John's was the clear favorite with 3 of the pizza recipients choosing it, and there was 1 each for Pizza Hut and Domino's.	1373175116.0

t3_1hiv12	1372800029.0	benmk	pizza	[CONTEST] Photoshop fun for pizza. Make my dog look cool.	Totally jumping on the one-man bandwagon that /u/plastic_apollo started, but I thought it was a fun idea to get some photoshop in return for pizza. I've had this [picture of my dog] (http://i.imgur.com/cKRYnCW.jpg) for a while and was just wondering what kind of hijinks reddit could get him into. Preferably something spider-man related since that's his costume, but no specifics other than that. The image itself can be modified or he can be put into some other image, be creative!  About 5:20 EST here so give it about 24 hours to call a winner. Will send a $20 e-gift card for Papa John's, Domino's, or Pizza Hut.  Edit 1: To add to the exposure, I x-posted this in /r/picrequests and /r/photoshopbattles, so I will count entries from there as well.  Edit 2: May not be at a computer later so calling it a little early. Congrats to /u/racheal1991, I choose [your entry](http://imgur.com/a/oG9pB)! It was the first picture in the album that made it for me, the reflection was quite subtle and the photoshop was well done. I will PM you so you can get your pizza!

t3_1hil2c	1372792816.0	plastic_apollo	FAP	[OFFER]You want a pizza, I need photoshop skills for a birthday surprise! Let's make a trade!	My fiance's birthday is coming up (mid-July); he's always gotten a laugh out of the "three wolf moon" meme and subsequent versions of the shirt ([here's the original for reference](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ANCwQnIjL._SX342_.jpg)). I asked him if he'd ever actually wear one, and he said he would....if it was our dog.   [So here's our dog!](http://imgur.com/a/HI9od)  I need your help to create a "Three Eskie Moon" shirt. In that album are three pictures of our dog, an American Eskimo named Albus. I need someone, using photoshop, to cut out those three pics of him as best as possible and photoshop it onto the space/moon background, then upload it to imgur in a high res version. I will then have this printed onto a shirt to surprise (dismay?) him on his birthday. The best part is that he swore that, if he ever got such a shirt, he would wear it to work. Knowing that we don't have Photoshop nor do I know how to use it, he probably figured he was safe.  It's a lot to ask, so I'm offering pizza for your help. The person who makes the 'shop that makes me laugh the most will get a digital giftcard to one of the top 3 (Domino's, PJ's, or PH) of their choice.   PS: You can get creative with the shop, too. It doesn't have to be that specific moon background.   It's about 3:30 EST where I'm at, so I'll let this run until tomorrow morning (July 3), at which point I'll contact the winner and hook them up with pizza by 3 p.m. Thanks RAoP!  **EDIT: I just realized a more appropriate tag would have been [CONTEST]. Whoops! Sorry mods!**  **EDIT2: WE HAVE A WINNER!!!! I wish I could give a pizza to every single one of you that contributed a photoshop of our dog. I have been laughing non-stop since I started this thread, but ultimately, the cheesey prize goes to u/Incoherentrant, [whose rendition of Three Eskie Moon](http://i.imgur.com/0HGbVEh.jpg) has kept me laughing for hours now. SCAMMERS BEWARE: I've already e-mailed Incoherentrant with the giftcard before making this announcement, so don't bother messaging me to steal pizza. Thanks everyone! I can't wait for the T-shirt to come in!**	1372878717.0
t3_1hgtzs	1372728697.0	nickx37	PIF	[Request] Denver, CO hitting some hard times, anything would help!	My gf and I have hit some hard times with her losing her job and then unemployment as well for being physically unable to perform her job due to various hand injuries as a server in a restuarant. She is currently petitioning to have unemployment reinstated due to medical reasons for being unable to perform her job, but until then things are really tight and ANYTHING would help us out right now.   I've been both a giver and receiver in RAOP before and would certainly return the favor again when I am able to reciprocate.

Hello lovely Pizza Givers,  I'm a young gal living in Brooklyn, and I just moved from my cozy apartment into a basement room. I'm very sad to have left what was my home, my cat won't come out from under the couch, and moving down four flights of narrow stairs really made my tummy rumble. After paying for a U-haul and a huge load of cleaning supplies, I'm out of disposable income until my next paycheck, but goodness would I love a delicious, cheesy, pipin' hot pizza.   Thanks to all the kind souls who are putting faith in humanity back into the aether.  LOVE, T.  Edit: P.S. I know this is a blankish account. I'm a lurking sort of lady. If you'd like any further verification from me, I can do that. Also, I'll draw anyone a sketch who asks for one, just for shits and giggles.  P.P.S. OHMYGLOB.

t3_1hdw1l	1372627272.0	JeffBaugh2	shroom	[Request] The check is late for my last gig, and we're down to one pack of ramen. Will repay on Friday.	[Note: I totally forgot to include our location in the title - DALLAS, TEXAS]   Well, this is my second time posting on here, but this time, I have a more legitimate and understandable reason. My brother and I are freelance videographers by trade, and - like all freelancers who start out by the skin of their teeth - I've been living paycheck to paycheck from the gigs I do.    Recently, we did a gig and we were told we'd receive our payment in five day's time, in the mail. It's been ten days. It hasn't shown up yet, we have no money and no food, and our client remains unreachable by either phone or email. It isn't too bad, as we're receiving a couple of down-payments for two projects in a few days time, but all the same, we are very hungry and we've had a pretty stressful couple of days.   If anyone could help us out, we'd love to chill with some pizzas and maybe a two liter of drink. We'd be much obliged, and pay you back in full on this coming Friday. Thanks! :)	1372627621.0

t3_1hba4h	1372519226.0	sugar127	FAP	[Request] Having a crappy week, would love a pizza Sandy Springs, GA	I've been having a pretty crappy week and I want to be completely honest about my situation. I ended up having my wisdom and another back tooth pulled. I didn't feel too much pain while the teeth were pulled, but the following day was HORRIFIC. My lips swelled up which apparently is normal and the entire side of my jaw was in pain. I haven't been able to eat much and ended up losing a day of work because of all of this. The pain and swelling has subsided and today I feel like eating an actual meal that isn't mush. I'm not without food, but there isn't much left in the house. Having to pay for dental work out of pocket was an unexpected expense. You try your best to prepare for situations like this, but sometimes life just happens. My boss informed me yesterday that my hours would be cut in half. I don't know how I'll be able to pay all my bills next month. I knew business was getting slow at work but I never thought they would start cutting hours. I know worrying isn't going to help and I am going to do my best to look for more work.  I've been sucking on tea bags and gargling salt water, which was really fun the first time I did it..so it has been a really fun week. I can still taste tea in my mouth. I'm hoping someone would be generous enough to hook me up with some pizza. It has been an awful week and some pizza would definitely make it that much sweeter. Thank you.          **edit** thank you for the opportunity, I will be walking out the door in a few and won't have a chance to log back in today. Enjoy your Saturday or Sunday wherever you are.  	1372539685.0

I'm offering a free pizza to any of the big 3! **[Edit: Actually I will order from anywhere you want, to provide stranger topping options.

I'm not placing a delivery order even if you offer to tip the driver (some people have said this and didn't tip and then I feel sad) - I will place the order to ensure people don't just randomly make up combos and order a pepperoni. - Please sincerely like the combination you put, otherwise you won't like it :(  That's it!  This is open for whenever, but I would prefer to order it within the next few hours.  Thanks!  Edit 2: I don't know what this says about me, but I'd eat every one of these lol.

t3_1gtjtl	1371850454.0	_redman	shroom	[REQUEST] (Dallas, TX) Short on money, really tired of eating variations on beans and rice every night...	I was laid off in January and have been receiving unemployment since then while trying to find more work, but existing bills wipe out pretty much all of my funds every month aside from basic foodstuffs. My fiancee recently started a plush toy business but it is building slowly and doesn't bring in very much money for us yet. We've been eating variations on beans and rice, potatoes, and stir fry for the last several weeks and frankly we're both really tired of it.  We both tried donating plasma today (there is a company near our house that pays $20 for a first donation), but she's on lithium so couldn't do so and the phlebotomist informed me that I couldn't give because my veins were too narrow. For the first time in months things are looking up--I have three or four good job leads that could be coming to fruition in the next couple of weeks--and we really were hoping to get some pizza as a change of pace.  My fiancee even says she'd be happy to send a plushy as thanks once we've got the money to ship something out--I'd be happy to provide examples of her work via PM if you're interested.  Thanks for looking!  * edit: Should probably add that, while we live in Dallas proper, we live in a very rural part of Dallas and the only major chains nearby that deliver to our area are Pizza Hut and Papa Johns (yes, I know reddit hates Papa Johns).  * edit2: been pizza'd thanks to pineapple_wolf!

t3_1g2xtg	1370907585.0	photography444	shroom	[REQUEST] Arizona USA Not a dollar to my name, but willing to trade some of my mad beading skills for some dinner for my family	EDIT: User IamSeth saved the day!!! Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/  It's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.    In exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.  http://i.imgur.com/4rTLqft.jpg http://i.imgur.com/HVsPqO6.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ycN1RI2.jpg  Thank you for taking the time to read this.	1370925485.0

t3_1fquih	1370464978.0	Defrostmode	shroom	[Request] Pizza or anything else for that matter.	Posting the TL;DR version from my previous post with a little more info.  My wife cheated and left. I hardly see my kids. Lost my house, car and job. Dad kicked me out so I could be homeless. Friend's parents stepped up and said I could crash in their garage. Still not eating often (usually one meal every 2 to 3 days. Last was Monday).   Got news that a job I applied for and was really hopeful of was filled today. A lot on my mind about the job search, being 'homeless', and the debt I'm in.  Really hungry and would appreciate a pie immensely!   My garage accommodations:  http://www.imgur.com/x36BlYq.jpeg   http://www.imgur.com/rGjuNMr.jpeg   http://www.imgur.com/ol8OekX.jpeg  I have seen the people offering to do something. I am not a talented artist whatsoever but would be happy to draw something on my tablet or make a YouTube video of me... making a fool of myself or something.  Edit: to be clear, this all took place in the last year and a half. The being homeless and knowing I am not getting yet another job is all within the last week and a half.	1370465666.0

t3_1ffjtb	1370038778.0	jmarita1	PIF	[Offer] $20 Gift Card	I'm in USA, so I imagine US Only. Not picky about where, but online ordering is ideal and gift card option is essential.  I think too often we're focusing on the negative these days (myself included), so I'm making more of an effort on appreciating the little things.  So, to be entered into the selection, all you need to do is tell me something little that you're grateful for. On your grayest day, what is the simplest thing you do/see/hear that puts just a glimmer of sunshine back into your heart?  I'll start: Pulling a thick, complete sheet of lint from the dryer trap in one fell swoop. Sigh. It is absolutely wonderful.  From there, a winner will be randomly selected (I'm going old school and putting all usernames in a hat) at ~~9 AM~~ 11:00 AM PST 6/1.  *Update: I re-thought my time choice--robbing myself of precious sleeping in time! Also I'm kind of loving this--so many of your responses are definitely things I relate to!*  **I wish I could give you all pizza! The raffle gods have spoken: winner is KingFister! **	1370111304.0

Enjoy your pie!!**  **Thank you everyone for commenting, even if you posted after the deadline. You lit this girl's day up for sure!**  Hello, RAoP, we meet again.   Earlier this month I posted a request in regards to pizza and said I would be able to pay it forward once I received money at the end of the month. Well, the end of the month is here and I have enough money in the bank to give away a pie.    So I'm giving away a $20 gift card to Pizza Hut, Domino's or Papa John's. All that I ask is that you share your favorite comedy skit because I like to laugh. If you can't find a desired skit, a clip of your favorite comedy/comedian will do.  Also please be somewhat active in other subreddits. I think that's a given, though...    I'll choose the lucky person at 12PM Central time (GMT-6) Saturday afternoon. :3	1370136567.0

t3_1f1apz	1369500474.0	relinquospes	pizza	[Contest] Name my kitten.	I have been lurking here for some months and haven't requested or contributed anything.  I cannot be a giftee because there are no chain pizza places who will deliver to me, but there is another way you guys can help me.  My boyfriend and I have a sort of exotic pet zoo going on in our house, and I'm honestly sick of coming up with names for all of them.  Right now I have tons of nameless tarantulas, snakes, monitors, and various other little critters.  My one and only cat got pregnant days before her appointment to be spayed, and my boyfriend has decided to keep one of the kittens because she likes his shoe.  So she needs a name but there's a catch, all furry animals in this house are named after a food item (her mother's name is Sandwich).  Whomever comes up with the most clever food-based name will receive a $20 gift card to the chain pizza place of their choosing.  Bonus points for ironic names for my spiders or dragon names for my reptiles.  Offer ends at 7 pm EST.  [Picture of kitten](http://i.imgur.com/U6xTPGQ.jpg)  EDIT:  Since my boyfriend is the one who decided to keep the kitten, he is taking on full responsibility for her and therefore he gets to choose the name.  I see a lot of names here I love, but the final decision is his and there's one here he likes a lot.  But there's still another hour and a half so keep 'em coming!!  EDIT 2:  Just for clarification, this kitten is a FEMALE.  EDIT 3:  CONTEST OVER!  Boyfriend is currently picking the name and I'll announce the winner very shortly.  FINAL EDIT!!:  The boyfriend has picked a winner: Chalupa submitted by /u/Steamy-Nicks.  I have also decided to give a $10 gift card to /u/_justforyou for the spider name "Arachnus Deathicus", which will now be the name of my Goliath Bird Eater.	1369524684.0

I've had no luck with this thing lately, but I figured I'd give it another go. I just had to make a sandwich out of the end pieces of a loaf of bread, canned chicken, and a can of Manwich. It was not appetizing in the slightest, but hey, a guy's gotta eat, right?  I have a couple packs of ramen, and some other things, but I was supposed to get paid for some work I did a month ago, and I'm still waiting, so a pizza would really help me space these few groceries I have left out.

Just message me. I am very sorry for the pity parade, honestly, however my embarrassment is over weighed by my concerned for my friend and her family. If you have any advice that I can forward to her please private message me. Thank you.**  So here is the situation: I am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start).   **So yes, long term, she will be OK.**  The problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't). 	1369012305.0

I don't have it that bad and I know that, so I want to help someone.  **EDIT** Just so you know, I will surely deliver (no pun intended) I just want to give everyone a fair chance to see this post and to share their stories.

Still, keep 'em coming!!!!  **EDIT3 9:36AM EST** I'm awake and still reading! I had some issues last night with some gift card transactions so hopefully not today! I'm glad this has become a venting thread for big problems, small problems, and everything else inbetween. Lots of stories shared and I try to share words of encouragement. I'm feeling fine and a bit overwhelmed by the outpouring of support but I ask you to redirect it to others. I've been saying this to a few people already but radiate positivity. Smile while walking down the street, compliment strangers on small things like, "nice hat!" "you look great in that color!" etc... The world needs more love and you should give it.   **EDIT4** Things are dying down here... now especially with what's going on in Oklahoma. Or simply because interest has weened.... Anyway I sent out some more gift cards...but that's besides the point. Thank you all for you kind words and sharing your stories! Lots of people didn't request help but simply needed to vent. I'm glad I can still be of assistance! Best of luck, everyone!	1369106606.0
t3_1emjq3	1368962274.0	shhhXdontXtell	PIF	[Request] Birthday pizza in KCMO	Its not my birthday but it is my son's. The pizza actually wouldnt be for him either. He chose McDonald's for his birthday dinner. After paying for his and his siblings dinner, I wont be left with more than maybe $3 that is spendable, as in not already being held for bills. It definitely is not a need but I would absolutely LOVE a pie from papa johns to fill my tummy while the minions enjoy their happy meals. I'm cheap to please as far as pizza goes. A small would be enough- one topping. I am not able to drive because my brain is broken (seizures) and we dont live close enough for us to walk to get the pizza so delivery would be super :)  As I've done in the past, I will try to pay it forward as soon as possible.  **Edit** Thank you, JohnGalt1337.

I've given away $75 in pizza over the last week, but I just paid off all of my credit cards today and want to celebrate again!  I will give away 1 e-card to one of the big 3, most likely Domino's unless you really need something else... to the person who posts my favorite tattoo and/or piercing pic. The gift card will be at least $10, but no more than $25, though most likely will be $25.  I only have 1 tattoo myself, but I really dig good tattoos and piercings.  **Rules:**   I will pick a favorite based on my own liking. I will most likely not pick your submission if its not original content (i.e. some random pic off the internet), for the best chance post a pic of your own tattoo/piercing.

I will accept PM submissions, but please post in the thread that you are submitting PM, so I can reply to something publicly should I choose you as a winner.  **Timeframe:**  I plan to pick a winner sometime Thursday (5/16) late afternoon-ish, and send the gift card out Thursday evening as soon as proper communication can be made.  Good Luck!  **Edit 1:** keep them coming, im really enjoying the sumbissions do far! A winner won't be picked until Thursday afternoon US time. Also, I've decided to add a 2nd prize also in the $10-$25 range. One prize will go to my favorite tattoo, one to my favorite piercing, with the overall favorite taking 1st prize. Yes, it may be possible for one submission to win both, but that might be a hard feat to accomplish!  **Edit 2:** It's afternoon where I am, and I've chosen the winners! I decided to award my favorite tattoo with a $25 gift card, and my favorite piercing also with a $25 gift card. And I will be awarding 2nd place in each category with $10 gifts. Winners to be contact soon to arrange award. I will update later with names of winners! Thank you all so much for participating and your submissions, they were all enjoyable and made it a hard decision (hence the extra awards!)  **Edit 3:** Winners are below. $95+ in pizza given out... I say + because one winner is in another country and I don't know how much the transaction is going to cost me yet :) Oh well, enjoy the pizza guys and gals!

t3_1ecf9d	1368570886.0	nikjhig	shroom	Hungry Broke Severely Injured Cyclist.. Spare A Slice? :)	To sum it up, I am a hungry lonely 27yr old cyclist gal in Austin, TX completely broke and severly injured with a broken back(hit on my bike while commuting to work).. will trade 'sexy' emergency room pic for some (vegetarian)pie <3  for the long version, please read below. thank you in advance. ride safe.    hey folks, im an avid cyclist in Austin, TX and was hit head on (they came racing around a corner/blind spot going the wrong way in a one way) this past winter while commuting to work. Needless to say, I was pretty badly roughed up, the worst of the injuries resulting in compression fractures of my spine, with the compressed vertibrates losing around 45% height. Since that time, I was completely bed bound for nearly two months, have been in and out of the hospital, have severely limited mobility, and after a stay in the hosptial last week a new MRI showed that my bones arent healing correctly and have further deteriorated. I found out yesterday that I am going to need back surgery if I ever hope to have my life back. I have so much anxiety given all the risks involved, but need so badly to get back to my life that it seems like the only option. I have no health insurance and have not been able to work since my accident, as I was a bartender and waitress. Since Ive been unable to work I lost my jobs, and have gone completely broke with out of pocket medical bills, an expensive brace and medications, etc. I qualified for 3 months of emergeny food stamps, but since I hadnt been 'looking for work' (I have severly limited/restricted mobility with extreme pain so have not been able to work or, do anything) during that time they wouldnt renew them. Basically, Im hungry lonely and broke. Ive struggled to keep my spirits high over these months, but to be honest, today I just cant shake it. I know pizza wont fix all my problems, but it would sure put a smile on my face and some food in my belly. Thank you for listening, didnt want to go overboard(this long ramble is still a summary) so if you have any questions or want details feel free to ask.   Advice? As a side note, the operation I need done is called Kyphoplasty. Due to my lack of health insurance to have this operation that will hopefully give me my life/mobility back I need to pay out of pocket. The cost of the operation is $5,000. I have never seen that much money in my life :/ I qualified for the Medical Assistance Program of Austin's insurance, MAP, (which has helped with some perscription costs and hospital visits) but also found out today that it wont cover the spine surgery, basically because its not life or death(I will LIVE without the operation, just severely crippled :/.. honestly, im not really convinced that this is living). If anyone has information or suggestions on resources or funding for my situation it would be greatly appreciated. Im pretty overwhelmed and any ideas or suggestions  would be a great help. Thanks guys, sorry to ramble. As you can imagine, Im dealing with a lot of information and emotions right now. Been keeping my head up though. If you have a second but cant send a veg-pizza, please send some positive vibrations and healing energy my way? Thank you. x	1368571526.0

t3_1e97au	1368466016.0	gracebatmonkey	PIF	[Request] Austin, TX USA would appreciate pizza lunch!	You know how it is - end of the month, all the money's been committed, stuck at work and everyone else is eating awesome lunch stuff and you've got nothing but the earlier resolve to just drink water at lunch until payday...which is seeming less satisfying by the minute.  If granted a joyful pizza, I'll be offering a pizza on the 16th in return, because that's how I (pizza) roll.  ETA: whether today, tomorrow, or Wednesday, doesn't matter. I'll be working through lunch, so time is also flexible (say...by 3pm on any of those days). Thanks for your consideration!	1368470165.0

t3_1e0t8j	1368129894.0	damonx99	shroom	[request] Anyone want to help out some kids?	Yes. I already know.  Yes this sounds fake, but's it is not.  My buddy is having a hell of a time with his wife.  She recently got outed as a cheater and blah blah blah...point is, a lot of hard times hit him as of late.  Not to mention a hard cut on hours from his job.  We both have kids in little league and I am taking them all to their game tonight.  We normally try to get pizza for the kids after the game  but times as I said are hard.  Well, my girl gets it and is fine with another sandwich night until payday. (and my fat ass doesn't need pizza anyways).  But his kids on the other hand have been having cereal/sandwich nights almost for the past week or so.   I do what I can to help, but gas/bills/life, it all drains quite a bit out of myself.  So, if anyone feels up to, getting a single pizza for them after their game would be awesome. I know he hates taking charity, so the surprise no take-back would work fine.  PM and I will give you their address info if you want to help.  I am planning to do something myself when I get paid on Friday, but I thought this would really do some cheering up for his kids and by way, him to.  **EDIT**  I forget to mention that they are in Louisiana, Bossier City area.

In any case finals are looming in on me and, while I certainly have a chance to kick their ass and earn myself a 3.0 GPA this semester, I am still nervous.

t3_1djf9y	1367479507.0	OliverTw1st	linkpizza	[META] PLEASE READ!!! Information for Givers/Offerers.	    This post will be updated as needed (updated 11/7/2013)   Your incredible acts of generosity have kept us growing at an incredible pace. In the short time I've been here, the subreddit has nearly doubled in subscribers. We have been featured in several media outlets, numerous /r/bestof threads, and countless person to person referrals of the "magic" that goes on here. All this attention has brought it's share of more incredible givers, new requesters, and just like anything else, dishonest people that are looking for ways to game and scam the system.     **The only real way to combat these lowlifes is with an increased awareness in verifying who you are giving to.**  List of things to look for and best practices:  * **Account Name** - Verify that the person you are intending to give to is the person you are corresponding with. **The easiest way to do this is to PM them first!!!** I personally will not reply to any request related PMs unless I first initiated it. Use the [messages view in your inbox](http://i.imgur.com/mFOTk7Z.png) to help with this. It puts a conversation in a thread, with your portion in green text. The nature of way Reddit is setup allows for easy anonymity among its users. One of the things that makes Reddit great for some subs but troubling for ours is that throwaway accounts are so easy to create. People who are scamming generally create accounts similar to the ones intended to be given to by givers (for instance I am /u/OliverTw1st, a scammer might make an account called /u/0liverTw1st in an attempt to trick the giver.) The vast majority of transactions that occur are by sending e-gift cards directly to the recipient's email address and once they have gotten the e-gift card, it is used almost immediately. **The moderators and admins can't help once the order has been placed, and usually the companies that the GC are ordered through won't offer refunds or reversals onces the GC has been redeemed. If you feel you have been scammed, contact the GC company immediately!**  * **Account History** - Specifically AGE. **Scammers accounts are typically less than a day old, because they were created to look similar to the recipient that they just found out about.** We enforce  a 60 day account age minimum for posts and encourage gifters to use one when choosing a recipient as well.

[**Random Acts of Pizza**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza/) is an amazing community made up of Redditors from all over the globe and all walks of life, brought together by the simple fact that **MOAR pizza makes the world a better place**. RAoP has the most subscriptions of any Random Acts subreddit and is in my opinion one of the top (and easily the most thoughtful) reasons why Reddit is such an awesome social experiment in the digital age. **Our success can be solely pointed to our givers that make our subreddit such an amazing place and their generosity is responsible for helping to restore people's faith in humanity on a daily basis.**   In the year or so that I have been involved with RAoP, I have seen unbelievable acts of kindness on behalf of you all. From the truly random (and sometimes bizarre) request for pizza fulfilled, helping a fellow Redditor who is down on their luck, contests that spark the creatively genius and hilarious entries from participants, and most recently the tremendous out pour of relief during tragedies. We may only make the news from time to time, but I have the privilege of witnessing it every day. I am honored and grateful to be a part of RAoP and **it's people like yourselves that I have to thank for showing me just how amazing humans can be to eachother.**   Thanks for reading this.

t3_1ded5w	1367307315.0	BGoodRBCareful	pizza-gold	[META] Donators, when responding to a PM request, check messanger's comment history to help verify	As a donator, I'll ask the requester to PM pizza choice & personal contact.  When s/he responds, I check their comment history by clicking on his/her highlighted name after "from" to verify I've indeed been contacted by the person I want to donate to.  This helps prevent scammers using similar names to get unwarranted round pies of love.  **EDIT:**  A wise moderator suggested the following:   **You should PM the requester first asking for contact info and pizza choice. If you PM them first, then you don't run into issues with people with fake names PMing you.**	1367329220.0

I'm going to get straight to the point and it's no sob story, just OP being lazy:  My parents are coming home in about two hours from a college class reunion at Virginia Military Institute. My dad attended there from 79' to 83', they asked me to make dinner for them over the phone.  I blatantly decline because I am REALLY not in the mood to make a four-part dinner for my parents' arrival home. So, is there anyway someone can get me a few pies for dinner tonight within the next few hours?  Thanks to whoever helps out, you'll be an awesome life saver tonight!  EDIT: It's his 30th class reunion, it was over the weekend for clarification. :)  EDIT 2: I'm in Michigan, just realized I had forgotten that part. My bad.	1367181826.0

Please be a Redditor of over 3 months, please have a valid reason for pizza (and that could be "I'm drinking and want pizza," but please no sob stories), and be willing to get a card to Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's...because they offer them on the internet.  I will close this out tomorrow (the 27th) around noon Pacific and edit the post to indicate who got it.  If I suspect you're a scammer I will ask for verification, btw.  EDIT: US only, because I've had issues with international orders before.  Sorry to all of my international pizza lovers.  DOUBLE EDIT: I'm having to close this early because of an unexpected appointment, but the winner has been notified.

t3_1d75x1	1367034483.0	Ramza_Claus	shroom	[THANKS] to Blackmere for cheesy goodness!	First of all, thank you to /u/Blackmere. I've been going through a rough patch, and this really renews my faith in humanity. The pizza is delicious! My wife says thank you, as well.  It's only $10. But it has had a huge impact on my outlook. Thank you so much, Blackmere. You straight up rock.  I've recorded a pizza song in honor of /u/Blackmere, and I wanted to share it with the RAoP community. I hope you guys enjoy it. I threw it together in less than 2 minutes (based on music from another really cool song I know), and I didn't execute it super well, but I think you'll get the idea for what I'm trying to do:  [The Pizza is Done](http://youtu.be/_wpI1Opm7Tw)  I hope you all enjoy it, and once again, thank you /u/Blackmere.

t3_1d6qvq	1367019785.0	Blackmere	pizza	[Contest] Help me order dinner.	**EDIT 2: The Winners**  I picked Ramza_Claus's Mexicanish pizza. My wife picked chameleon10's Philly cheese steak ~~heart attack~~ pizza. Although, we'll be ordering these next time because she brought home Round Table without asking first. She's inconsiderate like that. ;)  Also, I picked two honorable mentions for the great write-ups they submitted even if I didn't want to order the pizza they described.  Congrats!  ----   **EDIT: WINNERS PICKED AND PM'ed.**  I really liked reading all the pizzas, everyone. I hope you liked the contest. I'll let you know who won when I've completed the transactions.   ----  **The Contest:**  1. Describe what pizza you'd order from Domino's.  2. The first two that I think sound good will get a $10 e-card.   **The Rules:**  Only one pizza description per comment. If there's more than one, it's an invalid entry. If you choose toppings that Domino's doesn't offer, it's an invalid entry. Your first valid comment that describes a pizza is your entry. If you go on to describe other pizzas in other comments, you did that for the hell of it. I will pick the two I like  (that's 1 pizza from two different people) and announce them probably when I order dinner (about 1-2 hours from now). DO NOT PM ME YOUR ENTRY.  **Winning Criteria**  I like the sound of the pizza you describe. Yup, it's 100% subjective. This is all about the 'za. Your personal story will not factor in to my decision (let's keep it light hearted). You have to be in a part of the world I can send an e-card too. I think that's the US only but feel free to let me know if I'm wrong.	1367030045.0

t3_1d1tom	1366851380.0	Therval	shroom	[Request] It's really hard right now but Ohio USA would love some pizza.	It's been a hard few days, and we finally ran out of things to eat, we were chowing on rice a few days ago, haven't had much since. I have never been more embarrassed in my life to ask for things but I would love to be a receiver. My girlfriend and I both left her mothers house for personal reasons. (Nothing at all to do about 8 people living there /sarcasm) We just couldn't take it anymore and had to find somewhere to go. We ended up at my fathers, hunting for jobs like crazy while he only gives us 50 dollars every week and a half if not two to manage our food stock. This week he ran out of money (doing god knows what with it. He tends to drink a lot of alchohol.) on Monday, right before we asked for money for groceries. We had a pound of hamburger and half a bag of rice to last us as much as possible. But.. Alas, feeding two people with that much food wasn't enough, and we are now out of everything until Friday. We have about five dollars to get bread and some peanut butter with.. But, we went to get in the car and one of our tires were flat. Of all the people right? We only need to last until Friday, and a pizza would be perfect for that. Regardless, we live in a re-purposed garage on an air mattress with a house that is only large enough to fit two people in it, in a relationship. My father has a room to himself, of course. We don't want to intrude much into his life. We can tell his is tiring of us being here, and the only job offer I have gotten is one 45 minutes away, and the pay isn't enough to count for the gas it takes to get there and back.. So it's back to looking for me. Just hoping for a random act of kindness, and the moment I get a job, I will more than likely be giving to another. I don't want to sound too needy so I will stop. Haha. Thanks to you guys in advance. Therval. UPDATE: I cannot accept dominos, none are close enough to deliver. Just Papa Johns(assuming) and Pizza Hut.(Ordered here before)	1366853435.0
t3_1d18tc	1366836043.0	m_chamberlin	shroom	[Request] Ohio USA, broke student musician in need of food. I'll write you a song/piece in return.	I ran out of money on my meal card a while back, and finished the last of my easymac/sandwich stuff yesterday. Luckily for me the term is almost over, so I only need to survive for another week. A pizza would really help lighten that burden, and I could stretch it out to last. If you send anything my way, I'd love to write you a song telling you how awesome you are and record it.  Edit: As far as my music, I do orchestral/soundtrack like stuff, and some folk and jazz.	1366847814.0
t3_1d0sw9	1366824799.0	theLBD	shroom	[Request] Brookings, SD, USA, just lost my job, and could use some food	So I'm desperate... I lost my job last week after my boss found out I was moving when the semester ends. Being an idiot, I didn't have very much money saved up. So now I'm really hungry, and have no food, or money. I'll pay it forward when I find work again.  Update: Chaosmosis came through and is just so many kinds of awesome!	1366844439.0
t3_1d09kw	1366809325.0	Bete-Noire	PIF	[Offer] UK only. Random number between 1-100.	Hey guys,  I've been "pizza'd" twice now so thought it was about time I payed it forward! I'm in the UK so can't gift card or anything so you'd have to be OK with giving me your deets, and then hopefully not get asked for the card upon delivery (anyone know any way around this?).  Anyway, I used a random number generator to find a number between 1 - 100, and whoever comments here first with the same number can have anything up to £15 from Domino's or Pizza Hut or justeat.co.uk or something.   If no one has guessed the correct number by 19:00 I'll pick whoever's closest!  Good luck :)   Edit: Just thought I'd do an edit to let you all know I'm keeping an eye on this, and I'll let the winner know by 7pm.  **EDIT 2: Wow, thanks everyone for responding and I wish I could afford more than one pizza :( it's 7pm and no one guessed the exact number but someone was only one digit off so I'm going to PM them now and if they don't respond within the hour I'll update again.**  **EDIT 3: I feel bad for them but the one digit off winner didn't respond to three messages over an hour and a half so I've messaged the next closest person!**  EDIT 4: Well I never knew how hard it would be to give pizza away! The initial winner never responded to my messages, so after 1.5 hours I moved on to the runner up who after half an hour declined the offer as he already ate, so I messaged the NEXT runner up nearly an hour ago and he hasn't responded either and now I feel like it's getting pretty late for pizza?! I'm gonna give this guy another 15 mins and then message the NEXT runner up and see if they still want pizza today and if not see if guy number two wants pizza tomorrow instead :/ Why does no one want pizza?! Haha.  ***LAST EDIT: Finally good news :) After waiting around for anyone to get back to me the initial winner showed up and was still hungry for pizza! The random number generated when I posted this afternoon was 59 and no one got that but the winner was /u/Quashiie who guessed 58, and now has a pizza on the way to him/her :)***	1366838920.0
t3_1cz7pr	1366765843.0	lushelocution	shroom	[Request] Friend of mine has asshole family that empties out his bank account; had electricity turned off and lost all his food.	I wish I was joking about this. I feel so bad for him. My first instinct was to do this myself, but I just recently made a huge moving trip accross states to get the rest of my stuff moved in and it's been a financial nightmare (I work a minimum wage job at the moment.... so money is tight).  It would be awesome if someone could hook him up. He gave me his address but I told him it was for a different reason. :)  Edit: Willing to provide more details/backstory if people would like more. I would also be more than willing to make an illustration in return for the kindness! :) 	1366766329.0

t3_1cvswq	1366659768.0	Kimmikaze78	shroom	[Request] London, Kentucky. Just need a little help until we can get to the local pantry Wednesday.	I am a very happy wife and mother to four children. We just moved which is killing our finances. We are constantly struggling with making it from day to day. I work full time plus overtime.....but I work for salary so the overtime is moot. My husband is struggling with a decision to go through the disability process at such a young age, or to work on a knee that desperately needs surgery but he doesn't have insurance. Applying for disability is a long process and I don't know if we can wait much longer. Anyway, I'd be happy to make it the next couple of days. We are blessed with a little help from food stamps and we have a very generous local pantry. However we're hungry now and the food stamps are long gone, mainly due to a refrigerator that stopped working and spoiled $100 worth of food. (Really hard to stretch $250 over a month's time for a family of 6). We will get pantry food on Wednesday and they even provide clothes. Just need a little help to get by for a couple of days.  EDIT: I'm speechless. [sumpinlikedat](http://www.reddit.com/user/sumpinlikedat) responded immediately when I was being down voted and not expecting even a comment. Looking at the history this is a very kind and generous person. Thank you so much!! Our little ones are going to be so excited tonight!	1366662105.0

t3_1ctwzi	1366588856.0	thetaven	FAP	[REQUEST] (Tennessee) With two weeks left, a pizza would make my ever-loving night.	This is the LAST WEEK before finals for me!  And seeing as I don't have a job for the summer, I'm working 40+ hours a week for the next three (during finals), and study time is at a premium.  If I could just order a pizza quickly instead of having to grocery shop, that would be TERRIFIC!  Today and tomorrow are the only days I don't really have food plans, since I work at the sandwich store where you always eat fresh (I get free dinner every day I work there).  Papa John's is my preference, but I can also get Domino's delivered as well.  **EDIT**:  Well, it looks like pizza may not happen tonight.  However, it would still be welcome tomorrow as well.  **EDIT2**: HUGE thanks to psm321 for offering to send me pizza! I'm so excited!	1366597828.0

Knowing I had over $130 dollars I knew something was wrong.  After looking at my account there were 3 charges to Meijer's in another state that wiped out my account clean.  My bank said there is nothing they could do till Monday.  So I am without money till Monday at best.  I could really go for a pizza :)  I will only want one for tonight, so if I don't get one within an hour I will cancel this request.

t3_1cqmhc	1366463867.0	darkmooninc	shroom	[Request] So I'm told it's worth a shot to ask for pizza.	I don't wanna ramble on about my problems, I'll list them below but it's not a pity party.  Just a simple question: Anyone up for helping with pizza?  Thanks!  **Update:** I got home from work to find a flurry of responses across not just this thread but also the original trees post. [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne) did me a serious solid, not just offer a pizza, but was able to help with enough cash that I can get real groceries for the first time in weeks. [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay) has responded saying he will take care of me too, we corresponded. [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots) messaged me but I haven't heard back.  Now I'm in that weird predicament where I want to accept one of the gifts and have a Pizza today, but where I would feel terrible if all three of these people went through with their gifts. So far, dehOne's looks solid. Now I don't know what to do with the other two. But no responses from them yet and no pizzas. So hopefully I'm good now. This also means I'm well taken care of.  You guys are amazing. My eyes are leaking and I don't know why.  ---  Long story short. Someone on /r/trees posted a picture of pizza. [I complained because I'm hungry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1cqf0p/pizza/) (Which in hindsight I should have just stayed quiet.) This led to posts which I was sent here.  It's 4/20. Smokers everywhere across the country think it's a day to celebrate recreational smoking. I smoke occasionally for severe anxiety and depression problems.  But today I can't. I work all weekend. In addition, we're between paychecks. There's no money on hand, negative $26 debt in my account, and no food on the shelf but a few potatoes and a pack of spaghetti noodles. I won't get to eat a full meal, and I won't get to smoke out casually. But that picture of Pizza is damn tempting, and I'm fighting off hunger pains.  I work 40+ hours a week. My roommate just lost her job and is unhelpful. My wife has medical problems and cannot work, but SSDI has spent months "processing" her. So she has no income for the last 4 years. My medical is nearly $200 a month to account for her medication and our coverage. We just had a baby who is wonderful. With four people in the house, I pay bills and rent and have a little bit of cash left over a month goes to her medical and nickle/dime bills. The smoke I have for my own problems was fronted to me by my friend, and I smoke probably about $20 a month at most.  There are no excuses. A self sufficient man like me should be able to handle my money well enough to take care of this by myself. Due to our situation, though, we have not been able to afford laundry for several months, we haven't bought more than a handful of food a month, and my car will be unusable because I can't afford repairs.  Bad year so far. It would be nice to give the wife something to eat this weekend.	1366472471.0

t3_1cdway	1366029692.0	RageMonkey262	PIF	[Request for UK] Pizza for our 7 year Anniversary	My partner and I will have been together (in person) 7 years tomorrow (April 16).  We meet online while I was teaching in Korea. When I finished my contract, I went home (NZ) for a month before I flew to Sweden to meet him in real life. Prior to that we'd Skype 6-7 hours a day, email and send letters  Life has been really hard. I haven't been able to go back to NZ, we had to go through his family company (no fault of their own) going through bankruptcy, moving country and visa issues.  We left our jobs at the end of January and moved out of London in the hopes that we could find a place to settle down and have kids.  We lived in at our jobs and worked together in a very stressful situations that really began to affect our relationship and health. Another reason we needed to move.  We've found it really hard to find jobs since though we've applied for everything and anything, pub jobs, cleaning jobs anything.  Tomorrow is our 7 year anniversary and we can't afford to do anything. Which is ok, we still have each other and we're getting along really well again despite the pressures and stress of both being out of work and worried sick about money.  Anyhow, a pizza tomorrow night would be well-appreciated. And the favour will be paid forward as soon as we're in work again. __________________________________________________________________  Thank you for your response Lolly, or maybe tack is more appropriate.  	1366108575.0

[Edit:  Fountain, Colorado]  My wife and I live on my social security, and anyone out there on it knows the dates for benefits always suck because it never pays on the same date, always making things bad.  Our families are several states away and they're broke too.  My grandmother sent us cookies a few days ago and that's what we've lived on other than some instant rice.  We even started googling whether we can eat the cat's food.  We usually only eat one meal a day and a pizza would get us so much closer.    I have been pizza'd before in a contest and we gave that away months ago to someone who needed it a lot more than us.   Thank you RAOP.	1365298996.0

I'm looking for new music to listen to while I'm smoking. Key word being NEW. I don't want a list of classic stoner songs. I'm looking for obscure songs that sound awesome or remixes of popular songs can also be good. I like most genres of music but lately I've been leaning toward hip-hop, rap, and some house music. Please limit your list to 10 songs so I can actually listen to all the songs that are posted. I'm basing this judgement solely on my personal opinion of the lists. I'll chose a winner around 7:30EST. If you have any questions please ask!  Edit:Please include artists name and if it is a remix, the name (or producer) of the remix.  Edit 2: just to be clear, these songs do not need to be about smoking. I'm looking for songs that are an experience, rather than just a catchy hook. I would actually prefer if the songs weren't just about smoking weed   Edit 3:Doing this from my phone. Slowly but surely listening to all of these.   **enough downvoting, you savages**  Final edit: sorry guys, i got out of work late. I'm officially done melting my face off. I don't think I want to watch another youtube video again for as long as I live. The winner is /u/youKCme even though I secretly hate you for not posting links :) that basement jaxx track is awesome.

[We keep a small supply for this exact reason] Thanks to the car breaking down this month we have been suffering for almost the last two weeks. We had to purchase an alternator and break pad kits. Luckily we can do the mechanic work.    It would be greatly appreciated if it was possible at all to get a pizza so that my father and I have something different for the next day.  I can submit any proof that you request, Bank screenshot minus censoring personal information of course. Receipts for the break pad kits and alternator. As well as pictures of the Pantry of the supply + Refrigerator   It would mean the world to me.   Thanks, Victory.	1364577512.0

I love to trade, so throw it out there. I don't have video games so free Xbox gold doesn't help. Gift cards/ gift codes are fucking awesome, as I have no credit or debit card. I am especially in love with Amazon, Etsy, and Fab.com. Domino's too.  If one if you happens to have bones, teeth, fur, taxidermy or especially odd things, don't be shy. The weirder the better.  Trade isn't absolutely necessary, just throwing it out there in case something awesome happens.  	1362954603.0

t3_19xygv	1362786570.0	short_lurker	pizza	[Offer] 4 free Papa John's SuperBowl codes to those requested but no response.	Okay I have 4 codes that I would like to give out before they expire.  I see there are a bunch of [Requests] that have never been responded in the last few days and I am offering my codes to you guys who didn't get a response/pizza first.  So the first 4 people who posted a [Request] and didn't get a comment/response in their thread to get a pizza, post your link to your [Request] in this post and I'll PM you a code. Of course you have to be near a Papa John's and also are okay with picking it up or paying the delivery fee plus tip to the driver.  ~~If there is somehow a left over code or something I'll figure something out.~~ (Probably won't happen at this point)   ***edit*** Didn't think the replies would come in all at once, I couldn't even let it marinate.   I've given out ~~3~~ 2 codes so far and there is ~~1~~ 2 left. I am unsure about the ones who posted a request just recently. I would like to give it to someone who posted at least before I put up this offer.  ~~I am gonna wait until 5pm PST to give out this last code which is in about 24 minutes.~~  ***edit2*** ~~About 15 minutes to go~~. And to remind you that if you've already taken advantage of the free pizza of Papa John's, you won't be able to use another free code.  ***edit3*** Update **2 codes** available because of the restrictions mentioned by edit2. Gonna extend the time actually. There are lots of people who has requested a pizza a day or more that never got a response on this subreddit and I really want to give them a chance. So sometime tonight west coast time.  ***edit4 7:27pm PST***  Alright guys, I gave out the last two codes. Been working in the garage the last two hours and been checking this post and thinking about how I should give out the last 2 codes..  I gave them to people who hasn't participated in this random acts of pizza recently and did post a link to their request. But of course there is a chance I gave out those codes to someone who could have easily lurked and snagged one of the 76 codes posted 3 days ago.  I hope it's fair, I think it's pretty fair. I wish I had more codes to give out to everyone else who posted.	1362799665.0
t3_19xpan	1362779054.0	spicyramyun	FAP	[Request]I couldn't think of a clever title.  Can't cook food.	I really couldn't.  I had plenty of funny things to say all day.  Now I am at home and hungry.  I am currently not able to cook a tasty dinner because yesterday when I had my main drain pipe replaced(from cast iron) to pvc apparently the seal was not complete.  This means that whenever I use water there is leaking downstairs.  Not just a trickle either.  THANK GOD I found out about this from washing the few dirty dishes I had at the time and not...less pleasant means.  So I am not creating new dishes due to being unable to wash them.  This means...no cooking.  I spent my available funds to cover the work yesterday.  Anyone want to pie this guy?  tldr Needed repairs lead to no doing dishes, use of toilette or other causes for water to drain until tomorrow.  Canton, OH	1362792471.0

t3_19qtnd	1362532101.0	instant_japanese	pizza-gold	[Offer] one last call	I'm about to be too narrow on funds to afford doing one of these for a while so i'm going to offer two ten dollar pizza cards to whomever. Be careful with your choice of company along with how soon you need it. I've found sometimes they show up 15 minutes later and sometimes the people don't see them until the next morning.   This is always a terrible process because i find 10 different people who all say they are hungry but I can only support two. So if you want to do something special to stand out, go ahead. If you aren't chosen, please understand. I'm going to step away for about thirty minutes to let the requests come in and if nothing shows anyone above another i'm just going to buy for the first two requests. Make sure to clarify what joint you want it from.   EDIT IMPORTANT: I got a shit ton of messages in a very short period. So many people who sound hungry and/or interesting that I'm going to spend way more money than I intended to. With this last burst it will truly be my last for a little while. Here are the list of names. All of you msg simply with your email adresses and pizza places of choice. And any other things you promised. hint hint kittens. If I didn't get to you, i'm really sorry. But you have to understand a lot of people want pizza. and spending 50 bucks is really way out of my price range but I thought, shit, most of that money would have went to alcohol anyway. Thanks again.  EMAIL ADDRESS AND PIZZA JOINT OF YOUR CHOICE IN THE MSG PLEASE. Saves lots of trouble. Once again, if one of these 5 does not come through in the next hour they will be placed with the next one up. wub wub wub and pizza.    BOOP BOOP:  BoxedCheese, deeter, and ladydean should all have cards on their way. I never heard back from boner sushi (beautiful name) and I tried to get pizza for blargznoflo from two different places but it kept not accepting my information. i'm assuming something weird is going on with the card. so blargznoflo look forward to a pizza in a day or two and I hope the rest of you enjoyed it. blah blah blah blah. fart. <3	1362536635.0

t3_19i6cu	1362195108.0	jakeryan91	shroom	[Request] Pizza would be a nice way to treat Shingles	I am currently in Merced, CA, attending UC Merced, and in my last semester here as an undergraduate. Whenever I get stressed out due to exams (this one brought upon by Physics), my body tends to react rather violently.  After sacrificing the time to finally do it, today I went to the doctor and have been diagnosed with [Shingles] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001861/) [(a.k.a. adult version of chicken pox)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster).   It is not fatal or life-threatening at this stage, but man is it a painful experience, and the medication I have been given, if all goes well, should result in it going away in about a week or so. Got to love modern medicine.  In the meantime I will have quite a bit of downtime in my room working on research and physics hw, and a pizza would be very appreciated. My friend told me about this subreddit and I would be more than happy to pay it forward. I need a reason to be a little happy right now as I work through this pain.

By big three I mean Papa Johns, Pizza hut and Dominos.  **Edit:** Two down, one more to go. :D  **Edit:** All three gift cards are sent out. I wish I could afford to pizza everyone, but I have bills. After I get my car fixed, if we have anything extra, I'd love to hold a contest. And to the three that got delicious pizza, pay it forward when you can.

t3_199qrn	1361901568.0	shdwscrp	pizza-gold	[Contest] Restore My Faith In Humanity	Throughout my past I've always helped those in need expecting nothing in return because it's my belief that the individuals I helped will pay it forward in one way or another.  I started a personal mission a few years back where I take in a homeless person, help them write a resume, get them a suit, and help them find a job. I've been successful on 4 occasions and they are all living fairly awesome lives right now, but as of late I haven't had the time to continue it; Though I do hope to start up again soon.  Over the last 2 months I've given out a total of 7 e-gift cards to various pizza joints to the point where Domino's stopped accepting my orders one day because they thought someone stole my card and was putting fraudulent charges on it. That being said, it should be quite obvious I enjoy helping people.  In the last couple of weeks things have been going downhill (Possibility I may be losing my job in the next few months because of cuts, loss of a friend, etc).   So I ask, please restore my faith in humanity.   *****  **Contest rules are as follows:**  - Write a story of the most selfless act you've done (preferably something you can prove with pictures or something to that effect, but if you don't have any don't let it deter you, a good story is still valid)  OR  - Make a video of helping a random stranger out with absolutely anything, could have been done in the past, but it has to be proven that it's you (i.e. say your reddit username in the video at some point in time).   *****  Top 3 posts (my choosing) will receive a $25 gift card to one of the primary 3 of their choosing.  Contest will close this coming Saturday (March 2nd) at 12:00 PM PST. Results and PMs will be sent out and posted Sunday. RAOP rules still apply and for the love of whatever deity you do or do not worship do not delete your posts. I know others will take solace in your words. Also, multiple submissions are more than welcome, but you can only win once.  For those of you that took the time to read this, thank you. For those willing to participate, I commend you.  Additionally, if I believe that your story/video is tear-jerking enough and you're not part of the top 3 I have no problem rewarding you as well with a $15 e-gift card.  Lastly, if anyone wants to donate to my efforts, please feel free to PM me with what you're willing to part with and if you'd like to help judge.   ***** **Winners**  **^Top ^Prizes**  [Dananator](/u/Dananator) - PAID!

t3_1964tg	1361762106.0	mcredson	beaker	[Meta] Rules and such	Seems like we need to have a reminder of the rules. A full explanation and list of rules can be found in the right. Some rules to emphasize, as they are banable offenses.      * Do NOT delete requests and comments. That includes entries in contests where you won.  * **You must have an account age of one month (where it actually says "redditor for 1 month" in your user page) in order to post.**   * Do NOT PM people for pizza   * Request once every few days   * Do NOT use multiple accounts      Also, a few things that aren't really rules, but are considered etiquette.      * Do not jump on others requests. If you see another request getting fulfilled, good for them, but it isn't a place where you should ask for one from the giver.   * There seems to be a lot of sore losers lately. If you lose a contest, there is nothing a mod can do. Please continue to report contests that never get fulfilled or if something seems off.      Please report any requests that don't meet the age requirement. Please message us if a user is deleting requests. Please report any posts that a verbally abusive or derogatory as it can be hard to check every single comment in the sub.      EDIT: Formatting/spelling	1361803547.0
t3_196006	1361757939.0	Skull-Leader	shroom	[OFFER] A Final Farewell to Here	FINAL EDIT - WINNER was verygoodname  I offer my last offering of pizza in this sub-reddit.  It saddens me where it has gone. . .   I will pick a random winner of my choice when I feel like it in next few days.  All you have to do is post anything (however a story about how you have received or given in past will play a major part).  Especially if PastafarianTwit was a part of it and not these new dictator mods!  EDIT:  Winner will be chosen tonight (Tuesday) when I get home from work. EDIT:  Winner has been notified and once I get info from them I'll announce (so no scammers can try a fake).  It was a hard decision as many good things were written here.  Wish every one the best and perhaps I'll drop in once in a blue moon.  	1362007644.0
t3_195ctt	1361737873.0	brom333	PIF	[Contest] introduce me to a new song/band	So I have been working as a volunteer mental-health therapist for low-income people for the past 6 months and as such, haven't had any extra money. I just got a new job last week and while I haven't made any money yet I would like to pay a pizza forward.  Up for grabs is a $10 E-Gift card to your choice of Dominoes, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  Whoever can introduce me to an enjoyable new song/band I **haven't** heard of before will win! I will select the winner in 24 hours from when this was posted.  I enjoy a broad spectrum of music such as: Girl Talk, Daft Punk, The Bird and the Bee, Pretty lights, Caravan Palace, Parov Stelar, Mumford & Sons, and [jazz like this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=HMnrl0tmd3k).  **EDIT 1**: I will make a strong effort to reply to posts that I **Have** already heard.   **EDIT 2**: links appreciated.   ~~**EDIT 3**: Currently a more than 80  participants who want pizza, but only a few upvotes - that's a weird ratio...~~    **EDIT 4**: There were a lot of great entries and I am very pleased with the results. Because of the diversity of the music, it is difficult to declare a clear winner. As such, I have compiled a list of the best entries and then used [Random.org]( http://www.random.org/) (a random number generator) to select the winner. If the winner doesn’t reply to my PM within 5 hours (enough time to check the contest) then I will use Random.org again and select another winner from the **Runners up** list. Thank you everyone for your participation. It was a blast for me, and hopefully other participants learned of some new music too.    The Winner is: theriddler41!!! Congratulations! I have sent you a PM. You have 5 hours to reply.  **Runners up:**   Teenagegothgirl – [Goldfish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-tNUur2YoU)  have very visually entertaining videos.   Damascius – [Chet Baker - Almost Blue]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4PKzz81m5c)   theriddler41 – [Gramophonedzie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8OEtf5r1U)   cappy321 – Chaos Chaos. I really love the instrumentals and vocals of their song [“My Hands”]( https://soundcloud.com/chaoschaos/my-hands-by-chaos-chaos)   CapoGuy – [Grum – Through the night]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N_yF7I1VIE)   Instame – [Metronomy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PnOG67flRA)    **Honorable mention to:**   MissM00gle85 -  [Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4iLkdaK_uo) had great instrumentals and the lead singer had a great beard, but I just couldn’t get behind his vocals.   gerbillionaire – [Alt-J has very interesting vocals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeMiVU77wo)   philo-sopher – [Bohren & der Club of Gore]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECyfX1OR_nk)   A_Wet_Towel – [Fleet Foxes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSB74LZDNr0)   Ninjakabob – [Kenny Garett]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usnjclLNnTI)   wolf_redrum – [XXYYXX - slow down]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8Q5kzUlim8)    **EDIT 6**: theriddler41 has confirmed.

t3_1953ai	1361729378.0	BeckaBaka	PIF	[Request] Waltham, MA, USA.  Searching for jobs makes me hungry.	I've spent all week applying for jobs.   And I've had plenty of people say that they'd call me in the next few days, and then never call me back.    I've even had one business call to say I was basically hired, and then call back the next day to tell me that they found a better applicant.    I'm sick of the job hunt.  But I know that I must go on, as I must pay rent and bills, and feed myself and my pets.  I'm hungry, and all I have in the house is some pasta...  Anyone wanna pizza me?  As soon as I get a job I'll pizza it forward!  Edit:  To be more specific, I haven't just been looking for jobs this week, it's been several months.  I'm just getting really tired.	1361730715.0
t3_194sij	1361715933.0	kramdiw	shroom	[CONTEST] I finally have a little money to pay it forward! $20 to either Dominos or Pizza Hut (no Papa Johns...I don't like them). This contest closes at 11:59:59pm PST Thursday 2/28/13. Many, many details inside!	I've won ~~3~~ 4 contests in the last week or so (~~one~~ two prizes I forwarded to a [REQUEST]) and it's time I ran one of my own! This contest ends when February does (in PST)...at 11:59pm on Thursday 2/28/13. I want you all to have enough time to do it right!  So here it is. I want to see a photo of you re-enacting a scene/still from a movie. It could be a well known scene or something really obscure - it just has to be accurate. The more detail you get right, the better chance you have of winning. I don't care if your props or set dressing is crappy, just include it anyway. I'm interested in the *spirit* of it, not necessarily the artistic quality. Get Creative!  Here's the kicker: I have to be able to verify the accuracy of the scene, so either provide a link to a YouTube clip, a still photo of the shot you're recreating, or be confident that I know the scene by heart! If I can't verify it without buying/renting the movie, I'll move on to the next one. ___ **THE RULES**  **UPDATED**  1. It has to be an English language movie (any age is fine) 2. ~~There have to be *at least* 2 people in the photo.~~ One person is fine. (The more the merrier!) 3. There has to be a 2nd photo (still in costume and "on set") with dated/signed verification. Sorry, you can't use old photos. 4. You will need a [Verification Code](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/) 5. This is *not* "one entry per person"...you know the deadline, do as many as you can do! 6. ~~BUT...only ONE pic/scene per movie.~~ You may ~~not~~ submit two photos for two different scenes from the same movie.  **<edit>**  7. **There must be at least 5 submissions, otherwise I cancel the contest. Gotta have at least a** ***little*** **competition, right?**  **</edit>**  8. Have fun!  ___ **Bonus $5 if the winning scene is from one of my top 11 movies!**  FYI, my Top 11 List changes with a somewhat alarming regularity, so don't think that movies I've talked about on Reddit in the past are guaranteed to still be favorites. That's the great thing about favorites...they can change!  (BTW, I have already uploaded an image with the list of 11 movies so you know I'm not lying about them! I will link to it when the contest is over and I have decided on a winner, and you will see an unedited post that is about 5 days old.)  TIPS: Choose an easy scene! Remember, it doesn't have to be fancy, just accurate. Bonus points for: involving a lot of people, involving a pet (Only if the scene has that specific animal though. Species is important, breed is not. If the scene has a dog, be sure to have a dog and not a cat. Because they used to use white guys for native americans, etc., you can use a schnauzer for a rottweiler.), or involving the correct vehicle (I mean...if you actually *own* a DeLorean...). Unlike the animal's breed, the cars model is important.  Jeez, I'm starting to wonder how many of you will make it through all of this for a lousy $20!  Anyway, if I have left anything out, or if you have any questions, please let me know! I may make a few minor changes later, depending on the response.  **GOOD LUCK!!**  **<edit>**  **So I guess no one is interested then? If there are still no comments by 7pm PST I'm just gonna cancel it and repost something easier at another time**  **</edit>**  ___  **<edit #2>**  Okay then. No one seems to want to participate in this contest. Consider it closed.  **</edit>**   **<edit #3>**  A late comment let me know there is at least *a little* interest. If 4 others comment that they are planning something by 10pm PST Monday then I'll reopen it.  **</edit>**  **<edit #4>**  **Well...it didn't happen. No one else (save two adventurous pizza lovers) seems to care, so I'm pulling the plug. I may post another contest down the road a bit, but I'm not all that happy with the turnout here, and I don't see the point in another "post your favorite _____" type contest.**  **</edit>**	1361859616.0

t3_192fjn	1361597459.0	_jeth	FAP	[contest]  $15 to one of the big three if you can make me squee!  	So I've given some pizzas and I've gotten some pizzas and now my finances are back in the giving territory and it's time for a contest!    Between now and Sunday, February 24th at 9am CT you may post one (and only one) entry for this contest.  The content of your entry must be a video (short clip please), animated gif, or a pretty effin' adorable picture of some creature doing something cute or funny that will make me squee.  By creature I mean to suggest animal.  Baby humans don't really do it for me, sorry.  Whatever makes my partner and I squee the hardest wins $15 GC to one of the big three.  Must be an active redditor (at least one month of activity on the site and at least 100 karma), only open to US-based individuals or those who can put a US-based GC to good use somehow, and may the cutest, most squee-tastic video/gif/pic win!  P.S.  I have seen a lot of contests lately where people are actually down voting other people's submissions in hopes of raising their own up.  Please, I beg of you, don't be that dude.  Let your entry stand on its own merit.  Thank you for your time.  /soapbox  **Alright, closing up the entries now. We will judge and then report back with a decision today. Thanks. :)  Final Edit:  Alright, my partner had to go to work early so I got to judge these myself which is why it took awhile.  First off, thanks to everyone who participated in it.  This huge volume of squee was exactly what I needed this morning and I will be bookmarking this thread for future squee-usage.  That said, I was going to give away a few different pizzas in a few different contests but the sheer volume of awesome in this one deserved a bit more than a one pizza reward, so I'm awarding three pizzas.  I wish I could award one to each of you because your entries were awesome.  :D  In no particular order, pizzas go to:  /u/kramdiw for the kangaroo/wombat babies post (wombats are one of my animal weaknesses)  /u/potently-potable for the corgi freaking out every time food is offered (and then dragging its bowl off camera like a dead body)  and   /u/Dblueguy for kitten pillow trap (the kitten, clearly, gives zero fucks and continues trying to play)  I am messaging the winners now.  Thank you everyone for your participation and I hope to do this again sometime soon.  :D ** 	1361741956.0

I've given pizza on here a few times so I figured I would give it a try myself. My boyfriend and I lost our cat last night, to what we assume was cardiomyopathy. We didn't even know he had anything... which I guess is the way it goes. He went from being a totally healthy *1.5 year old* cat, to dead, in about ten seconds. I'm actually still replaying it in my mind wondering if could have given cat CPR or something. However, it is what it is. I just don't feel like cooking tonight. Perhaps I will post a picture of him later, though I am at work and feel like I wouldn't be able to control myself for that.  Edit -- I should say, of course I would post nice pizza pictures, including our other cat (who has been whining all day, bless her heart), to thank the person! :]  Edit #2 -- Sorry, this is different from giving pizzas! I am close to a **DOMINOS**, a **PIZZA HUT**, **or a local place** I could give you the number to call and give your card. *I am not close to a PAPA JOHN'S.*  Thanks for considering.

t3_18o5it	1361067603.0	dam360	pizza	[Contest] $20 to your choice of the Big 3!!! (U.S. only)	It's time to play find an awesome shirt for me to judge. Find a shirt you feel I will enjoy and post a verified picture of it being worn. My favorite gets $20 to their choice of the Big 3!!! Here are the rules as follows.  1. Account must be at least 1 month old.  2. Your entry must be verified. Any picture that is not verified will be disqualified automatically.  3. The shirt you are using as your entry must be worn in the picture. I don't want you looking for a shirt on google or finding something out of a magazine. If you don't own a cool shirt, go to Wal-Mart/Target/ any place that sells T-shirts and take a picture. You can also use a person you randomly found on the street.  4. 1 entry per person.  5. If you are worried about the verification covering up the shirt or are afraid of posting a picture of yourself to the internet, you can take two pictures. Have one where you are wearing the shirt without showing your face and another with the shirt on your bed or something, the latter being verified.  6. The deadline is Monday at 8:00pm CT. Any post after that is automatically disqualified.  7. I understand that your surgery failed and as a result you can no longer move any part of your body except your mouth which magically still has the power to consume food. This is a contest and begging will get you nowhere. If you do beg/whine/complain, I will probably just forget your post exists.  Well, I think that's everything. Oh wait, I forgot. My wife loves being a judge of this contest. That being said, there will be 2 winners, one I pick and one my wife picks. Both will receive a $20 gift card. It could also be that my wife and I love the same shirt, in which case that person will win $40. In other words the stakes are high. Here are a list of our interest to give you something to work with.  Husband: I love nerd games like D&D. I also love video games, musicals, and super heroes. My favorite is the Green Lantern. I am also a huge Star Wars fan, as in I have read a lot of the books, seen all the movies, etc.  Wife: I like cute. Or funny. Preferably both. Dumb jokes usually work best for me. I love Harry Potter, Futurama, and comedy movies (Idiocracy and the like).  Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot to this contest. Good luck everybody, and happy hunting!!!  **We are now judging. Any post past this point is automatically disqualified.**  **Thank you everyone for your awesome entries. Unfortunately, we can only pick two shirts, but I shall have you know that we would happily own every single shirt posted. The results of the contest are as follows:**  **Husband: kramdiw**  **Wife: annpanda**  **Thanks again everybody and may your shirts always be nerdy.**	1361239619.0

t3_18fbqf	1360729000.0	StLRedditGirl	shroom	[Request] New to this, not sure how it works	edit [Pizza Received] Thank you SaySheSaid2!    Hi. 35/f, love long walks on the beach, wishes for world peace, etc.      I'm about another month of being poor away from my goal weight but food would be awesome too. Not sure how this works. Just looking for a small pizza (I think that would probably get me a couple of meals) and maybe a soda? My concern though is that I don't have enough cash to tip the driver for delivery and I think carry out has ended. Do these deals work somehow with tip included? If not, I think I would rather pass than not tip.      I get paid Friday so hoping to pay it forward then.	1360853861.0
t3_18ezgk	1360719733.0	dam360	pizza	$20 to your choice of the Big 3 (U.S. Only)!!!	I'm a huge cosplay fan. As a result, this contest will involve you dressing up as your favorite... well, ANYTHING!!! The rules are as follows...  1. All accounts must be at least 1 month old.  2. I understand that your dying aunt left you out of her will and is trying to have your kids sent over to N. Korea to work for cheap labor to pay of your uncle's debt. That doesn't mean I will give you the $20 card. In fact, I will more than likely just forget to read it.  3. You may dress up as anything. If you love anime, dress up as your favorite character. If there's a celebrity you love, dress up as that person. If you like trees, dress up as a tree. The possibilities are endless. I will choose my favorite.  4. The deadline is Friday at 8:00pm CT. Any post after that is disqualified.  5. All posts must be verified. To those who don't know what verifying a post means, it means you have to have the picture include your username. You cannot just find something off of the internet. If you know someone who dresses up a lot, you can take a picture of them. If you dress up a lot, take a picture of yourself. If you aren't either of the above, get creative!!!  I hope y'all have lots of fun with this. Good luck, and happy hunting!!!  **The winner is AllergicToDeath. Congratulations sir.**	1360980056.0

If you wade through my history, you will see that I made an unfulfilled request for pizza three days ago. The only thing that changed between that time and today is that we have less money and less food. It shouldn't be long now before we finally have the dough (pun shamefully intended) to start paying for basic living expenses again. At this time:  * I'm still searching for work (going well) * Wife just got a job (great news, but no paycheck yet) * Our little family is hungry for pizza (extreme ravenous toddler danger)  AND...I will take this further. When the next check comes in, which will be very soon, I will make my own contribution to random_acts_of_pizza. I would like to do a contest, I think. Something CRAZY!  Anyway, dinner would be great.

t3_1893zm	1360516193.0	momwithlupus	PIF	[Offer]  Give a little take a little...	*******CLOSED -- no more submissions.  Was waiting for a couple more people to enter, but I guess they were busy.  Will have my daughter choose her favorite tomorrow evening (2/12 in the pm).  Thanks for all of those who put forth the effort to create something special for my daughter; I'm excited to show her.*********   I know, I know.... I just gave away 3 pizzas the other day, and back for more.  The ridiculous amount of offer threads are making me so happy that I decided to continue the pizza giving goodness (and hopefully inspire even more giving threads).  BUT... I want something in return.  Art, of any form.  But it needs to be Original Content, and something that you've done specifically for this offer.  Requirements:    1) No limit on the reddit account -- I don't care if you're brand new, or 4 years old.  Everyone can play!!  2) Art of any form -- singing, drawing, interpretive dance, a dessert, etc etc.  Let your artistic talent flow!  3) I don't care if you're the worst artist in the world, can't sing a lick, or don't know how to dance.  Just participate and have fun with it!!  Really, I don't even care if you let your toddler do the art for you.  So long as you have fun doing it, that is all that matters to me.  4) I am going to let my daughter choose her favorite.  So, you'll probably want to butter her up.  Her favorite things are: ladybugs, giraffes, pizza, my little pony, littlest pet shop, princesses, dora and dinosaurs.  You'd probably have a better chance if your art included something with these.  5) If you want to personalize it any further, here is some pictures of her for reference: http://imgur.com/a/i8Tqu#pWnkXFE  6) Please include your redditor name on/in the art somewhere, as well as the date.  Thank you!  7) I will let kiddo choose the winner.  Contest will close tomorrow when I get home from work, in order to give a lot of people the chance to play!  Not sure how many I'll be giving away.  It's kind of a go-with-the-flow type situation.  Might be 1 might be 10.  Who knows.  INSPIRE ME!  Also, include with the submission your e-mail and choice of Big 3.   ****Edit:  You can submit earlier works of art, if you'd like.  I want to see all the creativity you have!  BUT, preference will go to those who make something specifically for this offer, as well as those who include their username/date.  Thanks <3 	1360656652.0

Basically they have started enforcing their previous policy. And the first week it started I was late 3 times due to my alarm not working and me not realizing it. When I got the first verbal counseling today, my manager informed me that I was first in the district to get one. Naturally I said "WOO!" which got a slight chuckle and a not something to be excited about type statement. I don't care, I was still #1.  Now onto the offer part. What is something that you have "won" that you really shouldn't be proud or excited about? Offer open for a day or 2. I'll give whenever I damn well please.  *Edit* Offers are out.

t3_1849fz	1360303680.0	kramdiw	shroom	[Offer] 1 Papa John's Superbowl 50% off code...	...goes to the first person who can guess my middle name. I'll be checking back tomorrow (or maybe late tonight), so please post your guess in your own comment (not in a reply) so I can sort by **old** and see who posted first. You know, in case two people get it.  Good luck!  **It's Over**  The **VERY FIRST PERSON** to make an actual guess got it right.

I just moved to Indianapolis while I take a semester off of college from Indiana State and I have no food or drink. I was supposed to get money dropped into my account today from a friend that owes me money from work I did for them but they had difficulties with their car.

t3_181r2v	1360213232.0	Schizo123	pizza-gold	[OFFER] Cheer me up (a difficult task) and you get a pizza	U.S. only and your account must be a month old.   SO I've been really pissed off at life all week. I'm usually anxious about everything but this week I've gotten angry. This is very unpleasant and I would like it to stop. All my usual tactics for getting myself in a more mellow mood have failed. Cheer me up and you get a pizza. You can submit anything you like but here are some hints about what might work and what might not:  Things that are NOT likely to work:  1. Pictures of cats (Sorry, I have nothing against cats but pictures of them do not cheer me up).  2. Shallow truisms.   Things that are MORE likely to work:  1.  A picture taken BY YOU of something I haven't seen before, together with a story of how the picture was taken or a story about the subject matter. 2. A philosophical perspective on life that I haven't considered before (doesn't have to be your original thought; it can be something from a book, but I've read a lot of philosophy.) 3. A story about how you personally have overcome adversity. Not "I stubbed my toe" adversity, but bone-crushing or mentally exhausting adversity.   First person to cheer me up gets a pizza. Maybe the second too. WARNING: This won't be easy. I AM PISSED OFF.   EDIT: Forgot to say that this will be a $15 code to Papa John's. Will probably not be able to get it to you before tomorrow night (2/7/13).   EDIT2: Thanks so much everyone. I feel much better. A "winner" has been chosen and PM'ed. 	1360281503.0

t3_17zvmq	1360155407.0	roxieh	pizza	[Offer] Just got a job! In celebration, I will give you lovely lovers a pizza. [UK, Dominos]	So, I got made redundant before Christmas and was really down on my luck. I was owed two paycheques and didn't have any money for rent nor food. My family helped me out to make sure I didn't get kicked out of my house, and my boyfriend kept me fed and watered.  Whilst I wasn't lucky in my own requests for pizza, I always resolved to myself to bring my good luck forward when I eventually found another job - so here we are! In order to qualify for pizza:  - You have to be an active redditor for at least 1 month  - Not have been pizza'd before  - In the UK  - Down on your luck  Drop a comment here telling me what's up in your life at the moment, who you want the pizza for, and why. It's that simple.   I'll pick one person at around 6.00pm GMT for delivery tonight, February 6th.  It also goes without saying: please don't be an ass and just make something up. There are people out there who could really do with some stranger-cheer in a pizza pie (I know I could have when life kicked me down last year), so listen to your conscience and do something good with it (:  Edit: I have moved the time of choosing to 7pm GMT, to give those getting in from work a chance too.  **Edit 2: juggadan is the lucky pizza winner here, although I really wish I could give pizza to everyone. To the rest of you - may your times improve greatly and may you find all the pizzas in your life that you need.**	1360177192.0

Thanks for the hook up on my [late dinner](http://i.imgur.com/Jr3EsB1.jpg) tonight!!!! just started diggin' In.  edit: i figured i would let everyone know the delivery driver was very happy to accept a PBR and a couple hits off my weed on top of what little change i had for tip. Something I always accepted when i delivered. idk how many people are aware of this. We used to fight over one specific house in boulder because he would always give you some dank and a beer.

t3_17z5oh	1360119798.0	instant_japanese	pizza-gold	The prodigal son returns. 	It has been about six months since I was last here but I have fresh student loans and would like to do a quick kindness. I'm going to give two ten dollar pizza cards out tonight. Anything that makes your post more interesting will be more likely to get you one because I obviously can't buy one for every single person. If you want to do some of my statistics hmwk, that's definitely a plus. It's not hard, i'm just lazy and drunk. But anything to distinguish yourself. I'm sorry if you don't get the card but I can't afford to buy one for everyone. So anyway, two up for grabs. Let the hungry come forth and get fed. I went three days without eating before my money showed up today so I know the feeling. Fire away.  EDIT: i forgot to put offer in the title. if any mods can change that i'd much appreciate it. but if not, it seems people are finding it anyway.    EDIT 2 AND 3 DELETED FOR BREVITY AND THE FACT THEY ARE NOW POINTLESS  Edit: ok apparently one more. only one of the three has reported getting their pizza. i believe the one who received it was one who ordered from dominoes. I think the other two may be pizza hut. I've only had a problem with someone not getting their pizza card one other time and i was out 10 dollars and they were out a meal. so if they come through, please let me know. if not i'm going to have to avoid using these methods for the fact it's money disappearing for no ones benefit. 	1360125423.0

All you have to do to get it, is figure out what song I have "gentleman'd" up.  Here goes:  At your ready, let us commence. I am quite the aficionado of various styles of dancing, you are aware, that I may, temporarily lose sanity when a new song comes over the radio.  I cannot rest, I have to dance a foxtrot.  Yes, that is acceptable.  My lady, you must come take a ride in my horseless carriage, wearing my favorite clothing brand, you can see it most profoundly.  You have brought a bag with a lot of questionable filler, please pass that to your companion, and let us go.  There are a lot of people who are passing glances at me, they all are hoping I will show them my newest dance, because I have good looks.  A Cigar from cuba rests in my mouth, I shall not indulge myself with it, as it is for a fashion statement.  I take a direct route to Miami, creating a feeling that one could describe as sexual, my cardiovascular muscles are so intense, they seem to stretch to infinity.  I have a very large style that I bring to the table.  I have to dance a foxtrot.     You would like to scrap with me? Take care, you have a high chance of failing at what I did not fail at, my lady come closer to me at this public place, we should bathe.  I have distaste for those who disagree with me, they are mad because I have very good seats at our local professional basketball team’s home court, and also directly in the middle of the field for our national football organizations place of business.  I met Muhammad Ali, he told me that I was vastly superior to everyone.  I seem to have a temperature, caused by being able to entertain a large group of people.  The musicians should play another song by myself and my cohorts, whom I regard as royalty.  There are only beautiful ladies in my vehicle, from all directions, my music is widely regarded as popular, Yes.  There is not halt in my future, in any weather or season, I tend to raise the general morale where I am.  I have a very large style that I bring to the table.  I have to dance a foxtrot.     I currently own a Lexus 8 series IS edition, if you are ever in need of a ride, in a vehicle that is convertible, you can telephone me.  I live a life, some would call impossible, I entertain from south street, to 125th street.  Women used to ignore me, and pass me by, now they coming in droves, since I took on a persona liken to that of a sitcom man, I have a lot of jewelry, and I pose the questions, would you prefer to hang out with someone who’s status is greater than others?  You would never see me failing, I would like to play basketball with Shaquille O’Neal, I would be much better than he is.  I am just pulling your leg, people thought I had failed, but I obviously have not.  The lady I chose to spend the rest of my life is beautiful, I got her a convertible for her birthday, I also bought my mother a home in the suburbs of Philidelphia.  Are you trying to stand tall to me?  Do not be ridiculous.  I have to dance a foxtrot.  **EDIT** Yeah, it was Will Smiths Getting Jiggy With it!  code sent to matches05!  Hopefully I can do this again soon!	1360158773.0

Tomorrow, I will buy you An e-gift card to your choice of the big 3. Please pm me with your choice as well as your e-mail. Also, not sure why, but only 2 people posted even though I was late.**  To be blunt, I have been wanting some good reading material. As a result, I decided what better place to find great and original reading material than from reddit. Here's how the contest will work.  1. Accounts must be at least 1 month old.  2. You must post that your are interested in taking part in this contest. I will only allow the first seven people who post to take place in this contest. If by tomorrow at 7:00pm CT seven people have not posted, I will cut it off then. If only one person responds saying they want to participate I will do the contest another day.  3. Once seven people respond, or we reach the deadline, I will randomly select a genre for you. You will then have to write a short story of whatever length you feel appropriate without being longer than 1 comment length that fits into your genre.  4. The deadline to turn in your short story will be one week from tomorrow at 7:00pm CT. If you don't submit it by that point you will be disqualified.  5. I understand that you may have 10 starving children whom you can't feed because your sick and dying aunt is demanding food, however, this is a contest. Posting that you are in such a predicament will not help you win, but might make me forget to acknowledge your post.  That's it everybody. First 7 to comment saying they want to participate have a chance to win a $30 gift card. Good Luck.  **Here are the results of the random genre generator as follows:**  **RockyCoon: Fantasy**  **Weldhelmet: Romance**  **wonderland_lily: Sci-Fi**  **t_l_m: Horror**  **destinyisntfree: Mystery**  **aroracle: Drama**  **LaurenroseV: Comedy**  **You have till two Sundays from now at 7:00pm CT.

t3_17qgeq	1359774126.0	Schizo123	pizza-gold	[Offer] Guess what I am thinking of for up to $30 at Papa Johns. 	U.S. only and your account must be at least a month old.  I made the clues pretty sparse on purpose so that people would have to guess instead of googling for the answer. (Feel free to use google anyway if you want, though). This contest is about luck more than anything. Here are the clues.  1. This is a Russian literary work (could be a novel, short story or play). It is pretty famous but not SUPERfamous, so don't go for the low-hanging fruit like War and Peace.   2. Guess ONE of my two LEAST favorite philosophers. Won't say much about them except that they are both famous and both dead.   If you get one of these right you get $15 at Papa John's. Guess both and you get $30. NOTE: you can take two guesses at either #1 or #2 if you want, but you only get two guesses total.   EDIT: #2 has been guessed as Ayn Rand. (The other one was Heidegger). #1 is still up for grabs.   And #1 has been guessed as well: Notes from the Underground by Dostoyevsky. Thats it. 	1359813469.0

Unfortunately I'm currently unemployed and her job pays a crappy rate under the table, so I can't really *splurge* as much as I'd like. Here's hoping one of you find pizza gods will be able to help.~~  /u/eperiod has gifted me in another thread :)	1359789213.0

t3_17ia3u	1359483130.0	dpapuga	FAP	[Request] Time once again for 'you send pizza, I send beer'	First person to send me an e-giftcard for Domino's gets a 16oz swingtop bottle of my Belgium Ale sent their way. I only have 3 bottles left of this awesome brew.  Update: The beer is still up for grabs  Update: [AAAAAAAAAAND IT'S GONE](http://memegenerator.net/instance/34060114)	1359505865.0
t3_17gsjf	1359422253.0	Schizo123	pizza-gold	[OFFER] I'm thinking of two movies. Guess one and you get 15 Dominos dollars. Guess both and you get 30.	Restrictions: 1. U.S. only (sorry) 2. Must have an account at least a month old.   NOTE: for various reasons I am running this tonight, but if you win you will not get your pizza until WEDNESDAY NIGHT. But you will get it, never fear. If that doesn't sound good to you, don't participate :p.   OK here are the clues - you get exactly two guesses.  1. Both movies have complex, slow-developing plots and (I think) are above-average in length. They aren't terribly obscure either.   2. Movie #1 is based on a piece of classic American literature written between 1875 and 1950.  3. Movie #2 has a religious image/metaphor in its title, although the movie itself does not have a religious theme.    EDIT: This is proving to be tougher than I thought - whoops. I'd rather not add clues now to be fair to the people who have already guessed, but I am going to open it up a bit. Any U.S. redditor with an account over a month old can guess now.   EDIT2 (at 1:30 AM EST): Some very good guesses but nobody has got them. If nobody has guessed the right movies by 11:00 AM today (1/29/13), I will then give a clue that should make them easy to figure out. At that point anyone gets two more guesses even if they have already guessed. So stay tuned!  K Here's two more clues:  4. Both movies came out in 2006  5. Anthony Hopkins played in Movie #1  OK Movie #1 has been guessed: it's All the King's Men.   And Movie #2 is The Good Shepherd. That's it.	1359475856.0

t3_17g6bm	1359405436.0	RorySBarnes	pizza	[Contest] Ever wanted to make a video game? (UK Only!)	Finally, I am in a stable enough financial situation that I can Pizza Forward! So I'm going to. I'm going to in STYLE.  Ladies and Gentlemen of RAOP, I am RorySBarnes, I am an independent games developer, currently at university to improve my skills, and last year I received a pizza in my time of need, and I will now give forward in triplicate.  Tomorrow is Tuesday, and for everyone in the UK, that's 2 for Tuesdays. There are 3 up for grabs (3x2, that is, so, 6 in total) and to win, you must do the following:  Create an idea for a video game.  The best idea will earn you 2x Large Dominos pizzas of your choice (woop woop!) A 1.5ltr bottle of whatever your poison is (soft drink poison, that is...), AND I will attempt to make your vision a reality for either my February or March Game of the Month, as part of my OneGameAMonth attempt!  The two second best ideas will receive 2x Medium Dominos pizzas of your choice. I might use your idea in the future, but I can't guarantee it. D:  You have until 5pm GMT tomorrow to pitch your ideas! GET TO IT!  EDIT: I've had to shorten the contest since I just remembered I am going out tonight, and will not be home when I planned on finishing the contest. Hurry up! There are only 3 entries so far, so it looks like the winners are obvious unless some other people take part! :D  EDIT2: It's 4:30pm, and I'm officially calling it!  First Place: Odd-One-Out, with 20:13!  You win 2 large pizzas of your choice from Domanomnomnominos, a 1.5 ltr bottle of your choosing, and like I promised I will do my utmost to make your game a reality. I didn't imagine that there would be so much effort put into the idea, though, so it's going to be later rather than sooner, but I can assure you IT SHALL BE DONE!  And the runners up, each bagging 2x medium pizzas of their choice, are gak94 (pizza'd!) and robin_hoodie_ (pizza'd!)! I'll attempt to make those two in the future, too!  I'm actually surprised that there aren't many more UK-ers who took part to be honest! It was close! :D I'll PM you separately.	1360505350.0

t3_17cpo0	1359259560.0	dam360	pizza	[Contest] $20 to your choice of the Big 3!!! (U.S. only)	After the success of my last offer I decided I'd like to do another contest, but it would be boring to just do the same thing twice. As a result, I asked my wife for ideas and she came up with a new twist to my last contest. Instead of looking for cars, you're looking for shirts. Here are the rules of the contest as follows.  1. Accounts must be at least 1 month old.  2. All shirts must be worn by a person and verified. If you can't fit the verification into the picture without covering up part of the shirt, take two photos so we will still be able to see the shirt in its entirety.  3. Begging/Whining/Moaning about how I am making you grovel will just get your post ignored. I understand that you might be in a tight spot, but this is a contest, not a charity.  4. Only 1 entry is allowed per person. If there is more than one shirt in your picture, say which one you wish to be your entry.  5. The deadline is Tuesday at 7:00pm CT. Anything posted after that point will not be judged.  6. Unlike last time, you cannot use a shirt from a magazine or the like. I reserve the right to say that your entry doesn't count. To avoid this, go out and actually find a shirt in the real world.  Also, as I said before, my wife helped me come up with this contest and as a result wants in. Because of this, there will be two winners, one picked by me, the other picked by my wife. Both people will receive a $20 gift card. It is also possible that we will both pick the same person as our winner, in which case that person gets a $40 gift card, so the stakes are high. Here is a description of our interests.  Husband: I am a nerd at heart. I love Star Wars and well as D&D and superheroes. I am also a pretty big video game fan. I also love movies, preferably dark movies with a great story.  Wife: I like funny things, mostly. I do like some nerdiness, but mostly jokes. Nerd jokes work pretty well. Or cute things. Or just interesting things.  My apologies for my wife's vagueness. Her exact quote after she typed out the above paragraph was "I wanna confuse them. I can't make this too easy." Anyway, good luck on your journey and happy hunting!  **My wife and I are now judging. Anything posted past this point is automatically disqualified. After some debate, fisticuffs, and various shenanigans we have finally decided our winners. The results are as follows**  **Wife: Tangoberry**  **Husband: Aprilynn**  **I can only be on the internet for a little while longer, so please pm me your e-mail address as well as your choice of the big 3. If I have to leave before we figure everything out, I will get on it first thing tomorrow. Thanks guys for such a fun contest.** 	1359508338.0

I wasn't expecting snow in my area at all this winter, but then it started snowing yesterday as my bf and I drove to play some Magic with friends. It wasn't that bad, but people around here act like they don't know how to drive if there's snow on the ground.    I don't know if there was more surprise snow last night, but I woke up this morning to more snow. It's really, really pretty. I'm probably going to post a picture if I can get one.    Anyway, the only thing better than cuddling up with my boyfriend on a snow day is cuddling up with my boyfriend on a snow day with pizza! 'Cause everyone knows you can make anything better with pizza. :P     As promised, pictures!  http://i.imgur.com/jZHtGVy.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/L1oyz7s.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/vvzCkKb.jpg  As you can see, the snow is slowly melting away.

I'm a student in the UK, and I, like most students, rely heavily on student loans to get by.  Unfortunately, my student loan hasn't come in this time around. I've been fighting tooth and nail to get it sorted, and its not come through yet, because someone at the student loans company was a Forgetful Fred and forgot to send my required paperwork through to the right people. Yep.  So, now that I'm out of food that isn't plain pasta ~~or tinned Mac n' Cheese~~, a pizza pie sounds good. SO good. Oh man.  But yeah. It'd be nice. I've been gifted to before, and said I would gift when my monetary situation was sorted, and unfortunately it hasn't yet, and that was 9 months ago... Yeah I know, right? But yeah. Expect a lot of pies to be given out when my loan hits.  And I know you guys don't like sob stories, so [here's a video game I'm working on, to lighten the mood.

t3_16yh6g	1358727034.0	faceforest	pizza	[Offer] Open to all	Long story short: I was robbed in my home and held at gun point earlier this week by multiple armed robbers and obviously was going through some tough emotion things along with balancing my classes at college. Basically I had a lot of wonderful friends and family who supported my this whole week and while I still am dealing with it all, I would like to pay it forward and help anyone that needs pizza (Other types of food are perfectly acceptable too). Unfortunately my cap on funds is extremely low (for obvious reasons), so I only can pay ~$10. (I'm sorry those with families).   Basically (I know there will be liars as there usually are in these situations) just tell me why you need or would like one. Honestly I would just like to help anyone - whether you just blazed and are starving or like me, just got robbed and lost everything (sorry /r/trees but the latter comes in priority).   I've had support during one of the worst weeks of my life and would like to help support someone else who needs it.   Edit: And not to sound like a dick, but please don't lie, I'm not going to deny you the opportunity if you just say "I'm hungry" I'm just giving precedence to those that have/currently facing hardships.  EDIT: I won't be up/down voting anyone, I'm leaving that to the community to decide-just for the reference of those participating.   **edit:** I'll be ending this in about ~30 minutes and declaring a winner. Stay tuned!  **Congratulations** to obsaxman and HTP5; While I'm low in funding and would love to help you out, I can manage to eat a little less a day to make these two redditers happy. I will PM you will details about how you would like your reward (sorry but still only $10 each)  Honestly, if I could (as I would hope others would), I'd give you all pizzas for the things that have happened to you, I hope you all feel better and things turn out better; I mean hey, I had 2 guns pointed inches from my face upon waking up and 4 days again and I'm getting back to me feet, slowly but surely. It will get better with time. Much love from me to you all!	1358734058.0
t3_16wl24	1358643546.0	dam360	pizza	[Contest] $25 to your choice of the Big 3! (Details inside)	So, here's the deal. I love cars. It's not that I know a lot about cars, but rather that I enjoy them. As such, the purpose of this contest is to post a verified picture of yourself with a car of some kind. I will pick the car I like best and that person will receive an $25 e-gift card to their choice of the Big 3! I will also give out a second place e-gift card worth $15. Here are the rules as follows.  1. Anyone participating must have use an account which is at least 1 month old. No exceptions. Also, U.S. only.  2. This is not /r/foodpantry or /r/Assistance. If you are desperately in need of food for whatever reason, feel free to go to one of those sub-reddits. Sob stories, as well as complaining, will get you absolutely nowhere with me. In fact, I will probably just ignore your post altogether.  3. Your picture must be verified. If you are worried about having your identity posted on the internet, then take a picture of a car with just your username included in the picture. I just want to make sure that you didn't find this car through Google, but rather that you went out and searched for it.  4. I will be determining the winner this coming Monday at 7:00pm Ct. If you post your picture after that, you will be disqualified.  5. In case you haven't realized it yet, the car you post a picture of does not need to be your own. If you don't own a cool car, look around for one. I have given you 2 days to go searching, so time shouldn't be an issue.  6. My interpretation of cool can mean a lot of things.  A Ferrari will not necessarily be the winner. It can be interesting or cool for a number of reasons besides its actual worth.  7. There is only one car per entry.  I believe that's everything. If you have any questions, feel free to ask away and I will do my best to answer them. I do not have 24 hour access to the internet, so you will have to be patient with me. Good luck and good hunting!  The winners are as follows  1st place goes to GhostRider22  2nd place goes to skinlessmonkey  Thank you all for making this such a fun contest. I can only be on the internet for about smith 30 minutes, so p.m. me with your choice of the Big 3 as well as your e-mail address.	1358816881.0

t3_16v22d	1358572444.0	synthetic_sound	FAP	Tell me your favorite fact, win pizza!	/edit - Well folks! My sister, [losermedia](http://www.reddit.com/user/losermedia) came over to help me pick a winner, and we couldn't decide! So, we have two winners! And those people are....  **dielectric_eating** - For their facts about parrots! Too cute!   and  **modernmist** - For their facts about the sun. The conversation eventually led to a documentary being posted about a man who makes music with the [sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcqiLvHiACQ), and it was one of the most beautiful and creative things I had seen in so long. Data Sonification....what an amazing idea.   So thanks everyone for paricipating again! I promise to keep doing these contests...it's so much fun, and I feel like all of us walked away having learned at least one fact that we didn't know before we started reading the thread!    ::::::::: Hello my favorite lovely pizza friends! Last week I had a contest asking for everyone's favorite dinosaur, and it was a hit! So my sister and I were talking this evening, and we wanted to offer another pizza, along those same lines.  So here is this week's contest: What is your favorite **fact**? It can be a historical fact, or a science fact, it could even be something about your favorite musician...the sky is the limit. Just do me a favor and link to an article (even from Wiki) that provides some proof about your fact. One of the best things about last weeks contest was reading about so many critters I had never even heard of.   So for example, my fact is one that was posted here on Reddit a few days ago. Apparently one out of every six stars has it's own Earth sized planet in orbit around it! That...is amazing. [Here's](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2013/pr201301.html) the article in case you missed it:   My [sisters'](http://www.reddit.com/user/losermedia) fact is that a cats purr vibrates at a level that actually has healing properties towards humans! [Here](http://consciouscat.net/2009/09/14/the-cats-purr-a-biomechanical-healing-mechanism/) is a brief article about it.  To make sure this contest gets some momentum, we're going to wait to pick a winner until Sunday afternoon. And please feel free to duke it out and discuss why your fact is the **best** fact! Keep it civil though, hehe.   This contest is for the USA. And if you're the winner, you will be to chose from one of the big 3! Unless of course you have a local spot that will accept GC purchases from their website.  :D  	1358714252.0

I just have been incredibly stressed lately, but today I feel happy. I feel like I am feeling the warmth of the sun although its cloudy outside.  I am just feeling happy and pizza would make me even happier!   I woke up so I am happy. I have a roof over my head so I am happy. I have health and most of all I have friends and family so I am happy.  It's easy to think about what would don't have but it's harder to choose to be positive and happy.  So... I am in Delaware, USA and while I am already happy, I could be even happier with Pizza. :-)  Stay positive all!   **Edit: Just wanted to thank you all and just remind everyone, no matter what's going on in your life to try to think positive and just breath, you will never live this moment again.**	1358479167.0

I have budgeted my savings to try and make sure i keep my head above water until i start work again, unfortunately that excludes pizza.  Which is a cryin' shame.   Oh, i should add, im from the UK.  Edit: Ha!  I just noticed the 'got pizza'd' next to my name and got really confused.  Then i remembered this from last year: [My Request](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pcb9l/offer_will_do_a_snow_angel_in_just_underwear_for/), and subsequent [recieval](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pcgrf/received_snow_angel_delivered_thanks_otterdam/).

t3_16lkyh	1358223918.0	krubly	FAP	[OFFER] Hinesville, GA.. Or where ever else matters. (which means ANYWHERE)	This is my turn to pay it forward. Right? I got pizza'd a few weeks ago, and now I want to return the favor to someone that really craves that pie like I do. So, as I've been new at Reddit for the past few months, and I love what I read, I would like to pick someone at RANDOM. But now, I want to make this worth it. My 'WIFE' recently cleaned me out.. bank, property, etc.. I'm left with just my uniforms for work, and I had just happen to find my Truck 30 miles away w/a fee. So the deal is.. Tell me something about your fucked up relationships, past or present. Be Honest. Please... because just for fun, I might buy 2 Pie's. It all depends. I'm fucking broken like everyone else, it would be nice to pay it forward TWICE.  EDIT: Thank you for all the feedback! I picked the winner at random and unfortunately I could only afford 1 Pizza right now (GAS Prices are not good for my truck). I was a little late coming back here and reading through all of your stories. Interesting reads, a few were like HOLY SHIT, WOW. If I can, I'll try to get one of my buddies to join in and pick someone else too. :)	1358371588.0

t3_16k5s6	1358183950.0	majorthrowaway	shroom	[Request] UK. Unemployed, single, broke, and hungry. I'm not particularly attractive either according to my luck on OKC. I'll settle for knocking hungry off that list first though.	Hi there.  So I'm a bit of a lurker and know I don't really deserve anything but I really hope someone just goes "Damn, I'll feed you!". I've been unemployed now for 2 months and as I was living payslip to payslip I'm now deep in the red.   It sucks.   On the upside I do live near to a Pizza Hut, a Papa Johns, and a Dominos.    So if anyone would be so kind to order me one that would be amazing! I could actually space that out into two meals (one for today and one for tomorrow) too.   I would go collect it too! No need for you to pay for delivery as I'm less than 10 minutes away and getting out of this place would do me some good. I've not left my flat in like a week.  Edit:  Just feel that I should mention that while I may sound like I'm rather depressed I'm not. Just down on my luck and hopeful that things will work out!   **Update: The fantastic /user/piratepegleg has given me the gift of joy, pizza, and then another pizza! They are officially a brilliant person in my universe! :)**	1358196682.0

t3_16igpt	1358114768.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] GAME: Prisoner's Dilemma	***This is one of my more complicated games/contests.  Please skip over this if you are not interested in putting in the effort and just want easy pizza, instead of [complaining](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/13e2fs/offer_lets_play_sentencepicture/c738152).  If you're interested in having some fun with this (and making the mental effort to understand it), please proceed and MAKE SURE TO READ EVERYTHING.***  ---  **OOPS: The deadline for part 1 is Wednesday, the *16th* around 11pm.  (The post initially said Wednesday, the 13th)**  ---  **NEW:** Just to make sure I don't miss anybody... I am sending a PM reply when I note down your entry for Part 1.  If you don't get a reply from me in 24 hours, please resend your message.  (I'll just have to be extra-careful looking through entries near the end, but this is also a good reason to get your entry in early!)  ---  **Important Background Information:**  Ok, so this is one I've been thinking of doing for a while.  This game is basically a version of the [Prisoner's Dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma).  I highly suggest reading the linked Wikipedia page, but here's the most important part (quoted from Wikipedia):  > Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. If he testifies against his partner, he will go free while the partner will get three years in prison on the main charge. Oh, yes, there is a catch ... If both prisoners testify against each other, both will be sentenced to two years in jail.  Also important is this analysis (again from Wikipedia, emphasis mine):  > In this classic version of the game, collaboration is dominated by betrayal; if the other prisoner chooses to stay silent, then betraying them gives a better reward (no sentence instead of one year), and if the other prisoner chooses to betray then betraying them also gives a better reward (two years instead of three). Because betrayal always rewards more than cooperation, all purely rational self-interested prisoners would betray the other, and so the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them both to betray each other. **The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads the prisoners to both betray, but they would get a better reward if they both cooperated. In reality, humans display a systematic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games, much more so than predicted by a theory based only on rational self-interested action.**  I have always been intrigued by the emphasized part of this (well before the [recent game show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_It_All_%28game_show%29)), and figured, let's do a pizza game about it!  ---  **Part 1:**  This part is simple.  To do a game of this sort, I need a fixed number of participants.  I will be using a random number generator to decide.  At the specified time, I am going to use random.org to generate an integer between 1 and 1000.  The 8 people with the closest guesses (over and under both are ok) will get to play the prisoner's dilemma game.  If there is a tie at the far end, it will be broken by generating another random number for that tie.  **IMPORTANT: ENTER BY PM'ING ME YOUR NUMBER.  DO NOT POST ANYTHING HERE.  ANYONE POSTING ANYTHING HERE *WILL* BE DISQUALIFIED.**  If you want to say "good contest" or "you suck" or something you can, but ONLY IF YOU'RE NOT ENTERING THE CONTEST.  This is essential, because a lack of communication between the participants is central to the prisoner's dilemma, so no exceptions will be made.  I will decide the participants around 11pm (this may move around a bit depending on my schedule) on Wednesday, the **16th**.  The participants will be notified via PM.  Note that the participants will not be listed here until after part 2 is over.  ---  **Part 2:**  This is the fun part.  Let's rename "prisoner's dilemma" to "prize-winner's dilemma" and give it this new description in the form of an imaginary letter presented to the 8 people chosen in Part 1:  > Congratulations!  You have been selected by psm321 to receive a $15 pizza prize!  In his great wisdom, he has also randomly paired you up with another Redditor receiving a $15 prize, and decided that you may steal $10 from that Redditor's prize if you wish, making your total prize $25 (and the other Redditor's prize only $5).  He has given the other Redditor this same option.  However, be forewarned... psm321 can be very temperamental.  If both members of the pair decide to steal from each other, psm321 will get mad at how selfish everyone in the world is, and take $5 away from each of your prizes, leaving you each with only $10.  Good luck!  Note that this formulation retains a key aspect of the original prisoner's dilemma.  Each individual is better off by deciding to steal, regardless of what the other person chose.  If your partner doesn't steal, you end up with more if you steal ($25 vs. $15), and if your partner does steal, you end up with more by deciding to steal ($10 vs $5).  However, if each person actually acts on that, both end up worse off than they would have had they both done the right thing and not stolen ($10 each instead of $15 each).  Nobody stealing is better for both than both stealing, but the individual is always better off stealing.  This presents a dilemma in what choice you should make.  Do you trust the other person to do the right thing?  Do they trust you to do the right thing?  Nobody knows...  If you are notified that you are playing, PM me your choice (steal or don't steal) within 12 hours, and your e-mail address (for the gift card).  The sooner people PM me, the sooner I can determine the results and get gift cards out.  If you don't respond within 12 hours, somebody else will take your place.  ---  **Rules:**  * As mentioned above, it is essential to this contest that there be no communication/planning between participants.  This means that if I see any evidence of it, such as a thread here or elsewhere trying to gather participant names, coordinate strategy, or anything like that, I will have to cancel the contest.  Don't ruin it for everyone.  * Prizes will be awarded in the form of US Pizza Hut eGift Cards.  An alternative prize may be considered at my discretion if you can show that you live in the US but have no Pizza Hut near you. Please PM me before players are chosen if you want this consideration.  * Either in an update to this post, or in a new post, I will post the results from the individual pair-ups.  To prevent any fighting, I will present names of participants in one list in randomized order, and then will separately post the results of each of the 4 match-ups without revealing who the players were in each match-up.  * I reserve the right to amend/add any rules as needed to account for situations that I overlooked or forgot about.  * Only one account per person please.  * A thanks thread and/or pictures of the pizza you get are always appreciated (but not required) :)  ---  **Special Note:**  Thanks to a generous Redditor who wishes to remain anonymous for contributing $20 towards the prize pool for this contest!  ---  **Results:**  * The random number was 658 * One person was within the closest 8 but was disqualified for a rule violation, and the next-closest person got to play. * The players were (in order from closest to 658 to farthest): FutureFlyDoc, sambo22, showurnuts, BryosaurusRex, elgreco927, hellow_mellow, DerekSparkles, CrayonManQuestion * The players were randomized into pairs (with a player 1, player 2 ordering because of the recording method I chose). * The results of the pairs were as follows:      **Pair 1**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $5      Player 2 STEALS, gets $25      **Pair 2**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $5      Player 2 STEALS, gets $25      **Pair 3**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $15      Player 2 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $15      **Pair 4**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $5      Player 2 STEALS, gets $25  * Interesting observation: even though the pairs were randomized (before I had responses), 3 of the pairs ended up with the same exact don't steal/steal arrangement (down to the "second" player in my spreadsheet being the one who stole)  * The distribution the random number guesses is also interesting (note the clustering on the low end, another cluster in the middle, and then the really barren upper end):   1-25: ****  26-50:  51-75:   76-100:   101-125: *  126-150:  151-175: *  176-200:   201-225: *  226-250: *  251-275:   276-300:   301-325: *  326-350:  351-375: **  376-400: *  401-425:   426-450: **  451-475: *  476-500: *  501-525: *  526-550:  551-575:   576-600: *  601-625:   626-650: *  651-675:   676-700: *  701-725:   726-750: *  751-775: *  776-800:   801-825:   826-850:  851-875:   876-900:   901-925: *  926-950:  951-975:   976-1000:   * 2 out of the 8 people live out of Pizza Hut range.  Both requested Domino's.  They were 2 out of the 3 people who chose to steal.  My Very Scientific Conclusion: lack of Pizza Hut makes you want Domino's and also makes you mean. :-P  I have an additional interesting observation but I can't post it here because it might reveal who they are.  Thanks to everyone for playing!  Let me know if there are any questions... 	1358484338.0

t3_16cz7f	1357877450.0	and_so_it_is	PIF	[OFFER] [META] [PIF] Pizza'ing It Forward. Details Within.	Hey RAoP'ers!  Tonight, I requested a random act of pie for the first time ever, hoping to receive some pizza with intentions of pizza'ing it forward tomorrow night to another RAoP'er who similarly would like to join in on the random act kindness that is RAoP.  My request was fulfilled by the generous pedji within minutes (see link to thread below).   As some have noted, this sub could use a breath or two of freshly random air, and we all know that more RAoP activity in this manner would not only generate more acts of goodwill, more pizza having in general, but also more interest in helping those who simply can't afford to [PIF], since this community would naturally generate more buzz.  With these things in mind, I propose to hatch a new RAoP plan of action:  Let's Pizza it Forward.  This designation [PIF] will be reserved for offers and requests who are available to those who desire to receive a pizza and promise to Pizza It Forward within the *NEXT SEVEN DAYS that follow their reception of their own PIF'ed gift.  Something to be especially noted is that this would be a wholly and entirely random trend, not done out of pity, but out of a desire to fulfill a random act of kindness in its own right.  So save your best stories of desperation, and reach out to assistance-oriented subs (as noted on the sidebar) if needed, but here, polite requests to fulfill your pizza needs and intentions to [PIF] should be sufficient!  For the sake allowing all to observe this awesome trend develop, could you please link, when you finally offer to [PIF], to the [OFFER] thread who [PIF]'ed you the evening before?  Without further ado, any replies to this thread should be of a discussion-driven nature.  This thread, however, is an offer, as I do plan to [PIF] tomorrow evening.  For those of you interested, please post a request with the [PIF] and [REQUEST] designations to the sub.  I look forward to reading your posts tomorrow!  And for those interested, here lies the genesis of [PIF], initially brought to you by generous RAoP patron pedji: http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/16cswq/request_random_girl_in_chicago_would_love_a/  *[EDIT]: I had originally said that a participant in [PIF] should plan to send the pizza on to the next random chap within 24 hours.  Let's change that to seven days.  This way, this plan also accommodates those who truly are waiting for a paycheck in the oncoming days and would to give back to the community in a way that extends past their initial gift. Thanks, gerbillionaire, for the tip.  [EDIT 2]: ~3 CST: haven't seen any [PIF] request posts, so have posted my offer again here.  You have until 5:30 CST to post a [PIF] request! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/16eemm/offer_pizzaing_it_forward_pif/ 	1357938540.0
t3_16bki5	1357836686.0	Imponaut	shroom	[Request] Help out a hungry family?	Fulfilled! Thank you Paisley8827! From the bottom of our hearts (and bellies)!  The money: We've got a negative bank account, my wife is due two payments from her company (she's a freelancer for a subsidiary of Penguin Books), and both of our parents have already helped us financially. We've got a 2nd account with about 30 bucks in it to last us until Tuesday.   If it were just she and I, we could scrounge. We've both been hungry before. But it isn't just us, we've got an eternally hungry 7year old, and a 1 year old who might be the worlds largest importer of milk.  I know it reads like a sob story, but it isn't. Normally things are good, and they'll be good again soon, but right now the stress of how to feed everyone is very, very taxing. Hell, starting Monday I'll be making my twice-a-week trips to the local Talecris Plasma center for the extra cash.  So, all that being said, would someone be willing to help us out tonight?  edit: We're in Pensacola, Fl for what it's worth.	1357841248.0

t3_14svpp	1355429502.0	mcredson	beaker	[META] Welcome	Due to a best of submission, we have a lot of new people in here. Great to see the community so active. To get the best experience and make it easier for everyone, there are a list of rules to the right. That will explain what tags ([Request], [Offer], [Contest], etc) to use and the do's and don'ts. If you have a question feel free to ask in this thread, many helpful users in here.      Rules:  * Keep posts Safe for Work. Be civilized.   * We encourage you to use our Verification System for offers or requests.   * **Do not delete your posts from this subreddit.** Being less than honest is a ban-able offense.   * If requesting, do not request more than once every few days.   * If giving, post everything (except private information) publicly. Private messages are exactly that, private.   * If you have information on a potential scammer, report it to the moderators. No random witch hunts.   * **Have an account age over one month old.**       Anyone is welcome to request for whatever reason. To satisfy a craving, to have a break for ramen, or simply just because. I personally don't like sob stories, but to each their own.       We keep everything transparent here. If your pizza request gets fulfilled or you give a pizza, message the mods and we will update you to some cool flair. Again, please keep images and what not SFW!      **EDIT:** Please don't request pizza in the chat. The chat is there for fun.      **FOR GIVERS:** Please post the country the offer is good for as it is hard to give e-gift cards internationally.	1355437192.0

t3_14riq9	1355367748.0	pookie85	FAP	[Request] Gray, KY RAoC Elf Mod Pookie here with hungry niece and nephew hoping for dinner box from Pizza Hut, please?	Hey, everybody!  Things are going wonderful over at /r/RandomActsOfChristmas and have been going smoothly, but tonight I received some disheartening news that my big brother was admitted to the hospital with double pneumonia and is now in CCU because they suspect he has either had a heart attack or there is viral infection around his heart.  They said he is only using 17% of his heart at the moment.  I came over to be with my sister-in-law as well as my niece (7) and nephew (9).  I was hoping maybe we could get a $10 dinner box or a $20 one so we can have some noms in the morning, too.    I can pay this forward not out of this paycheck but the next one as all my Christmas gifts are coming from this Friday's payday.  If this isn't possible, it is okay. We'll survive.  It would sure cheer up some young'ns and it'd make our tummies happy.  Either way, have a great night, RAoP. You know I love you! xx  **Thank you TheRealChrisCringle.

t3_14l524	1355113773.0	evilrick	FAP	[OFFER] Free Papa John's pizza promo code (valid til 12/16)	Tell me why you want it!  I'm in the mood to laugh, so the funnier the better.  I love original stories, and if they involve something humiliating happening to you/friend/family member, that's even better.  I've embarrassed myself enough times, now it's time to laugh at someone else's misfortune.  It isn't much, but I'd rather give it to someone than see it go to waste, I'm not big on PJ's.  Edit: I'll choose someone tomorrow morning/afternoon, give people time to respond!  Edit2: I decided I'd share my own story, just to be fair.  I was in 9th grade, it was the first half of the school year, so I was still sort of getting used to the whole high school process.  I woke up, telling my parents I wasn't feeling well.  Mom believed me, but dad didn't care and made me go to school anyway.  BIG MISTAKE, DAD  First class of the day, English.  My stomach is churning, my head is pounding, and I can't get the teacher's attention.  The lousy thing is, I'm in the back of the class, as far away from the door as I can be.  My stomach gives one final lurch, and vomit fills my throat.  I can't talk.  I frantically try to get the teacher's attention as the vomit attempts to escape the confines of my body, but he doesn't respond.  I jump up and bolt for the door, holding my hands over my mouth in an attempt to stem the flood.  It doesn't work too well, and a couple of the snottier girls in the class get a little bile on their homework in exchange for their barely stifled snickers.   Bitches.  I make it to the trash can outside the class and a moment later it needs a Hazmat team to clean it.  I bolt to the bathrooms and throw up three more times before I'm able to stumble down to the nurse's office.  Dad had to come pick me up.  My first words as I got in his truck?  Told you I was sick.  I'll announce the winner at ~1-2pm EST, somewhere in there.  Edit: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!  ohshithax has been chosen!	1355163109.0

STILL waiting for my unemployment check and my daughter has officially called a strike on ramen and (surprisingly) Mac and Cheese.  I have already had to get TP in unconventional ways today.

Since it's the holiday season, give me your best holiday story--funny, sad, whatever.    I'll choose a random person and send them the code.  Please:  No accounts less than 3 months old  No accounts that have received but not paid it forward  No sob stories about how your great uncle Sam died and you need food for his wake (etc.)  This will close at 1:30pm Pacific.  **IMPORTANT EDIT:** u/way2funni has pointed out that this offer may be tied to my account, in which case I will have to order the pie for you (which means you may have to give me your address).  If that is the case, I'll just need the winner to give me the address and time/day they would like their pizza delivered and I'll set it up.   If you're not comfortable with that, I understand; however, the mods should be able to verify that I have ordered many pies in the past (some to home addresses) without any serial killer action as a result.    **The winner has been notified; thanks to all who participated!**	1354829853.0

I got 2 different emails from Pizza Hut today for my birthday for free Cinnasticks and Breadsticks. Sadly, I'm unable to use it because I don't have the money to order anything and it's not like I'm fond of Pizza Hut's sticks anyways. My request is if I can maybe have a pizza since I'm starving and I'm in a complicated situation with no money at all and no food in this house. I plan on becoming an active pizza giver and give back as soon as I get an income of some sort since I have been shown kindness before. It's **not required** that I receive one to get breadsticks coupons so I'll give them out by **10pm EST** regardless. Just post anything. Thank you and good luck!  Edit 1: Ok since no one has posted anything yet then I might have to extend this to tomorrow if it's not so successful tonight. I want to give some people a chance to get these coupons. :/	1354413770.0
t3_1448sb	1354394562.0	isothien	pizza-gold	[OFFER] I need Mario screenshots!	So here's the deal. I am working on a project and it requires as high of a resolution (I need to see how many pixels everything has) of the 8 world maps (the full world, including that one world that has the little islands you have to boat to) of Super Mario Bros 3, the version from All Stars that has better color than the original. Now I would do it myself but I broke my computer yesterday and am now waiting for parts to be delivered. I had the All Stars game for an emulator and was set to take screenshots when my laptop decided to slip off my lap desk onto the floor and crack the screen.  So, you, if you can get me screenshots of this game's full world maps then I will gift you with a pizza or two. I will also love you forever.  Remember, it is important that it isnt blurry and it is big enough that I can count the pixels.	1354408039.0

t3_140nb1	1354227514.0	rdowntime	PIF	[Request] Could really use some comfort food.	I hate the idea of making a request on here. Contests don't bother me because well it's a contest but outright asking for help isn't something that I like to do. That being said, I could really use one right about now. I don't have any money until tomorrow evening when I get paid and we have been living off noodles and ham sandwiches all week. My son had another febrile seizure a couple of hours ago which makes his second this month, the first was Nov 12th (I can provide the ER records from that one because I panicked a little and called 911). He is 5. I am still a little shaky because regardless of the fact that they are "harmless" it is really not something a parent enjoys seeing their child go through. I have a doctors appointment set up for tomorrow morning to see if he is sick with anything I should worry about and also because I want to get a referral for him see a neurologist, he was only 2 the last time he was seen by one. I have kind of rambled here but I guess I am also using this post as a way to vent. Long story short is I am in just the right mood to ask reddit for a pizza for tonight. I will pay it forward. I can most likely do it this weekend. I can't promise this but I will if I have enough after getting some actual food for this house and paying bills. It wont be much though, a $15 card for somewhere.  Edit:  I am in Tallahassee, FL. Sorry for not adding that to the title.  Edit 2:  I understand that some folks may think I am being selfish by using my son's seizure as an excuse to ask for a free pizza. Heck I feel selfish even asking. I mention him in any request for assistance because he is my life and and he IS the reason that I even bother. If it were me on my own I would eat my noodles and get over it but it is my son and I and I would very much like to feed him a food that he likes and hasn't had all week. He is still napping. He could very well stay asleep for the night. But I would love to have some pizza to give him when he wakes up and so my request stands. Also I would like to amend what I said about paying it forward. I will in fact pizza forward this weekend if someone helps out and that is a promise.     Edit 3 and final: He woke up so I made Ramen. So I will retract my request since we have eaten tonight and tomorrow night I will be able to afford food. If you would still like to pizza us so we have something delicious to eat in the morning/for lunch tomorrow I will be happy to stick to my pizza forward promise but I felt obligated to say that he has eaten tonight now.	1354240471.0

t3_13folk	1353300287.0	psm321	psm321	[Contest] sentence-picture results/voting thread, plus a twist (= more pizza prizes available)!	**Intro**  This is a followup to my offer [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/13e2fs/offer_lets_play_sentencepicture/).  Unfortunately, AlchemicalMusical had to pull out due to an emergency, leaving only 2 players.  At first I was going to cancel, but then I thought of a way to improvise and make it work by participating myself.  AlchemicalMusical gets a $5 gift card for providing one of the starting sentences.  ---  **The Games**  There were only two games.  *First set:*  * Sentence by me: The merry-go-round spun faster and faster until everyone on it threw up and then started having hallucinations.  * Picture by Sabromex: [http://i.imgur.com/9MREb.png](http://i.imgur.com/9MREb.png) (took significantly longer than the allotted 15 minutes)  * Sentence by blargiznoflo: The hairy Ferris wheel caused many parkgoers to puke.  *Second set:*  * Sentence by AlchemicalMusical: The spinning record on the turntable was shattered by falling bowling balls.  * Picture by blargiznoflo: [http://i.imgur.com/FZQlm.png](http://i.imgur.com/FZQlm.png)  * Sentence by Sabromex: The black record fell swiftly onto the jukebox playing a song called What's new Pussy Cat.  ---  **The Voting**  Below, you will see two comments by me: one for Sabromex and one for blargiznoflo.  Give one of them (or I suppose both, though that seems pointless) an upvote for their contributions.  The person with the most upvotes by 11pm EST on Tuesday, Nov. 20th will get an extra $10 card.  **Downvotes do not count.  Please don't use multiple accounts to vote.**  ---  **The Twist -- Read carefully!!**  There were delays and other time idiosyncrasies on the part of both players.  This prevented a second game from being completed.  However, Sabromex was able to draw a picture for another sentence that I provided.  You can find this picture here: [http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png](http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png)  I will post a third comment that says "Make a sentence for this picture: [http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png](http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png)".  Out of the replies **to this comment**, around 11pm EST on Tuesday, Nov. 20th, a $10 prize (US Pizza Hut eGift Card) will go to the most upvoted reply (again, downvotes don't count), and another $10 prize will go to the reply that comes closest (in my judgement) to the original sentence I provided Sabromex.  Sabromex and blargiznoflo are ineligible for this portion.  One entry per person please, and again please don't use multiple accounts to circumvent this or upvote multiple times (but feel free to upvote multiple entries).  ---  **Update/Results**  * Sabromex wins the extra $10 with 9 upvotes to blargiznoflo's 7.  * ohitsthatguy86 wins a $10 card for the most upvoted sentence "Reddit is sad over the amount of trolls looking for pizza" with 5 upvotes  * The sentence I gave Sabromex, from which he drew the picture, was "The kind Redditor was insulted by a troll for having too many rules in his pizza offer.".  In my judgement, Dendo1 came closest with "A sad Redditor was offended by a troll because he had a list of rules for his pizza giveaway", so he wins a $10 card.  * Why so many downvotes on things when I said they wouldn't count?  Just wondering...	1353471130.0

t3_13e2fs	1353222627.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] Let's play sentence-picture!	**Please read this *entire* post CAREFULLY before participating (I took the time to write so much for a reason).**  This **requires** all participants to be on the same page to work, so I will ***not*** be able to be tolerant of those not following the rules.  I am doing this after being encouraged [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/12ndkv/meta_complicated_contests/).  Hopefully I will not be disappointed and can do other things of similar (or more) complexity in the future.  ---  **General Information**  So here's my idea: playing sentence-picture (a.k.a. the sentence game a.k.a. telephone pictionary).  The basic idea is that you have a number of players, and alternate between writing a sentence that describes what's going on in the last person's picture, and drawing a picture of the last person's sentence.  It is then amusing to look at the whole chain and how it distorts over iterations.  If that was not clear enough, you can get a basic idea of the game at http://www.thesentencegame.com/rules.php (though not that we will **not** be using that platform, and the rules will **not** be exactly the same, just a general idea).  Read this page anyway, even if you think you already know how the game works.  ---  **Basic structure**  1. We will be playing with 5 people, and 2 alternates. 2. The participants will be selected from the comments (that follow the rules) in this post, using upvotes as a guideline.  The participants will be announced at 4PM EST this evening (Sunday, November 18th). 3. The game will happen at 10pm EST tonight (Sunday, November 18th).  Please make sure you will be available and actively checking Reddit messages at this time if selected as a player or alternate. 4. There will be a second stage in which all five sentence-picture chains will be posted and people will be asked to vote on their favorite contributor amongst the chains.  (This will be done with comments made by me for each username, because it's the best way I can think of, plus free karma!  Mods, please tell me if this breaks some Reddit rule)  ---  **Prizes**  * The 5 main participants will each get a $10 US Pizza Hut eGift Card (assuming they complete the game satisfactorily).  * The 2 alternates will each get a $5 US Pizza Hut eGift Card.  (Bumped up to $10 if they are called on to participate).  * The winning participant from the second stage will get an additional $10 US Pizza Hut eGift Card (or a single $20 card if they had agreed to wait until voting was over to receive the prize).  * An alternative prize may be considered at my discretion if you can show that you live in the US but have no Pizza Hut near you.  Please contact me *before* the contest starts if you want this consideration.  ---  **Game Procedure/Rules**  * Keep everything (sentences and pictures) PG-rated.  Submissions not following this rule will disqualify the submitter.  * Post a comment here with your starting sentence (**and nothing else**).  Everyone should upvote their favorite starting sentences to help me decide who plays.  Only one comment per person.  * If selected, plan to be available from 10PM to 11PM-ish (EST).  This may run a bit longer if I have to bring in alternates.  * At approximately 10PM, I will send everyone a sentence.  Draw a picture of that sentence and send it to me (post on imgur and send me a link) within 15 minutes (make sure that you have the ability to do this, and save time for uploading/messaging).  If I don't get it in time, you are disqualified and I will bring an alternate in.  Pictures may be hand-drawn and photographed, or drawn in a computer program.  Use the "**What are the rules for drawing?**" section on the [thesentencegame](http://www.thesentencegame.com/rules.php) page as approximate guidelines (but keep in mind the PG rule).  * When I have all 5 pictures, I will send them to the next person in the circle.  Write a sentence about what is happening in the picture and send it to me within 5 minutes.  Use the "**What are the rules for sentences?**" section on the [thesentencegame](http://www.thesentencegame.com/rules.php) page as approximate guidelines (but keep in mind the PG rule).  * The above 2 steps will repeat once (so that we end on a sentence, which a complete chain of sentence-picture-sentence-picture-sentence).  * Once the game is complete, alternates who were not called upon to participate will get their prize, and participants will have a choice of receiving their prize or waiting until the second stage is complete.  * At some point (hopefully soon) afterwards, I will post another thread for second stage voting.  ---  **General Rules**  * Please do not use extra accounts to upvote yourself, either in this stage or in the judging stage.  Along the same lines, don't use multiple accounts to put multiple entries in.  * I reserve the right to amend/add any rules as needed to account for situations that I overlooked or forgot about.  * Not a rule per se, but I really appreciate thanks threads, and/or a photo of the pizza!  ---  *Special thanks to [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) (my first time using it) for making composing this post much easier thanks to the Live Preview feature (and to a lesser extent the other editing features).*  ---  **Updates**  1. It looks like we have only 3 participants (Sabromex, AlchemicalMusical, blarglznoflo).  It won't be as fun, but I'm going to try to make this work!  (with some minor changes...)  2. One of the participants had to withdraw unfortunately.  I'm not sure I'll still be able to pull this off.  I'm re-opening this 'till right before we start, so go ahead and post if you're interested.  3. Sorry, not happening (won't work with just 2 people).  Maybe I'll try again later with more notice.  If there are times that work better for people, let me know.  4. Actually, I just thought of a way to do something.  PMs coming soon.  5.

THANKS FOR THE FUN.  :D**     So between coin roll hunting and never spending any of my change I amassed this http://imgur.com/TyDUb.jpg mound of change. Last night I rolled most of it up and counted it all. **What do you think the total amount is?** There are nickels, dimes, quarters, halves and dollar coins included. I'll let this run all day and pick the person that guesses the right amount, or the closest without going over (yes, like the Price is Right but a $1 bid here will suck) when I'm done working and doing my errands.

Good luck, winner gets a $20 gift card to your choice of the big three.  **Totally random, but I do require that accounts are at least 30 days old and active on subs other than looking for free shit.**  **The total was $1141.15!

Not sure if that list changes, or what. And a reminder: you all get THREE guesses!  Still hasn't been guessed! I guess "not obscure" was a bit too broad. The list's been narrowed down by quite a lot, though!)  **Hooray! jphoenix has guessed it! The correct answer was Battlestar Galactica! Thanks for playing, everyone!**	1352963227.0

t3_13719h	1352920461.0	mcredson	beaker	[META] Account Age Limits	Going to keep this short and to the point.      We are going to be enforcing an age limit of one month starting now. This will only be for those posting a request. Young accounts will still be able to participate in other aspects of the community (contest as per the givers rules, offers, posting coupons, etc). This will be a manual process at first then we will eventually put in a bot to do this for us. Please report any requests from accounts that do no meet this requirement for now. We also are removing requests at our discretion if we feel users are solely using reddit for RAOP. That means an account that may be exactly one month old, but has no history, may be removed as well.      There are a variety of reasons for this that we can discuss in the comments. We aren't trying to focus on being a charity, and unfortunately sites like WUAH and TOW like to use us as one. Keep in mind this isn't the only reason.      As always please remember to not use multiple accounts, don't delete posts, and follow all rules in the sidebar to the right.      I'm hoping the other mods will join in on this discussion, hence the reason this is a little light.      Edit: Looks like this is going over fairly positive with a few objections.	1352938510.0

I haven't been over here for a while because I haven't been in the position to help financially, but I also haven't been asking either. As someone who has given and received, I am seeing a TON of promises to pay it forward but I am not seeing that many actually doing it. Has all the publicity ruined ROAP?? Now I am even more bummed! This was always the place I could come to be cheered up by giving a pizza or reading how happy people who have received a pizza are, and once in a while even by getting a pizza.

For those who don't remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/11z669/meta_papa_johns_coupon/) was posted a bit ago.  Once it was deleted it was near impossible to find again, and no traces of the internet have it that I could see except for RAOP.  Today is Monday, the day after all the NFL games, and the code will not work.  Did this code *ever* work?  Does anyone know where to find a major coupon of more than 25% off for today?  I'm going to keep researching and post my results, any help would be appreciated!   Edit: As a test, I have put in addresses for locations in Texas, Wisconsin, Florida, Utah, Colorado, and now Virginia.  Nothing works...grr.

t3_12vi0p	1352406594.0	NikkoE82	pizza	[CONTEST] Help 60 college students get a pizza party and I'll give out FOUR gift cards! Pick a number between 1-4,000.	Here's the story. Today, my professor offered my class a chance for a pizza party.  If we can get at least 1,000 likes for his non-profit's Facebook page, he'll buy us all pizza.  If we can get 2,000, he'll throw in cupcakes.  If we can get 3,000, he'll throw in cold soda.  This is the Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Big-Sell/130452977004303  It's a cool event he holds once a year where entrepreneurs have an opportunity to pitch their idea and win a chance to see that idea realized.  At the time he offered this, the number of likes was roughly 415.  Here's what I'm going to do for you guys:  Automatically, I'm going to give away a $10 gift card to whoever comes closest to the number I've assigned to that amount by 7PM EST tonight.  Then, I'll give away a $25 gift card for every 1,000 increase in likes from 415 up to 3,415.  So, at 1,415 I'll give away the first $25 gift card to who ever is closest to the number I've assigned to that gift card.  The best part for you is we have a couple of weeks to get those 1,000-3,000 likes. So that part of the contest will stay open as long as it can.  One number per person, please. I wanted to come up with a way to give those who actually "Like" the page a chance to pick two numbers, but I couldn't come up with a decent way of determining that. If you have a suggestion, I'll take it.  EDIT: The $10 gift card has been won by *drumroll* rebelfeather12 with a guess of 2424. The number was 2415. Congrats, rebelfeather12! Remember, everyone else, that the remaining gift cards are still in play!  EDIT II: Sorry, everyone. This contest is over. We gave it our best but it just didn't cut it. It was fun, though! And my teacher seemed to really appreciate my effort.	1354896505.0

This doesn't appear to be outside of the guidelines, but I'll leave it to the moderators if it is.  A friend of mine is in need of a scholarship to go to a conference.  I want her to win it, so I'm going all out for a scholarship.  Here's where you come in: post an imgur picture of you sharing a "please vote" on Facebook (this is super easy, doesn't require an app, and is a ONE TIME ONLY voting thing, for the record) and I'll randomly draw a winner.  PLEASE edit out any and all personal details from your post (I know you kids can use MS Paint).  This is not the time for identity theft or people being meanies, and that can happen if your name is visible.  Details:  If you look at my posting history, you'll see that I'm a generous Redditor. Now, I'd like you to be equally generous to Mel Orpen, a fabulous lady who's trying to be sponsored for a scholarship to a conference by the Victory Institute.

Details here: http://onwardtovictory.victoryinstitute.org/candidate.php?cid=51  You can read her story and (I think) be moved by why she needs to get to this conference and continue being a fabulous ally.  Or, you can just take it from me that she's the most fabulous person the planet.  PM me for details.

No Redditors who only post in "gimme" threads asking for assistance without paying it forward.  Must be willing to provide verification if asked and have a valid email address for the e-card.

If you have received multiple pies but haven't paid it forward I will not give you a pizza.  Alright, now that that's out of the way, let's hear about the drunken groomsmen or the puking bride...  EDIT:  Please, guys, no more downvoting for no reason.  There are perfectly good stories here with negative karma...  DOUBLE EDIT: The gift card winner has been messaged.

Gotta love Random Acts of Pizza!  As a result of some unexpected circumstances, I had to move last weekend. I'm done being sore, but things aren't going as planned... My ethernet connection is limited to a few feet (barely into my bedroom or the hallway), we only have two keys for three people, and the fridge is broken (new one is coming on Monday). We're making out okay, but some pizza would be pretty nice. Moving expenses have us all strapped so we're a bit limited.   Thanks for reading this!

t3_11reuh	1350672786.0	F0xism	shroom	[Request]Greensboro, NC. I don't want to put a sobby title but, my 2 year old really wants pizza.	We've been pretty broke since last month and this month. Only had enough money to pay bills and rent, so no money substantial enough to go out grocery shopping. Usually I'd just make a few pizzas for the 3 of us (me, boyfriend and son), but I don't even have flour let alone cheese or sauce.  We've even run out of pasta options. Basically what I'm saying is, my son really wants pizza and we've run out of our monthly buffering of food.  EDIT: At this point, anything would be helpful and I would be so grateful to anyone that could help me out even a little. I really don't want my son to go to bed with an empty tummy. I'm totally willing to verify the little runt's existence too.	1350679438.0

Not to pile on the bad news, because it really isn't that bad, but I just got a call from the landlord that the power's been out for a few hours in my complex, and to be careful of the food in the fridge when I get back from work. Sounds like it could be a long day. I understand that my posting history isn't too broad, but is  I'm a long time lurker and this account is two months old. Maybe someone can help me out.

t3_11p330	1350578602.0	HeeroJay	PIF	[Offer] Can a pizza fix that? [Papa John's/US only] 	Yep, HJ's back with another pizza offer. Papa John's sent me a promo code for their 2 million pizza giveaway, and I want to give it to one of you.  Today, on the second part of my commute to work (I drive to the subway, and it takes me downtown), somehow, I lost my car keys. I still can't figure out how that happened... but it made my morning really shitty (I had to take the subway back to my car, look for my keys, explore the different subway cars; still can't find them, but my aunt is bringing me my spare set when I get out).  So ROAP, answer me this: What's something shitty that happened to you today, that a pizza can fix (or at least can help make you feel better). Examples: Lost my keys, car got a flat tire, motherboard in pc melted, etc; I'm not looking for sob stories, just "Hey, that sucks, but a pizza from a random stranger could make me feel better!"  I'll choose a winner by tomorrow afternoon (Friday), so you can get Papa John's Friday night.  EDIT 1: I'm big on proof, so if something broke and you can take a picture, I can better sympathize.   EDIT 2: The train authority can't find my keys, and since I have a chip in mine (even though it's a 94?!?) a new one will cost $30 to make. That really sucks.  EDIT 3: I ended up choosing two winners, Hbaz09, and jalapeno. I PM'd you, so get back to me.	1350658732.0

t3_1130v7	1349608366.0	crashed9	pizza	[Offer] Draw a dinosaur, maybe get a pizza. Contest!	**Got kaeby his/her pizza. :) Enjoy! This was fun, so as soon as I'm able to, I'll do another contest!**  **WINNER: kaeby! Please PM me within an hour so that I can get you your pizza/whatever else! My son had an awesome time looking at all the pictures. I'm pretty certain he liked yours best because it looks just like his favorite dinosaur toy! A close second and third were 4our5quare and blarglznoflo. So if I don't hear from kaeby, I'll just go down to 2nd then 3rd place. :) Thanks so much! I hope I can do this again soon!**  **Closed! Give me ten minutes to get the final decision. :) I'll PM the winner asap!**  My 4 year old is ridiculously obsessed with dinosaurs. To the point where we don't order pepperoni pizza, we order dinosaur meat pizza. He'll be with his dad all day today because I need to study for my big Praxis exam tomorrow (like the bar exam for teachers.. only not so horrendous). I also got two new students to tutor, so I'm finally in a position to do this contest that I've been wanting to do since I first saw RAOP!  So here's the deal. Tonight at 6pm EST, my son will come home. I want to be able to show him a bunch of awesome dinosaur pictures drawn by you guys! I'll let him choose his favorite, and that person will get a pizza!   Rules?:   1. Any picture drawn by you is fine. Doesn't matter if you use Paint or draw something on paper then scan it. As long as it's drawn. 2. Remember: he's 4 years old. I can't tell you what picture he would like better. This isn't really a contest of skill.  3. You can't be a new Redditor. I'll certainly show my kid your picture, but if you've been a member for 0 days, you won't win. Sorry! I think I'll put a one-month-membership requirement.  4. I'm going to use the RAOP email verification thing. 5. $15 to whatever pizza place you want should work. I'll include a $3 tip on top of that. I just need to be able to place an order online!  6. US only. Sorry. :( 7. I would love it if you would post a thank you after you've filled your belly. :) 8. Please sign the picture with your username!  Hints:   1. My son really loves all dinosaurs. T-Rex, triceratops, velociraptor, stegosaurus, diplodocus, pteranodon, etc.  2. A fun scene will probably get his attention more. He likes funny stuff too.  3. He knows that dinosaurs eat other dinosaurs, and that they die in order to be turned into fossils. He thinks it's cool. He loves his dinosaur documentaries!   I'm very excited about this! I hope you guys enjoy the contest as much as we will. :) Also just keep in mind that my son can't read yet, so including sob stories isn't going to get you anywhere. ;)   I'll post the winner after he gets home and chooses. (Around 6pm Eastern!)  **Update: You guys are pretty rad! I love them all. :) He's home now, but he got started finishing a jigsaw puzzle he started this morning (it's a 100 piece panda jigsaw lol) and he doesn't want me bothering him. I'll have him look at all the pictures and make the final decision in a half hour, at 6:30!**	1349653289.0

Alright a few weeks ago ill admit i DID get a little carried away with pizza-ing...but THIS time things are different, i promise! Instead of giving away over $500 worth of pizza giftcards, i will be giving away THREE gift cards.  Just not from Dominoes because they hate me apparently. WHO ARE THINKS THEY SHOULD HAVE PIZZA?  Edit: Ouch, why's everybody downvoting each other? Im gonna change up the game a little bit. A test of altruism if you will. Post your blahblah why I want pizza, but here's the catch. Tell me the name of SOMEBODY ELSE who you think should get pizza. If I try to figure out who should get some myself then ill end up spending my entire paycheck on everyone because im an idiot and not drunk (a problem i will fix tomorrow). Recap: VOTE FOR THE PERSON WHO YOU THINK SHOULD GET PIZZA.  END: Alrighty, the AC is making it super cold and im too lazy to put a shirt on so im callin it a night (its 10pm here in Bahrain). Like any good democracy, there's either a 5-way tie or im horrible at counting. Considering im Asian, i dont think it's the counting thing. In the event of a tie, I WILL JUDGE YOU.  1st: wonderland_lily - Good use of Futurama!  2nd: beckermound - Even if you're using multiple accounts, I commend your spirit. YOU WANTED IT THAT HARD.   3rd: Lunar3 - I have a soft spot for moms. I have a mom. She was pregnant a few times I assume. That job sucks. I don't know if i could be a mom. Well i mean, i KNOW i cant because im a dude.  And I lied. I can do that because im an American.   4th place for being the first person to vote: ohitsthatguy86 - Yup, you get one too. BECAUSE I CAN DO THAT  Tune in next pay period for another chance to run in the PIZZA ELECTIONS. Yeah im probably gonna do this a few more times because it's fun. Only stipulation, you can only serve 1 term if you know what i mean. Just to be fair for everyone. AMERICA!	1349291862.0

Please either POST down below or PM me the link to your work. Youtube is preferred. You may put the video under "unlisted" if you are too shy for the public to stumble upon it.  3. Just for the sake of fairness, I would like this video to be brand new! I know some of you may already have prior recordings or videos. Go ahead and have a time stamped card with your Reddit username on it as well.  4. It can be a collaboration with you and your friends, but please keep in mind I only have one gift card to award. Groups will have to share a single prize.  5. THIS IS ONLY FOR FUN! Do not think that you have to have a professionally done video in order to qualify. I only ask that the audio be clear enough for me to enjoy and the time stamped card be clearly visible.  6. This contest goes until Monday October 1st, 9 PM EST. Entries submitted after will not qualify for the contest, although I will still enjoy them even though it's late. Winner will be announced by October 2nd, 9PM EST.  7. Please be from the US. I'm sorry for those outside of the country, but I'm not sure if I am able to send you an e-card. I'd hate it for you to not receive your prize if you win. If you still wish to submit a video just for the sake of it, I will most certainly enjoy it :)  8. Winners will be required to do the usual verification system just because, it appears to be the right thing to do. Standard stuff :P  Good luck and have at it guys! Please let me know if you have any questions! I will add or modify rules as I see fit. Contest might be cancelled if there is a lack of interest in it.    CONTEST IS NOW CLOSED!!! Ok guys thank you very much for participating! The contest is now closed! I will be taking the next 24 hours to enjoy the entries and going through a difficult decision of finding a winner! For everyone else, please enjoy these submissions, as I feel they were all pretty awesome :).   Winner Announcement:  Sorry for the delay everyone! I lost track of time, but my decision is to award Jpree with the pizza! It wasn't easy making a decision, so for those who did not win or were too shy to make a submission, I highly encourage you to try next time around :). Thanks everyone again for participating!

Maybe a rubber room...  Still hanging out around the reddits and will be throwing out some pies here and there.  I've enjoyed doing this this thang for the past year and happy I was able to to it.    As I said previously, I'm simply diverting some extra $$ to /r/RandomActsOfChristmas to help out parents without the financial means to provide their kids a decent Christmas day.  /u/pookie85 helped start the sub just last season...and was a complete success.  The Christmas day pics users sent in...the looks on those kids faces made it all worth while.    So if you're able to be a "Santa" or need one, or just curious... check it out :)  Should be going within the next few weeks.    Cheers!!       	1348874440.0

t3_10ebw3	1348503206.0	ross5781	shroom	[Request] Hays, KS: Do a bro a solid, it's rural out here	So I am a college kid who's carrying on a long distance relationship with a girl back from where I live in Colorado. She is coming out to visit me this weekend (gets here Friday night) and I'd love to have a nice pizza waiting for her after the 5 1/2 hour drive she has to make. Unfortunately, in order for her to visit she has to stay in a hotel and we're splitting the cost (considering she paid for gas), meaning I do not have the extra money to buy a pizza. Hook a brother up?  EDIT: As a reward, I will send the generous donor a mash-up of Gangnam Style, Party Rock Anthem, Like a G6, Pretty Fly (For a White Guy), and Bad Touch that is no longer available for public download, but very well mixed and great to listen to.	1348508699.0

t3_10a7eg	1348284439.0	Quaquaversal	pizza-gold	[Contest] Geeky Mash-Up Sketchery-Artiness (US Only) Open to Any IRL Age, Any Skill Level	**Contest is now closed!**  **Champion winner** - I contacted both the first and third placers twice but never heard back, the 2nd and the 1st 4th prize winners have already claimed their awards, so that makes **youdneverbelieveit** the Champion prize winner! Woohoo and congratulations, sir!   **You're Number Two!** winner is **hBoBh**, with the clever combos of Back to the Future screen shots (Marvin!) with MLP and Star Wars.  **Charmer Prize** goes to wolfulez, who garnered the most votes with two clever takes on fairly famous pop cultural icons - seriously, Jareth as a DJ? XD.  **Random Surprise Prize Pizza** ($7.99 for Dominos Artisan, or for $7.99 towards any other chain) goes to **Cyae1**, whose Minecraft creations I thoroughly enjoyed being taken on a little narrative tour through (especially the casual reference to the Tardis :P), but mostly because you got me on to *The IT Crowd* which is freaking hilarious.  **. . .**  **Guess what? I'M NOT DONE YET!!! No indeed, I have not finished. I have instead gone utterly mad! Wooo! You know why? Because EVERYBODY wins something! Ha ha! Ha ha!**  **voodoobreath**, you too get Random Surprise Prize Pizzas, because I liked your submissions (but it took me a while to 'get' get them, sorry)! And I'll get your $7.99 'zas in motion as soon as I hear from you.    It's that time again, when I have the urge to give away a pizza, while also turning it into a mildly evil little challenge. Because that is my idea of fun. Ha ha ha ha HAAAAA!     I’m a geeky person, or maybe I just like to think I am, and I like random artiness. I have a soft spot in my heart for the art mash-ups of my favorite shows/movies/books/etc which I see scattered all over the internet, all created by artists of various skill, age, and walks of life.  So the contest is this:   **Draw, sketch, electronically paint, photoshop (or similar), or doodle a mash-up drawing, sketch, electronic painting, photoshoppery image, or doodle about, including, or relating to *at least* two of the following:**    Doctor Who, Star Wars, Star Trek, Sherlock (any incarnation), Leverage, My Little Pony, Big Bang Theory, Avengers (both the British ones and the Marvel ones are cool), superheroes, Chrestomanci, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Psych, IMF, Buckaroo Banzai, Labyrinth, anime, superheroes, reddit, or anything reasonably recognizable as having a fandom.   Why those? Because those are my favorites that I could think of off the top of my head at the time I wrote this. If you have a great idea for something not on the list, and worry I might not "get" it, let me know what show or comic or whatever it is and I’ll get myself as much up to speed on the subject as possible before the close date so your contribution gets the fairest shot possible.   **Loose-ish Rules**  1. ALL skill levels welcome.  2. Contest open to US redditors who are any age IRL, but whose accounts are at least two months old and whose RAoP histories aren't mostly about getting pizza and not thanking anyone. I like manners. Manners are nice.  3. Any approach is fine (excepting exceptions below). I’m particularly a sucker for: funny, cute, clever, epic-ish, thought-provoking, action-adventure-y, twists, suspense, or all of the above.  4. Any style is fine (excepting exceptions below). This is *not* a beauty contest. Draw/create/etc. according to your ability, and maybe keep it to something you can do in under a couple of hours. After all, in this contest, a stick figure cartoon with a caption blurb could win out over anything Van Gogh's ever done. It is for fun and pizza! Please don't drive yourself bonkers over that.  6.  Submit as many submissions as you like until the contest closes.  7. If someone submits something that breaks a rule, you spot it before I do, and you feel compelled to say something - please do so nicely. Everyone is welcome to re-work any of their submissions until the contest closes.  8. Submit links to your artwork here, so everyone can enjoy them.  **Rules the breaking of which will result in immediate disqualification**  1.  Keep it safe for all ages. No porn, no gore, no swearing, no drugs, no nudity/nearly nudity, no suggestive anything, no mean-spiritedness, no R-rated anything (well, except for Die Hard. Die Hard’s awesome. But still try not to traumatize the kids).   2. No trolling, bullying, name-calling or nasty behaviors of any kind, including the sneaky passive aggressive kind, ’cause that’s just not cool. Do your best to be excellent to each other.  3. No submissions from accounts that are as many days old as this contest - or less - will be accepted.  4. No representing someone else's already-published work as yours. Plagiarizing is *bad*. Plagiarizing for pizza is bad and sad.  5. No bullying the winners. The contest owner also prefers not to be razzed, but if I missed something I'm open to constructive criticism, and will adjust as needed.  7. No trying to gain an edge on everyone else by sharing your sob story.  8. No breaking the law! Banksy's cool, but if you don't have the property-owner's permission, put the aerosol paint down and back awayyyy from that wall.   **The following are the prizes**:    **The Champion**, to my favorite submission of all: One large 3 topping pizza from Papa John's, for delivery or carryout.   **You’re Number Two!** My 2nd favorite: The best pizza that can be had for $15 from a franchise near you   **Third One’s the Charmer** I like it and so do your fellow contestants/redditors. Woohoo! This’ll go to the one with the most upvotes (after the ones previously rewarded): The best pizza that can be had for $10 from a franchise near you.   **Possible Random Awesome Surprise Prize Pizza**: This one is a maybe. It's a thing I like to do sometimes IRL, but it depends on how a particular event goes. The two hints I'll give on it are: even redditors who have no entries in this contest have a chance at it, and it's not a random lottery.  **Contest ends:** Next week at 8pm (MT) on Friday, September 28. Winner of the Papa John’s pizza will be notified by PM on the 28th, and will have 24 hours to respond. This is because that prize is being paid for out of the ‘free’ points I got from a Papa John's deal. The points expire on the 30th, so if I haven't heard from you by Saturday, I'll move on for my own peace of mind. Everyone else can take up to a week after being notified to get back to me on where to send the pizza/card.  **TL;DR:** Contest to draw a mash-up involving geek pop culture, any age OK, keep it clean, have fun, three main prizes with qualifying winners will be announced on the 28th, possible 4th pizza depending on how things go; oh, and all creators retain full rights to their work.

t3_1075ei	1348158171.0	shavill82	pizza	[Offer] CANADA ONLY - Food for your thoughts, must be starving not hungry	OFFER DONE!! I've sent Dauss some funds to pick up some cheap groceries to last a few days longer than a pizza!  Not sure how to flare but sorry I'll keep you posted when I'm able to help again!   Hey everyone!     I've hit hard times in the past couple of months. Even though I'm still stuck in bed from fractured ribs I've had amazing Redditors who helped me out during my times of need.       I'm not a billionaire or a huge money maker. I'm just an average Jane just like most people. I know what it's like to look at your pantry and decide if peanut butter would be good with pasta. Honestly... It's rough.     So to cut to the chase I obviously want to pay it forward today. I'm offering to buy someone dinner. I know this is a pizza thread but I'd rather feed you for a few days rather than a few hours.    And I'm sorry that this offer is only available to Canadians but I don't feel 100% comfortable with over the border assistance.       This offer is for those who honestly have no other source at the moment to get food. I know food banks are probably embarrassing but sometimes people have to qualify for that service. Sorry for the long post but I'm currently on high levels of medication.       So tell me your situation, story, and prove to me that you're really in need. I can only choose one person to help. I wish I could help everyone but just like you my funds are limited.  	1348186145.0

I will work with the funniest entry to get you pizza.  It has to be from a place where I can order online to be delivered to you, so you also have to be willing to share your address.  I reserve the right to exclude entries for whatever reason (mostly to exclude scammers or people who get pizza'd too often, don't feel like spelling out exact criteria).  Closes at 9pm EST.  Edit to add: please be ready to answer PMs interactively at 9pm (EST).  I'm not going to wait too long for responses before I move down the list.

t3_zxki9	1347729006.0	shayz	pizza-gold	[Offer][Contest] Kansas City Metro - Papa John's	Being fairly new to Reddit, I just happened to come across the Random Acts of Pizza subreddit and think it's a really neat idea.  I have been pretty fortunate lately, and would like to pay it forward, what better way than with a pizza?   So, in an attempt to get more people involved, here is my first contribution in the form of a small contest. It's pretty simple.   1) Post a photo of you doing something random around Kansas City. It doesn't have to be anything special, but it wouldn't hurt either. If it is not obviously clear that the photo was taken in/around Kansas City, then include the location as well.   2) The photo with the most upvotes at 5PM CST wins a $15 dollar e-gift card to Papa Johns. If by some chance all upvotes are equal, then the first person that posted will win. Simple right?   ** I'm sorry to those of you who are not in Kansas City, but I intend to x-post this to the KC subreddit and it just makes more sense to do it locally first. I will likely do another soon and depending on how this one goes, may change it up a bit.   -------------------------- EDIT Please see my comment posted below for the results, the contest has ended.	1347753152.0

t3_zwdqn	1347660981.0	Cinsare	PIF	[Request] Fellow user screwed me out of pizza... Story and warning inside. (In Canada!)	So, here's what happened... I was blessed enough to be given a Dominos card by the wonderful Abrahm_Smith not to long ago. Sadly, the card was only good in The States so I contacted Canada's Dominos and they were willing to issue me a $20 Canadian Dominos card as a trade! However, before I had heard back from the wonderful folks there I had made a Request post on here for pizza and promised to pizza-it-forward with the card. At that point I was contacted by a user, ***thetldrrules*** and he offered me a trade - the e-card for his sending a pizza my way. We chatted for a good while and I agreed. He went so far as to bully up a fake confirmation code and to find out the local pizza joint and specials. The user had me utterly convinced that he had made the order so I sent him the card info.  No pizza came. I called the store and no order had been placed. I spoke to the rep at Dominos and, though sympathetic, she was unable to help. I have messaged thetldrrules a number of times to no avail. I was an idiot.  So here we are, about 5 days after the events. I'm hungry, I'm broke (we're talking less than $2.00 in the good ol' account) and there's only so much KD and canned soup one can take. I would love a pizza to brighten my spirits (please and thanks) but more than that, I want everyone to know about thetldrrules.   Thanks for listening! :)	1347661170.0

t3_zptug	1347383585.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	[META][BRAINSTORMING][THE STATE OF RAOP] Donation links? 501(c)(3)?  Other ideas?	I know I have been low key for a while (I mostly like giving anonymously).   But RAOP is never far from my thoughts.  I have been thinking about a couple of ideas for RAOP for a while.  I have discussed this a bit a couple of times in the IRC channel.  (Everyone really should come hang out there... I'm on that chat channel all day during the work week along with lots of other awesome RAOP folks).  Anyway,  1) What do you guys think about adding some sort of Donation link to accept donations that we could then use for giveaways?  The reddit admins have added a couple of solutions that would let us do this.    Some of the ideas we've had is we could hold weekly/monthly giveaways, or use the donations to find un-filled requestors.  2) I have also thought about forming a 501(c)(3) charity that would allow donations to RAOP to be tax deductible at least in the US.    So let's use this thread to discuss these ideas and any other ones.    EDIT:  Ok after some discussion, what I am leaning towards is a 501c3 to bring in some tax benefits to givers along with personal liability protections for the people running it.  A donation link to the 501c3.  And a open accounting method with 100% going to the charitable purpose (admin costs donated so they will be 0).  Then we'd take those funds, as they allow, have a big giveaway thread to bring in more of the Reddit community, where the receivers are chosen randomly.  ... perhaps with some eligibility going to those that have given before... or some other combination.	1347411918.0
t3_zp626	1347348255.0	psm321	psm321	[OFFER] Let's play a guessing game	**CLOSED**  I'm working on processing the entries...  I'm thinking of a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) **Example of a real number** (since I've been asked and have answered, have to share with everyone): 0.5  PM me your guess and post something (a joke would be nice) here.  (The joke part is optional and not part of the game, would just be nice, but you do have to post something.)  Do *not* post your guess here.  I will pick the closest one that also follows the rules around 9pm EST tonight (Tuesday).  Winner gets $25 gift card to pizza place of their choice (as long as I can buy it online).   **Rules:**  * USA only  * Message your guess to me and post something here.  Do not post your guess here.  * Please only one guess with one account per person (I realize I have no good way to enforce this)  * Must not have gotten pizza'd here in the past 2 weeks (I don't know how to check, please be honest/self-police)  * Must have had Reddit account for at least 6 months  * Must have a reasonable amount of posting history in non-assistance subreddits  * I will need a verification code from the verification system (**only from the winner**)  * Any exact ties (unlikely) will be resolved in favor of the earlier guess  * I reserve the right to exclude anyone for other reasons if something comes up that I didn't think of.  * Optional: it would be nice if you could share a picture of your pizza(s) when you get them.  * Include in your guess message the following phrase: "I read all the rules"  Yes, I realize I don't pass a few of these rules myself. :)  10am edit: add clarification that I only need a verification code from the winner, and add an example of a real number.  Edit2: **Please read the rules!**  I have received way too many submissions that don't follow the rules.  I do intend to stick to the plan of awarding to the closest guess *that follows the rules*, even if it's not the closest guess overall.  Edit3: stats time!  There were 40 total entries/attempted entries.  Of these:  * 1 did not send a message  * 6 did not post here  * 20 did not include some variation of "I read all the rules" in their message.  This number goes up to 25 if I'm strict about the exact phrase.  * 3 have not been members for 6 months  * I deemed the posting history outside assistance subreddits to be insufficient for 4 entries (I was pretty lenient here I think)   Edit4: more stats (I promise, winner(s) coming up soon):  * This leaves 13 entries that follow the rules (9 if I'm strict on the exact "I read all the rules" phrase)  * There were 6 guesses outside the [0, 1] range.  2 of these would have otherwise been valid entries.  Edit5: **The winners!**  * I am awarding this to 2 people.  I had decided to allow slight variations on the "I read all the rules" wording.  The closest otherwise-valid guess came from someone with one of these variations.  I decided that to be fair I also need to award the person who was closest and EXACTLY followed the rules.  * The winners still need to give me their word that they followed rules 3 and 4.  They have been messaged and have 24 hours to claim their prize.  I will post their names and guesses after the prizes are claimed.  If unclaimed after 24 hours (or they fail verification), I will move down the list.  * The secret number was 0.4011844879734216, brought to you by the good folks at random.org  * Oh, and I can't resist one more stat: 4 people guessed some variation of pi (2 guessed actual pi, and 2 pi/10 which actually fits in [0, 1] 	1347415227.0

Well, I have had a serious run of awful luck lately, and between my inability to find consitent work and a frightenly empty wallet, and a computer that decided to develop the digital equivalent of Tourets, I think the only thing that could possibly lift my spirits would be pizza.  Though, to be more serious, I have been unemployeed for about four months at this point, and am becomming quite frightened at my financial situation.  I have always tried to keep in good humor about all of the troubles that come my way, but now I am starting to feel my burdens like never before.  I may be smiling, but I am not happy.  I was shown this group by a sympathetic ex-girlfriend, and am blown away.  Anyways, I have barely eaten in the past four days, and my options are more and more limited, and if anyone out there would be willing to find me a pizza, I would dance for joy.  I have to use my iPod Touch for internet, so it is very awkward (like the wording of this request) for me to use this website, but I shall persevere.  Anyways, if anyone out there wants to help this sorry sack of, um, something sorry that fits in a sack, I would be much oblidged.	1347037049.0

Something that freaked you out and you could not explain. Please do not make up a fake story. - Whoever has the best story will win the pizza! I will give it 24hrs before I pick the winner! Good Luck to all! :)** 	1346834286.0

t3_zar3a	1346705502.0	Rollout	Rollout	[META] Changes	Most of you know I was going to go. Many have encouraged me to stay, and try to fix what I see wrong. Here we go...  Many people have complained about some things here. The RAOPBOT inaccuracy for one, removal of posts, and more.  While we all really applaud the work of the bot creator, the bot is gone. It was more annoyance than it was good to many. Perhaps in the near future we can come up with a way to duplicate a way to keep track. The flair system being updated with multiple mushrooms for receivers is one idea that I was thinking of.  Going forward, posts that are not formatted correctly will not be removed, instead (see the sidebar), they will be slightly smaller, and light grey. This makes them still clickable, readable, but should encourage people to format posts correctly without the need for moderator policing. Since this is an automated process it will be completely the responsibility of the poster to get it right.  In the start of this we did some things very differently. We let the community police itself up to a point. The community would downvote, or ignore users that they felt were taking advantage, or being dishonest. I would like to see that again.  The overriding rules here are to be nice, and remember that we are just talking about a pizza, it is most likely going to someone who needs/wants it. If someone does take advantage, oh well it is what 10 bucks or so?.  If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it. If you do not want to buy someone a pizza, then don't do it, don't even comment in the post. If you have some proof of a scammer, or a otherwise dishonest person, let the mods know. We are here to keep the peace, which includes removing the people starting witch hunts, and those taking serious advantage... Keep in mind that we do allow people to ask every couple days, as long as they are up front and honest about how many times they have gotten before (this in no way makes it so that you have to buy them a pie...)  Please remember that ultimately the gift of a pie is up to the giver, so is any research. If a giver does not look through a users history, see if they have been a redditor for a while, see that they post in just assistance type sites, use of the verification system, etc... It is all on them... It is up to them if they just want to give, or be cautious..  This is supposed to be a positive community, let's all do our part to make it that way.  More changes to come... Some quite big, like a community donation pool, with giveaways and such....  We always welcome suggestions, but keep in mind that the focus here is to not be a police state, and just keep us mods as peacekeepers. We tend to push people away when we go too far, thus the current changes we are making.   Edit: Also, as I noted in a comment below... Why is it that we give so much attention to these scammers? It seems that is one of the number one words around here. The majority of the people here are honest, and we should remember that. Do not let a few bad apples spoil the batch... 	1346719169.0

Imalaskan88 wins. PM me, dude or lady.  Mama always said you can't get anywhere in life by being lazy. I disagree. I played a facebook game where you click one button, and a virtual ball kicks through a goalpost (hopefully) and you win a gift card to pizza hut. I did exactly that, and now I'd like to give it away.  My contests are always crazy and stupid. Tell me how you're the laziest person out there, and I'll reward you with my gift card that I did next to nothing to earn. Examples are cool, so are pictures. Proof is always a big one for me, but I don't know how you'd show me.  We'll close it up today at 4:15 pm EST. That's when I leave work, and I want that lazy jerk that I pick to have dinner tonight.  Good luck, and keep it lazy!	1346444015.0

t3_ypi3j	1345746123.0	Talking_Head	pizza	[Request] I am feeling really down on the first anniversary of my wife's death.	EDIT: I should have said: North Carolina.  I will just repeat what I said in another post.  My wife and partner of 20 years died this month one year ago. I have been able to keep it together for the most part, but going from 2 incomes to 1 has left me living paycheck to paycheck. I am basically eating beans and rice when I can build up the strength to cook. But, everything I do reminds me of her since we always cooked **together** in our kitchen.  She was a wonderful person and a blessing to all that she touched (literally.) I miss her deeply, and today it feels like I just can't make beans and rice again. Or anything for that matter.  In any case, if you need proof here is her [obituary from a year ago.] Edited to take out the personal info.   Thanks in advance.  PS- I am a vegetarian but I do love cheese pizza or vege pizzas. I do have the name and number of a local pizzeria, but any chain will do as well. You can PM me for details.  PPS- I am sorry if I broke any rules or etiquette.

t3_ypgct	1345744570.0	Imalaskan88	FAP	[Offer] Cheese Pizza from PJ's	Edit: Code has been claimed! Sorry everyone, wish I could help more, but they only sent me one postcard :(  So I was surprised to get some snail mail today from Papa John's. Apparently my "last order did not meet their timely service standards" over a month ago. So they gave me a code for a free Medium Cheese pizza.  I don't really dig cheese pizza and it won't let me add any toppings, so I'm passing it on to one of you, as I am sure someone could use it.  I haven't decided how I'll choose, yet. I'm pretty uninspired and not very creative. Tell me your story, maybe a joke, post a link. Say you want a pizza, I don't know ;) Totally unrelated info but I'm a hardcore gamer. Breaking WoW til mop, been DotA'ing it up lately...  I'll pick someone at around 6pm central.   Sorry, but it does not cover delivery! So either you have to cover delivery fee/tip, or have to pick it up in person.  Edit: Code has been claimed! Sorry everyone, wish I could help more, but they only sent me one postcard :(	1345762393.0

The winner was KimBERLY71!**  Thank you to all the creative and awesome redditors who have been a part of our past contests, and thank you for participating today!  I am from [Eat24.com](http://Eat24hours.com), a website where you can order food online from restaurants that deliver in the United States.  You probably get hungry (if not you may be a robot) and we are here with delicious noms when you do (we have nothing against robots 10101011000).  Reddit, you are awesome and we are excited to come back every Tuesday and do our contest here at RAoP.  **Rules:**  * Come to our website [Eat24.com] (http://Eat24hours.com) and search by your address to make sure we deliver to you.  If we don't list any restaurants in your area, let me know and we will try to find some to add to our site along with any restaurant recommendations you may have.  (All your recommendations are forwarded to our restaurant team.  Please be patient with us, as our fingers are made of tamales.)  * Something’s different about you. Is that a new sweater? Did you get taller? Are you even more devastatingly beautiful than before? Now, at this point, (because you are brilliant,) you're probably wondering, "Why are they blowing all this smoke up my (totally hot) butt?" To which we say, "Smoke? Butt? Whatever might you be speaking of?" But you see right through us, because, as we mentioned before, you are brilliant.  So brilliant, we are sure you can impress us with a food related pick up line.  **Examples:**      * Would you be my love buffet? So I can lay you out on the table and take what I want?     * I’d like to curry your samosas.     * I want to melt in your mouth, not in your hand.  * We will be choosing a winner today at 4:00 PM PST.  Please help us choose by upvoting your favorites.  * Comment as many times as you want.  * Please upvote this post.  This is not a requirement, it is a request.  We love giving away free pizza, and we also love getting attention.   Please upvote this post so we can gain as much visibility as possible on reddit.  When a winner is decided, I will PM you with a $25 coupon* **(requires a valid credit card or paypal to use.  The coupon code will expire in 2 weeks.

I have just received two gifts, and would like to pay one of them forward. I'd either like to give you the amazon gift card, but seeing as how this is Random Acts of Pizza, if there is a way to trade with someone for a pizza gift card, then I can send that pizza card along to someone else.  Any ideas?  If you want to just take the Amazon card, let me know why you want or need it/what you plan on using it for. I'm not necessarily looking for the saddest story, but I'm not sure what I will go for yet.  **EDIT: I have received quite a few PMs, I'm just going through the last of them and will be giving the gc to someone shortly.

That is, this is a little bit of a *contest* for a pizza that my mother and I are offering. I told her about RAoP, and she came up with a brilliant plot. Simply enough, all you have to do is tell us your best (or favorite) joke.   **In your best Shakespearean style.**   You have up to three minutes of acting time (we want you to get your pizza in time for dinner, and we have to watch the entirety of the videos). Put it up, leave a link in the comments, and upvote your favorites!  We will start going through the videos around 1800EST, and depending on response, we should have our winners chosen and pizzas sent by 1900EST.  Alas, poor Yorick, thy skull is optional in these bewitched portraits.  Good luck!  **Edit:** Crucial detail! Pizza joint of your choice, folks. We'll be doing it the ["Best Practices"](http://randomactsofpizza.com/info.html#best) way, so check the list of [eGift Card joints](http://randomactsofpizza.com/info.html#cards).

t3_y5zgv	1344893393.0	latenightfapper	pizza	[Offer] Pizza(s) to help me with my job, please!	Hey guys,   It's my first post so I'll try to keep it short and sweet, but this is mainly a test to see if it can lead to bigger charities. I work as a marketing associate for a website called www.Fantapper.com; it's new and we're just starting up so we need some traffic. Anyways, I'd appreciate it if you guys can help me out by going there using the link below  http://taps.la/raop  and create an account (1 minute of your time. it's really that quick). Afterwards, just fan the "Random Acts of Pizza" channel and "tap" (post) a photo (any will do, but I would love to see some of your guys' work since I know there are a lot of struggling artists on here) along with your reddit username so I can contact you for the pizza.  This is coming out of my pocket so I can't donate too many pizzas just yet, but I'd love to get support from my workplace and continue to do this on a regular basis. But more importantly, I'd like to move onto non-profit charities (with the same idea) if this all works out. Thanks!  TL;DR - Go to http://taps.la/raop , create and account, fan the channel, post a picture. Should take about 5 minutes of your time. Will check back in about an hr or so :D  *Edit: wolfamonglilacs got the first pizza. Please continue to sign up with www.Fantapper.com and and post your photo to the "Random Acts of Pizza" channel as I will offer out another pizza sometime this week after my paycheck comes in :D Thanks, guys. 	1344910755.0

Enjoy tonight!	1344766129.0
t3_y23jm	1344711211.0	BARON_OF_BACON	pizza	[Offer] US Only - Families, single parents, couples...in need of a night off from cooking?	**EDIT:  I'm placing the last of the orders I can do.  I apologize to all that I couldn't get to.  Keep trying, I'll have contests coming up soon.**  I'm looking to give out 3 large papa johns pizzas and maybe some other goodies to up to 3 people who PM me.  No gift cards, this will be for Papa Johns only (there will have to be one that can deliver to you).  I will pre-order and have it delivered TONIGHT ONLY, at a time we negotiate.    In your PM, do yourself a favor and include some background info, like how big your family is, or how you and your SO just need a hassle-free date night.  I am a compassionate Baron, but don't embellish the sob story FFS...just be honest and take the time to read below, to increase your chances of being considered:  **My rules are:**  -Couples and families only.  I might ask for proof, if I find this hard to verify.  -PM me once.  I will PM back if you are considered. Offer ends tonight.  -The decision is MINE ALONE.  (I tend to screen people I don't trust...don't take it personally).  -If you give me and address with no nearby papa johns, I will find someone else.  -I require a picture of the people getting to enjoy the pizzas.  Say what you will about my motives, but it helps an Offerer to feel like they weren't scammed after all is said and done.  I'd love to keep doing more offers, and being gracious will make me want to give more!  And, if you don't want to post your picture here, you can always PM or email it to me.	1344724827.0
t3_y1n9f	1344687598.0	Rachel707	pizza	[OFFER] Contest ending 8/11/12 at 1:30 pm for delicious Papa Johns!	Update: Results are in: rdowntime won the challenge and I gave $10 honorable mentions to justbeingkat and HeeroJay since they seem to really know their Z-day plans.   You guys are awesome and I had a great time reading all the entries! I wish I could give more awards away today!!!   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Okay after giving away 2 pizzas so far I am ready to gift some more but I should get something in return right?    I assume zombies will take over the earth at some point so I need to know I am sending delicious pizza to someone with a well thought out zombie survival plan.   In order to win a pizza dinner tonight (I'll set the time whenever you request) I'm going to need to know what you are going to do when zombies attack and can my band of Z-Day survivors get safe passage through your city?  I'll PM the winner around 1:30 pm today.   Edit: I should mention 1:30 pm EST. I am loving the entries so far. I will have a tough time finding a favorite :)	1344709850.0

It's been awhile since I've had an offer due to said move. For this, you'll have to tell me a story of when you thought things were going to go terribly wrong, but turned out better than expected.   My next offer should be more entertaining again. Just have to think of something.  *Edit* Forgot to say how long this is open for. Basically, whenever I feel like it. But you probably won't get the pizza tonight, more for tomorrow.  **Edit 2** Offer has gone out to truebluebrewcrew	1344744878.0
t3_y0taa	1344640516.0	Nerflet	pizza	[Offer] British Nerdfighters	Since none of my fellow Cam students want to sup tonight, I'm opening my pizza offer up for any Nerdfighter in the UK who has a Dominos in their town and wants pizza between now and 5am.  I request that you are familiar enough with John and Hank's videos to answer a basic question about Nerdfighteria in the PMs.  Thanks :)  EDIT: That's a rap, guys!

t3_y0096	1344612259.0	Co0jq500080style	shroom	[Request] Under a bridge for a month	UPDATE: Thank you for being here Reddit. I went to the food bank for a few hour wait and ended up with some non perishables. I gave the perishables to some lady with kids cause they wont last outside. Now to find some sort of can opening device. Im thinking my pocket knife will work. (A)  Yeeeep. So Ive been sleeping under a bridge for a month carrying around my netbook in a little bag and using the wifi at a coffee shop. Its been raining the last few days but except for the spiders my little alcove under the bridge has been fine. To date noone has found me yet though several people have walked literally right over me during the night.  I would appreciate a pizza but Im not sure where it would get delivered to. So...yeah.  I, uh, HAVE received a pizza before. I hoped some day to PIF but evidently I have no clue how to get by in this world. Thanks.	1344622097.0

t3_xyh7e	1344543537.0	poisonjammer	shroom	[Request] Not in dire need, but I sure am tired of eating ramen.	So my girlfriend and I quit our abusive fruitloops job (we worked at the same place) in order to keep ourselves sane (check out my legaladvice post on the no 15 minute paid breaks for smokers thing) although we both already have new jobs.  Mine doesn't start until the 13th, hers doesn't start until the 20th.  We're not homeless and destitute, but we have both agreed that we can't really afford to spend any money until paychecks from this new job come in as we still have rent and the electric due and the money we have + our last checks from that crappy job will cover it.  So we've been eating all the stuff we bought from the grocery store during happier times that we never really wanted to eat: Ramen noodles (cooked and crunchy), weird off brand organic cereal, cornbread with macaroni and cheese in it (i'm getting creative), grilled cheese and tomato soup (which was actually pretty darn tasty, but it was shredded cheese so the cheese to bread ratio was iffy).  Anyway, basically I really wanted some pizza, and I remembered that I had enough Papa Points for a free one.  Only I didn't, I had 24 points, and after a bit of argument it was decided that we really didn't want to take the chance buying a pizza for a free pizza later in case something weird came up where that 12 bucks would be better spent.  So I posted on facebook, looking for someone to bring me a pizza (frozen or otherwise) and a fellow redditor friend directed me to RAOP. After careful deliberation, I figured why not.  TL;DR - There are probably more deserving folks on this subreddit, but I just really want a freakin' pizza.  EDIT - And freakin' pizza was delivered!  <3	1344552331.0
t3_xxic0	1344499693.0	mushroomswiss	pizza-gold	[Meta] To the Mods, Just a thought.	Recently used www.eat24.com and thought it would be nice if you guys added it to the sidebar.   * Givers can use paypal when making their order, It solves the problem of canadians not being able to give to americans (and vise versa?) * Givers can tip the driver on the site, in case the receiver is too broke to do it.  * The makers of eat24.com hold contests here all the time so I think they deserve some promotion too. * Less "paypal money in exchange for a pizza e-gc" threads maybe?  That's all, thanks.	1344535306.0
t3_xtz7j	1344360524.0	CarefreeCG	pizza	[Offer] US  $50 pizza party from either Pizza Hut, Dominos, or Papa Johns	****  I just realized that in order to give myself time to actually get ready and get to work, I need to choose someone earlier than I had planned.  Thank you all for your stories!  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.  Everyone had amazingly awesome stories, and I will be doing this again in a couple weeks.  For now, I am going to go with the birthday boy's Justin Bieber experience.  What a mortifying first day of school, and it seems, today is his birthday, so CONGRATS Ilivelaughlovetoday. ******   First go at this, but after reading through a few pages, I think I know how it goes.  Up for grabs is a single $50 pizza party.  Rules:    You have to agree to spend the entire $50 in one order.  Invite some friends or family over, really ENJOY it.  I want someone who will agree to post several pics of this pizza party.  I'm having a pretty quiet couple of weeks, let me live vicariously through you and make me laugh.  Now, for the real fun part.  I want stories of your most embarrassing moments.  The person who makes me cringe in sympathy will get this pizza party.    I realize it's a Tuesday afternoon and kind of dead, but let's see what we can come up with.  I have to leave at 5pm Central time, so you have 4 1/2 hours.  TL;DR:  Read it :)  EDIT:  AFTER READING A FEW POSTS DOWN, IT APPEARS BOTH DOMINOS AND PAPA JOHNS HAVE 50% OFF DEALS GOING, SO THIS COULD BE $100 IF ORDERING FROM THESE PLACES!	1344372039.0

t3_xtln2	1344346272.0	BunnyLoverM	shroom	[Request] The last request failed. Lets see if my luck has changed.	Hey __name___. We're friends are we not? We've had some good times and bad times.  Since we are so close, can you do me a favor and hook me up with a pizza?   I know it's a lot to ask, but I was there for you when __a life event__ happened. I figured you could pay it back. by the way how is __significant other or family member__?  Love your friend, BunnyloverM   **edit**: Ok, I don't understand the downvotes. I was trying to be unique and avoid the usual sob story type post while making a joke. But since that's apparently what you guys want I'll indulge you. Last week my 56 year old father had a fairly severe stroke. I've never seen the man so week. He can barely talk, he can't swallow anything but soft foods and walking is out of the question. He's still in the hospital. I've been back and forth since that day has happened and have lived off hospital cafe food and what I have in my pantry here.  I made this post wanting to avoid telling that, because I believe people shouldn't use tragedy for personal gain. I was just looking for a pick me up and something to live on other than the meager rations I have at home. The gas from going back and forth is draining my bank account. I foolishly thought, trying to be unique here would A. Give me a better chance of actually getting something and B. Be appreciated more by the people who peruse these threads.	1344362766.0

t3_xst0j	1344304216.0	buttercup_mauler	PIF	[Thanks!] Thanks to elgreco927 for the gift card!	Thanks for my delicious pizza dinner box that I was able to buy thanks to elgreco927.

I just recently got a job after moving here a few weeks ago, and haven't been paid or had any money at all to spend on decent food. Even worse, I suffer from Crohn's disease, and not eating is making my stomach flare up like you wouldn't believe. I could really, seriously use the food right now. Thanks for the consideration.

Yes, I'm lazy.  Prize - $20 eGift card to one of the 3 major chains  Who - Random pick by me, be willing to verify using the process to the right  What do you have to do? - Post a picture of your most valuable possession with your username and the date in it. It doesn't have to have a dollar value, just valuable to you. Also, I'd like you to post a pic of your 'za when it arrives! Even better would be a pic with the delivery person, if they will. That might get a few random people to smile that see it on here.  :)  What will make you not pick me right away? - You never using the site except for to ask for help in the various subreddits that were intended for fun, not sob stories every 10 minutes. Down on your luck stories don't do much for me either. I have compassion and love to help people when I can, but I tend to find that surrounding myself with more positive people creates a nice, drama free lifestyle.  When does it end? - Lets say 6PM EST. That should be an acceptable time for someone to be around and have time to order dinner.  I will ask that you only post if you are going to order tonight for dinner and be willing to post a picture once it arrives.	1344117681.0

Simple, post in here. I will then take all your names and put them in a random picker machine thingy and if your name comes up, you will receive a pizza! YAY PIZZA! Winner will be drawn tomorrow (8/1) at 6pm CST.  **DON'T POST YOUR SOB STORIES I DON'T WANNA HEAR THEM! THIS IS _*RANDOM ACTS OF PIZZA*_ NOT SOB STORIES ACT OF PIZZA!** That'll be all.

So if you're any of those three people, just no.  For those of you wondering why I have banned these 3 guys, here's why. All 3 of them have offended me in some way in this subreddit. Whether it was by promising pizza and not delivering, or receiving pizza from me and not having the courtesy to thank me. Either way, they contributed to my long absence from this subreddit and are therefore automatically disqualified.  EDIT 2: Since so many people have entered, and trust me I was not expecting this many people to do so, I have decided to give pizza to TWO (2), count them, TWO (2) lucky winners! So keep entering your names and may the pizza odds be ever in your favor!  EDIT 3: Holy mother of baby Jesus... I really was not expecting this many people. I'm gonna have to set a cut-off time.

Anyone who posts after that... Well, maybe next time.  **4TH AND FINAL EDIT:** 4PM CST IS HERE!!!! AND THE WINNERS ARE....

If I get any outside proof I will award the pizza to the first to get it to me!   Thanks for looking, guys.    Hello, RAOP! I haven't gifted in a while, but I'm trying to get creative here.   First step: Go over here and please *read* and upvote this post. Comment, too, if you don't mind, just because that also shows you're in it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/xb7yb/please_help_my_friend_with_lung_cancer_try_and/  Second step: Use any avenue you have -- twitter, facebook, subreddits, irc, ICQ, smoke signals, whatever you have at your disposal to try and get the word out there.

Then shoot me a PM with any relevant pictures or links.  Step quatro: Of the submissions I receive, I will pick one person who seems to have gone above and beyond to promote this cause. I will also draw a name at random and that person will get a giftcard to a local pizzaria of their choice (that is in the US and takes online pay).  So there are two ways to win: One is to be a super-influencer, or at least a really hardworking one. The second is to get lucky.  Open until, umm, Tuesday at midnight EST.   Please help me out on this, RAOP, and I will pay it forward in delicious gooey pizzaness!  Oh, also, thanks!    **ETA: New link for a new tweet. This one is more succinct, I think, and has a hashtag. :)**   [Link!](https://twitter.com/margiecakes/status/229664287210229760)     	1344048505.0

t3_x9wor	1343433485.0	inflexiblemadness	PIF	[REQUEST] CA, USA - My wife got mugged on her way to work this morning (she's fine, but they took her iPod) and then got laid off at the end of her shift.	She was biking to work this morning at 4 AM and a car blocked off the bike lane and demanded her phone. She gave them her iPod (not iPhone, thankfully) and they sped off. She'd only had the job for a week. We had just gotten laid off at the same time and she had landed this great job. $12/hr. with 48 hour weeks (so lots of OT), full benefits, and all that good stuff. It was a great job for her as it would let me go back to school full time while working part time and get that finished. Then today she was told she was "not meeting performance standards...we are shuffling things around and reevaluating and since you are one of the newest people we have to let you go."  So now we are back to being broke.  And I have no idea what to say. I think a pizza would go a long way to cheering her up.  Edit: Just got a text from her and she apparently got a flat tire on the way home. Today is just full of win.	1343434035.0

t3_x9etl	1343415654.0	grahamsimmons	shroom	[REQUEST] Helped a cyclist out today in Southampton... did not go as planned.	So I'm financially a little shaky right now, as I don't start my new job until September and I just graduated. Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.      Shortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's "friend" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the "friend" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.  Naturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's "friends" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is "still on tag" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also "on tag". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.  By this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, "thanks anyway"s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.  Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!  EDIT: TL;DR, I helped out a criminal repair what was probably a stolen bicycle while surrounded by sketchy people and subsequently had to spend my dinner money on a replacement tool he broke so that I could fix my own ride.	1343416215.0

t3_x978t	1343408721.0	Imalaskan88	FAP	[Request] President of the Stuff Happens Club	I honestly don't know how it keeps happening. I set up a budget from week to week and somehow when rent time comes around, I seem to fall short.  I lose my debit card over the weekend. I keep thinking it will turn up.. but it doesn't. Got it cancelled, waiting on new one.   On Monday, my best friend calls me and says her account is over drafted, and she needs 40 bucks to avoid a fee. She's in pretty bad shape, and I always help her when she asks, if I can, and vice versa. I wire it to her.   On Tuesday girlfriend begs me to take her to see The Dark Knight. It's in the budget. We skip lunch/dinner due to refillable popcorn. Finish the day without going over budget.  On Wednesday, I get more Weird Charges on my [Bank account](http://redd.it/wnyj9). Turns out, my bank forgot to block further incoming charges from Target after they reversed my previous claim. Now I have to wait another 3-10 business days to get that back. It's about 75 bucks this time. Before i leave the bank, I withdraw all the cash from my account. Due to not having a debit card, and not wanting my money to continue to be eaten by random charges until it's all cleared up.  On Thursday I wake up to find my Landlord charged me $40 for a fee he forgot to post to my account last time I owed rent. That plunges my account into the negative and a wonderful overdraft charge from the bank.  I effectively get paid almost every Friday, but long story short, I am short on rent due to this crap, and i'm really not sure what to do tomorrow. I have the day off today, so I was going to wake up at 2am and walk to a Temporary Work agency that pays on the spot (doors open at 4am, first come first serve), but I woke up with a tense headache, a dripping nose, and swollen tonsils... Perfect time to get sick.   I'm thinking of calling up a well to do friend of mine and see if he can help.. again. Did I mention my [GRE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Record_Examinations) is coming up Tuesday and I don't think I'm ready for it? More stuff to stress over...  Anyway, as you can imagine, food got totally scrapped from the budget as of recent. I didn't eat at all yesterday, and this morning ate some noodles. A pizza would cheer me up considerably! I did sort of want to try some new concoctions they've had over ad pizza hut, and I'm pretty sure I have a PJ coupon lying around somewhere...  Thanks for reading. @_@ Happy Friday.   edit: if you'd like me to upload any proof of anything here, just let me know  edit 2: my well to do friend isn't responding. t minutes 2 hours 20 minutes until i get kicked out :-(	1343482835.0

I love hearing about it all.   Post pictures of your progress if you are comfortable and proud of yourself. I assure you this is a judgement free zone! Be vain in this thread though!

I don't have a whole lot of money, but I am offering a $20 gift card to a pizza place yet to be decided. I will say this is my first time giving pizza, so you might have to bare with me as I get the hang of it. Also, American only, as I'm not sure how to give internationally. Though if you can provide help on doing so, I have no problems with that either.  Curious about me, are you? [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/zaqcg), but the pictures are not in order. Just a few random ones. Let's see what you got!  EDIT: KEEP THEM COMING! I'll keep it open for another 24 hours and then I'll announce a winner. EDIT: Alright folks thanks for all the submissions!

t3_x38j3	1343159163.0	pookie85	FAP	[Request] There are two reasons I am requesting some pizza noms today in Corbin, KY.	My first reason is the same reason I have every other Tuesday or Wednesday, a few days before my paycheck gets to my mail box:  Groceries (what little there was of them) have disappeared and my stomach is beginning to protest.  As you know, I'll pay it forward. I do every other Friday and I am good on this.   My second reason is:  Tomorrow is my stepmom's birthday and we don't have the money to even get her a pie..yes, she requested pie for her birthday and I hate that I can't get her one on her birthday.  So I thought maybe I could make it up to her by having some Papa Johns instead until Friday can roll around.  As always, I know there are people who need it worse, and are much worse off than I am.  Any request that involves kids should be answered first.  We'd just like some noms as a whole here in my house today and I will most certainly pay it forward on Friday with a giftcard to someone else. <3  Thank you, RAoP for all of your amazingness. xx  **UPDATE** My brother, the amazing Jetboyterp who is not actually my brother but let's not get technical about it, has saved the day.  So thank you, Terpaderp. <3  	1343162098.0

t3_x2gdq	1343128532.0	threedice	threedice	[offer] $15 Little Caesars card - the "Stupidest Pop Song" challenge!	Okay, as promised, I've got a chance for you to win a $15 "Little Caesars" gift card.  And I want you to have some fun with this.  To win this card, post a video of yourself singing what you think is the stupidest pop song ever, and link that video to RAoP.  Make fun of that song.  Goof on it.  Make funny faces if you want.  Get your friends to sing backup.  Use puppets.  Do it a cappella, or get a whole band together.  Sing it with a karaoke machine or sing along with the real track.   You need to sing the song for at least 60 seconds.  And at the end of your performance, I need to hear you shout, in your best concert encore voice, "Thank you Threedice!"  Then post your video, or at least a link to it, in this thread.  Let's all have fun with this.  You want to goof on Carly Ray Jepsen?  Go ahead.  You still wanna challenge your inner Rebecca Black?  Let's hear it.  You think you can make me laugh with Nickelback?  I'm waiting.  Impress me.  The video that makes me laugh the most, the one that makes me want to re-wind it over and over again and laugh so hard, wins the Little Caesars card.  And depending on how many funny entries I receive, I might hand out more than one card.  I've done it before.  Give me a reason to do it again.  This is only open to United States RAOP members who have a Little Caesars in their area.  Contest runs until Friday, July 27 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, at which time I'll PM the winner (or winners) and give them the gift card code.  Let the singing begin!!  CONTEST IS CLOSED - Nobody entered their video.  Sadness.	1343422863.0
t3_x157m	1343072183.0	whyamithehump	pizza	[Offer] Scavenger hunt! US Only	Let's try something different. I'm going to post a list of items or locations or people. The first person to post an imgur album of as many of them as possible will get pizza from one of the big 3. You must verify they are original pictures by including your username somewhere in the post (yourself holding a piece of paper, etc). You can get creative, ultimately I will have final say about what qualifies and what doesn't. You do not have to complete the list, as that will probably be impossible. Let's see how you do. Given the time consuming nature of this contest, this will end THURSDAY giving you 3 days to complete as many as possible.   Here we go:  * A mandolin * A home depot hot dog stand * A coin from 1978 * A newspaper ad for a lingerie store * A handwritten family recipe for apple pie * A hairless (living) animal * A statue or sculpture related to space travel in a public place * A machete * A nintendo console predating the N64 * Twins or triplets * An animal not native to the US * A Sam's Club/Costco employee handing out samples * A bottle of leave-in conditioner * A man dressed in drag * A cucumber * A ball of twine * An empty aquarium * A group of 3 or more pugs * A meeting of the Red Hat Ladies * A venture scout * A copy of the Sega Dreamcast game D2 * A travel insurance form * A bloody mary * A fixed gear bike * An origami crane * A guestbook of a local attraction * A Justin Bieber trading card * Hershey's Kisses * A receipt for something under $1.00 * A receipt for a purchase exactly at noon * An Ikea * A windows phone * A bible with birth and death records for at least 3 generations * A completed jigsaw puzzle * A nook simple touch * An AOL free internet CD * An ice luge * A bottled of cupcake flavored vodka * Pogs. * An oversized version of a typical candy * Easy mac * A HAM radio * A TI-89 Calculator  GOOD LUCK!  EDIT: Seems to be a little confusion, you do NOT have to complete the list, just whatever you can and the person with the most wins. It's a fun, silly contest and many of them items are meant to be humorous, don't be Debby Downers over free pizza.	1343085388.0

This will be a contest. I'm going to make the decision tomorrow evening sometime (Sunday evening).   Whoever posts a piece of music that I enjoy the best gets an e-giftcard to one of the big three.

I'll post the winner Sunday evening!  EDIT 1: Sorry guys, I went out of town unexpectedly, and just now got back home, so I'm going through the videos right now. I'll notify and post the winner this afternoon when I get done going through them.  EDIT 2: Congrats to a_haar!

I'm currently broke and all my relatives are away till Sunday. All I have left is a bit of rice and kielbasa. Probably enough for the rest of today, but I don't know what I'm going to eat tomorrow.  My relatives are in a bit of a bind due to credit issues, so in general we are usually tight on money.  I'm starting work training for my new job next week (worried about talking about it due to NDA issues - similar to another post on Reddit that caused lots of issues for the guy who posted it).  If I could get just a pizza, even plain, the smallest size, it would be nice.  **EDIT** - Thank you [bearvivant](http://www.reddit.com/user/bearvivant) for providing me with a pizza in this time where I'm really down to little!

Today is my 25th cake day and it also marks my first payday at my new job (I'm a receptionist for a spa and Pilates studio!)   I had to work all day and I just got home, but before I go out to dinner, I want to give someone a random act of pizza because I know how it is to be without a job, or a college student, etcetc.  All you have to do is tell me about yourself and why you want a pizza (you don't have to be crazy detailed) and before I leave, I'll pick someone to order a pizza for!   By the way, if I leave before someone replies or enough people reply, when I get back from dinner I'll hop right on and pick someone.  Going to try and find a decent coupon code and help two people out if I can. :)  **update: imcummingforyou is the first winner. I'll be back around 1130pm EST and I'll pick one or two more.

t3_wppbd	1342549566.0	redditnoobie	PIF	[Request] SO and I are having a rough patch, and nothing is really working out properly. I'd love to surprise him with a pizza to help make his night/week better.	EDIT: I could have sworn I put Arkansas in the title :( We're in arkansas  My poor guy has been doing everything in his power to make our living situation better and he just can't seem to catch a break.   He finally got this bad ass job redoing a government website, getting paid $35 an hour, and everything was looking up. It's complicated, and I dont' even really understand it, but he and his friend were hired by the government, threw some recruiting company, but get paid out of some company in jersey. Anyway, there's all this bullshit going on and the company out of jersey are giving them the run around on paying them. We have a baby on the way, and my boyfriend has been seriously trying his damnedest to get us to a good place before the baby gets here. But he's just getting shit flung at him left and right. I've exhausted every source of help I can think of, and now we're talking about moving back in with his parents until he starts getting a regular paycheck in, which could be another month. Being almost 30, this isn't something that he's happy about, and I just want to help make his night better somehow.  I think I've asked for a pizza at least once a month for two months, but this one would be the cherry on the sundae. He mentioned last night how much he'd love to just come home and not have to worry about anything so I'm really trying to make tonight a special night for him. I can't do anything about our current financial situation, but I've been planning/doing all these little things to make his night better (changed the blankets and sheets, have his clothes laid out for him for tomorrow, have his favorite movie all picked out, planning a foot/back rub... ) and the only thing I can't work out is dinner. I know that he'd just flip ecstatic shit over not having to worry about going out to the grocery store tonight.   If anyone can gift us a pizza delivery from pizza hut tonight I'd be eternally grateful! They have that $10 box that's his absolute favorite aside from wings.   Thank you for reading. I know it's pretty long :/ I really need to work on that.    **Request fulfilled! Thank you  Solanumn!** 	1342557951.0

t3_wnyj9	1342474192.0	Imalaskan88	FAP	[Request] USA. Fun Fact: Bank of America > Wells Fargo	I never should've left! Opened a wells fargo account about 4 months ago for convenience since all my family members and friends had one.   Someone managed to get a hold of my card / forge my checks leaving me with a wonderful [negative balance.](http://i.imgur.com/208tP.jpg) Good job me not realizing this until yesterday.   With BoA, when you submit a fraud claim, they instantly reimburse you until the investigation is done. With Wells Fargo, I'm SoL until they're done... in 3-10 business days.  If someone could help out with dinner for tonight (or any night this week) I'd be pretty grateful! I have a bare pantry/fridge and exactly $4.45 until Friday, which will probably go to a loaf of bread, and peanut butter and jelly at the dollar store!  I will, of course, pay it forward as soon as I am able.   Edit: Apparently it wouldn't buy the pb&j, so stocked up on ramen. Mmm salty goodness :S	1342483677.0
t3_wnqyq	1342467376.0	Dapner	shroom	[REQUEST] Pittsburgh,PA Disabled but having fun redditing since this morning/A pizza would be nice for my family	This is my second posting today,my first one got deleted for some reason.Since I can't do much else,I've been redditing since this morning and have been having a blast.My favorite sub is Ask reddit.This site can be quite addicting.Anyway,a kind pizza gesture from a fellow redditor would be awesome.I can return the favor on August 1st when I get my SSI payment.Your consideration is greatly appreciated since we have little money or food in the house.	1342468986.0
t3_wneo8	1342456386.0	threedice	threedice	[OFFER] $20 Domino's GC to celebrate the big payoff!	So here's what happened.  Five years ago, I took out a loan to pay some major car repairs.  It took a lot of saving and scrimping and going without - the loan actually lasted longer than the car - but last Friday I not only paid off the loan, but paid it off FIVE MONTHS EARLY.  So to celebrate, I'm going to offer a $20 Domino's GC to one lucky RAOP resident.  Here's what I want you to do.  In this post thread, tell me the one debt owed by you - financial, emotional, personal or otherwise - that you have successfully paid off.  Was it a college loan?  Was it money your parents or a friend lent you?  Did someone help you out in a time of need and you found a way to return the kindness?  At 5pm (Eastern) Tuesday July 17, I'll look over the entries and select the one that really impresses me or catches my attention.  At that point, I'll contact the person and send them the codes for the gift card through DM.  United States residents only, and you gotta be near a Domino's that can deliver to you.  **UPDATE** Thanks for all the uplifting stories of the debts all of you have paid.  I only wish I had more cards to give out.  The winner of the $20 Domino's gift card is **Dapner**.  Enjoy the pizza!	1342558053.0
t3_wmajs	1342401025.0	vokebot	pizza	[Offer] TOMORROW 7/16/12, I would like to send 3 Dominos large 3-topping pizzas to three people in need. Carryout only so that I can provide for more people please.	This has been the worst week of my life but I realized I am blessed to be able to put food on my table until payday and I would like to pay it forward. Please post your desired location and desired time for your order to be complete. I am offering this for tomorrow because I know it is late in the day. I will notify the three people (to be selected at random by the responses... I am truly sorry but I am not sure of any other fair way to do this) tomorrow morning. All I need is a pick up time at a specific location, your name, and the options of your choosing (crust, sauce, etc) with the three toppings you would like. I hope there is no issue through the Domino's website to complicate buying three different pizzas and three different locations in the same day.   Should you encounter any problem and if I see that I haven't been charged, I will gladly reschedule your pizza and call them to sort out any issues.  **REQUIRED INFO**  1. Nearest Domino's location.  1. The time you would like to pick up your pizza.  1. Your name (send via PM, post the other three requirements here please)  1. Crust and sauce options with 3 toppings.  Hopefully I did this correctly. And again, this is for ***TOMORROW, Monday July 16.***    **EDIT 7/16, 10:10AM pacific**  I have chosen 3 people at random that I'm going to attempt to send pizza to today! In an effort to make things more convenient, I would like to send each of you an e-giftcard for $10. I know I asked for toppings and times, but I also know that sometimes plans change so I rather you have options. The $10 will easily cover the $7.99 large three topping carry out special that I was offering to begin with. Sorry for this being kinda sloppy, it's my first time doing this and I clearly didn't think it far enough through. At any rate, the three people receiving gift cards will be: sammynicxo, indianagirljw, and Call_of_the_Void. I'm going to PM all of you now so that I can get your email addresses! Have a great day everyone, be good to each other.	1342459191.0

t3_wjyro	1342284757.0	BlackMeddle	FAP	[Request] My sister is having a baby and I don't want my family to have to worry about dinner. 	EDIT: REQUEST FILLED.    Hello. So, I figure the title explains what's going on. We're kind of broke right now, and we still need to purchase a car seat for the child, so I am humbly requesting a pizza so that I can help get my family food without them having to worry about it later tonight. We suspect my sister's water broke this morning so we're going to head to the hospital.   I intend to return the favor to the community this weekend with some sort of contest - probably baby-themed because of the circumstances.   Either way, thanks for reading and considering. It's super super appreciated.  EDIT: Whoops, forgot to put the location. Dallas, TX.	1342306789.0

t3_whaw2	1342149871.0	MKandtheforce	PIF	[Request] (Maine) Would someone be willing to buy a girl some lunch tomorrow?	It's been over six months since my last request here... I was hoping I wouldn't have to ask anymore, but I really don't want to be stuck eating sandwiches for both lunch and dinner tomorrow. Or ramen. God, I'm sick of ramen.  I'm broke. I'm so broke that I don't even know how I'm going to afford gas to get to work tomorrow. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it, though. Anyway, there's a Dominos on the way to work and I would love to have a pasta breadbowl. They're cheap and delicious, and it would make eating a sandwich for dinner much more bearable. (The reason I'm eating the sandwich for dinner instead of lunch is because the Dominos is too far from my work to deliver, blargh). And, of course, I get out of work late. I haven't been able to enjoy a home-cooked meal in weeks because of a theater production I'm in. I'd just like to have something that's hot and yummy. :c  I pizza forward when I have money. Unfortunately, I'm now in a job where I don't work as much, heh. I'm willing to do verification of any sort, etc. And a hug. I will give you one in exchange for like, a $10 giftcard for Dominos.  Let me know if you can help. :c  EDIT: Thanks, I found a helper. This subreddit never ceases to be awesome.	1342153790.0

All right, so I've made a few RAoP videos in the past, and I've been slacking severely lately.  Who can participate?  **Anyone who posts a previous thank you picture (from the months of April to recent)**, OR if you just want to snap a picture right now, saying thank you to RAoP for being such an awesome community..that totally works!  In my opinion, thank you pictures have been dwindling in the past half year or so.  I don't see half as many as I used to, which is sad.  I understand some people don't have a camera and what not...but not even a thank you post.  That's not cool.  As a giver (it feels awesome to say that now), it's nice to see someone's smiling face enjoying the pizza you were able to provide to them.    So..Rules for the contest?  Post a picture with you holding a sign saying "THANK YOU RAoP!"  Or to someone in particular if you wish.  **Who can participate?**  EVERYONE IN RAoP!  Someone is going to get a pizza. : D [But you have to post a thank you picture!](http://i.imgur.com/MQwOk.png)  **The deadline?**  Friday night. 8:30 PM.  This will give me time to pick a winner and ship out a gift card, etc.  This is EST, so keep that in mind. **Please live in the states**, and if you don't..hopefully we can find a way around that!    **Note:** I am working on getting more givers involved with this so there may be a **chance** of more than one giftcard here.

t3_w5orv	1341623156.0	Truce_Giantmidget	PIF	[Offer] I've been pizza'd twice so far  heres one I can pay foward.	One of mine was from sob story the other was because I was taking my little sisters swimming. Somebody let me order pizza for them, and that put me over my points for papajohns. So I'm using them to pay a pizza forward. I'm the oldest out of 7 children between my mother and father. I'm 24 and the youngest is 7, and I love them very much especially doing things with them. For Independence Day I cooked tamales and the youngest wanted to help so I let her mix the dough. Then when it came time to assemble them I set her up a station next to me on the table, and taught her how to roll them up. The whole day after that she went around to everybody saying she got to make tamales with her favourite big brother. That is just one of the latest stories. Last halloween I made a Princess Mononoke costume that looked like San for another one of my little sisters. It was made with her red mask, white fur, and spear. I used a white ghost mask painted red and brown then attached it to a fake fur bathroom mat that you can find at walmart. For the spear I shaped the blade from foam, and wraped quater inch dowels with black ribbon. I could go on but that will take forever.    What you have to do for the pizza is tell your favourite story about what you have done for a sibling, cousin, or good friend that you think of as a sibling. Pictures would help but are not required. Tomorrow I'll choose somebody about 6pm est.  **UPDATE:** Gave the pizza to **Aesirr** because his story had 2 things i love Surprising sisters, and metal. He will be getting it at the store around 8pm. I couldn't afford delivery.  I wish i could give more but i'm unemployed so i cant afford it. Remember to love family and teach the younger generations to not cross family. I think of the crap my parents generation put themselves and us kids through and it sickens me. I would hate myself if i treated my sisters and brothers they way they did.	1341699111.0

t3_vzact	1341326475.0	_jeth	FAP	[CONTEST]  Paying it forward!  A pie in exchange for your worst first date story.  	So the other day I was the recipient of my first RAOP from Yunododat and as I was quite literally broke this weekend (and sick) it helped save my ass when my date refused to cancel because of my plague (so sweet) and it went so well that we were still hanging out late enough to need to order a pizza.    So long story short, RAOP helped me have an amazing night, but I know that it could have gone very, very differently.  So the contest I propose is as such:  I want to hear your absolute worst first date story in excruciating detail.  In exchange for your worst, most cringe-worthy story I will be awarding a $15GC to the place of your choice for the person whose story made me cringe and shriek the most.    Contest runs through 8pm CT on Tuesday, July 3rd.  One winner will be chosen by me.  Make me cringe, get a pie!  It's that easy.  :)))  Edit1:  Half an hour until I curb the entries and there have been some stunners so far.  It's going to be very hard to pick one winner, but you all have given me a lot of mirth on my breaks and on my work lunch today.  :D  Edit2:  Entries are closed!  (last contributor was ericasohodge)  I will go and read through them all carefully again and announce a winner as soon as I can make up my mind.  Some of these are downright BRUTAL.  You all have restored my faith that being a Socially Awkward Penguin is more common than you'd think.  :D  Edit3:  Okay, I want to stress that your entries were AMAZING and some of your experiences were BRUTAL.  From getting t-boned in intersections, finding out you were on a date with your teacher, to dead animal picker-uppers, it's clear that bad first dates do exist and if I had pizzas for everyone I would hand out pizzas for everyone!  But ultimately there were two stories that stuck with me as I kept reading through this, and so I asked a friend to come online, read them all, and tell me his honest opinion as well and he hit on the same two stories I did (without our discussing it previously).    So it is with great pleasure that I announce that we will have not one, but two winners and those winners are [crazyfordisney](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/vzact/contest_paying_it_forward_a_pie_in_exchange_for/c58zg2r) for vividly capturing what it's like to be on a date with a judgmental prick, and [sarahmj13](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/vzact/contest_paying_it_forward_a_pie_in_exchange_for/c58y4mv) who should NOT stop going to the coffee shop because of one awkward date, and whose story was way too close to my own last week (it would have been ramen in my house as well if I hadn't been gifted a RAOP).  Ladies, please message me with the email address where you would like your GCs sent to as well as your preference for restaurant (anywhere I can do an online GC - even a grocery store - is fine by me).  Thank you everyone for sharing, and hopefully I will be able to do this again soon!  :)))	1341365897.0

Nashville, TN	I highly doubt there's anyone keeping up with my shenanigans, but here's the latest installment of pure fml that's slapped me in the face. (Installment 1: 5 days without eating http://redd.it/vpme7 (Installment 2: memories of pies http://redd.it/vtavd  I got some coworkers at work to pitch in on a pizza for me for the week, since it was half off at Papa Johns. I was ECSTATIC (it being my first pizza in like a year) and it tasted amazing. It was quite hard to throttle myself to make it last ~4-5 days.  I went to check out some cheap apartments a coworker told me about... came back... and.. my pizza... was half on the floor... half in my dogs stomach. I was so sad. I don't have a fridge, so i stored it high up, but somehow he got to it.  Here's a pic of the little troublemaker http://tinypic.com/r/qssd5c/6  Tried calling papa, but they wouldn't replace it for me. I know this is my 3rd request but I honestly couldn't foresee this happening, and I thought someone here might be willing to help me out.  Thanks for reading  Edit: I wish i had taken a picture of the room when I walked in. It's pretty vivid in my mind lol. Walking in, and a pure sense of.. quite a lot of emotions, actually. I cleaned it up and didnt think about Raop til just a few minutes ago, but i can go fish the box out of the trash if you'd like ( Who throws away whole slices of pizza, right? )	1341270347.0

t3_vxlnv	1341250977.0	nuviiwillow	PIF	[Offer]  write me a note to hang on my door and you will get a gift card to Dominos!	I have the unfortunate circumstance of having my garage open onto a street that I don't actually live on... Imagine that I live on The corner of Apple ST and Banana ST my address is on 123 Apple ST but my garage is on Banana ST. As such I am constantly getting a flow of people coming to my house looking for 123 Banana ST (including pizza delivery and ups deliveries). Normally I just tell them where they went wrong and point them in the right direction... (explain that this is actually 123 apple and they want 123 banana her house is on that road about 10 houses down)  but recently I started babysitting a little 6 week old boy who is a very light sleeper. Anytime the door bell buzzes  or someone knocks he wakes up squalling. I am at my wits end.   What you have to do is write (type) me a note that I can post on my door. Explain what they did wrong. And how to fix it. It would be helpful if it said something about this not being Amanda's house that this is Nuviiwillow's house.   Something Liam Neesonesque a la Taken would be good too. And I am not above threatening to break fingers or arms as punishment for waking the baby.   Accounts submitting must be at least 6 months old.   Absolutely no sob stories. But stories of commiseration are welcome.  Sorry folks US only.   Must promise to post pics of pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If I can't make up my mind I will do runners up cards too.

t3_vxbyi	1341240723.0	Amardrius	shroom	[REQUEST] We're ridiculously sick of Ramen. We could WREAK a pizza. 	Pretty much what the title says. My dad and I don't make a whole lot and all we've been talking about all week is how much we're so unbelievably sick of ramen and 50 cent mac and cheese. We're not in any great need, we DO have food, but I figured it was worth a shot to post here and see if someone was willing to do us a favor and improve our quality of life for a day.   Note: I have a "got pizza'd" flair, it's from 11 months ago in case your curious.   Edit: We live in Utah.	1341246935.0

t3_vvpm3	1341155538.0	James1o1o	shroom	[Request] Pizza for dinner later tonight UK/Scotland	My mother is away on holiday for 5 days. Don't want to sound like she abandoned me or anything, I was happy to stay and watch our dogs. The only thing is, she didn't leave me money, instead she actually bought food at supermarket for me. She didn't realize though that the food she had left me wouldn't last the entire weekend because its now out of date. Not her fault if anything probably mine since I already ate the food that wouldn't be out of date on Thursday and Friday and left the now out of date food (stupid I know) and now I got no food or money until Tuesday. All I would be looking for is a plain margarita pizza.  It would be absolutely amazing if someone was to buy me a pizza for my dinner later tonight!	1341162736.0
t3_vtrkw	1341023844.0	_jeth	FAP	[THANKS] yunododat for cheering up my night!	I did not win the contest yunododat sponsored earlier this evening, but he was feeling generous and contacted me to offer me a pie after his evening plans got somewhat scuttled.  It was unexpected and very, very sweet.  :))  I have been sick the past few days and food (and cash) supplies have been low, so this is a real pick-me-up.   Thank you again for the generous offer!  I will be paying it forward in a few weeks.  :D  I'm already scheming what my contest will entail.    Edit:  I also will credit yunododat with pulling off some magic for me.  I had a date for Saturday and I was sad because my doctor couldn't confirm what I had and therefore I may, in fact, be contagious.  I explained it to my date fearing he would reschedule me, but instead he told me he has an amazing immune system and likes russian roulette so he's still coming for our date.  I may feel like blech, but I'm still going to get some cuddles.  I feel like these events are directly related, so thank you yunododat for pulling off another good deed for me!  Edit2:  My date went so well that we had to put the pizzas to use already last night.  They were delicious and they helped keep an already awesome date going strong.  :)))  I see him again on Tuesday or Wednesday!  So thank you AGAIN again.  :D	1341182705.0

D: I do have a job, but I just started recently, so I won't get paid for roughly another two weeks. Staying up late hours all weekend cramming for summer classes finals!

t3_vtavd	1341003787.0	kristell93	shroom	[Request] Nashville, TN. Memories of Pies	Well, this time, I'm no longer ridiculously starving (see: my last posting after not eating for 5 days http://redd.it/vpme7 ) after getting paid today. Stayed up til 3am when my check got deposited and walked to mcdonalds, lol. But money is still very, very tight.   Ordering Pizza used to be a very special treat from my childhood that my family shared on special occassions. It used to be, by far, my favorite food of all time. I swear my appetite used to be three times as large when I was three times as young, i'd eat so much pizza. I love having it cut into squares. Middle slices are my favorite.  Anyway, no long story this time. I still haven't had pizza in about a year (can't afford any quality pizza, i'd rather not taint the memory with a cheap version). Papajohns has a 50% off this weekend, and I made a papa account and they gave me some reward points. Would be greatful if someone could remind me of good times tonight when I get off work, or any time this weekend. It'd last 2 days and help my budget quite a bit.   Edit: forgot to mention that I pledge to become an active member of the reddit community ( no brainer here, I spend a lot of time bored on the internet on bus transit ), and of course, if I ever make it out of this situation, to pizza it forward	1341004350.0
t3_vt4ry	1340997754.0	lexhardcastle	pizza	[offer] Pizza and Beer	Alright, so I'm not offering pizza and beer...just pizza. I like the idea of having standing offers for drinks around the country, so here's the deal: Tell me the city and the name of the bar where you're buying me a drink. Whatever city/bar combo I like the best, I'll give you a $15 egift card for pizza. If I'm ever stranded and/or thirsty in your neck of the woods, I fully expect to cash in on this beer. Realistically though? Probably not haha. To satisfy your curiosity: I'm 25, a dude, live in South Carolina, and am bored at work.  Contest ends at 4:45 EST so I can send the gift card out before I get off work at 5.  edit: Heading out early. I'll update and pick the winners when I get home. Contest extended until 5:30 EST.  Edit: This was awesome,  thanks for all the cool offers. I picked two winners and will notify them when I get back (around 6...sorry, hate traffic). I'll definitely do this again, so be on the lookout. It is my dream to be able to go to any city and have a beer and a cool person waiting on me. Thanks!	1341005941.0

t3_vpme7	1340839370.0	kristell93	shroom	[Request] Nashville, TN. No where else to turn	As a preface, I'm pretty long winded. Sorry. (apparently this gets me 3 downvotes :( ) I feel that if someone is going to be generous enough to help me, the least I can do is let them know of my situation.   I don't even know how I found this site.. I haven't used reddit before, though I've heard of it.. I was googling ways to find something to eat and ended up here.   I'm not really sure what to say to motivate someone to help me. I don't really expect anything to come out of this, but I am desperate and don't know where else to turn.  I'm 18, I made the mistake of running away from home at 16 to live with my fiance, who cheated on me within the first week, and left me to my own devices. I was homeless for a while, and did some things I'm not proud of to survive. I'm almost on my feet, and plan to finish college sometime soon.  I haven't eaten or drinken anything in almost 5 days, despite having a full time job in retail. My entire check goes to rent and bus pass, and I usually have a little left over to feed myself and my dearest son (pet dog.. but he's so much more than a pet. He's my everything, he's so precious, and cute, and make's life worth living. An italian greyhound).  I usually stick to the dollar menu at mcdonalds, occasionally a 2 dollar splurge at taco bell. I took a small break from salty noodles for my health. Edit:  I completed my application for food stamps yesterday  But this check, I incurred some overdraft fees due to some bank mix-ups and to-good-to-be-true retailer debit cards. I had to beg the only friend I knew for rent for the week ( did I mention I live in a motel room?). I don't get paid for 2 more days... I just pray that I will be able to make it that long. Already I look bone thin and I feel so drained of energy I can barely move to type this up on my phone (graciously paid for my parents who otherwise have cut all ties). My tongue is parched and I've considered drinking the faucet water...doesn't sound bad but you haven't seen the sink in this room. But all that pales into comparison for the deep sorrow I feel for my dearest canine... his stomach growls practically wake our neighbors at night. I am considering putting him up for adoption, even though I can't live without him, as he is literally all I have.  I'm not trying to prey on your sympathies.. just explaining my situation. I would appreciate..a pizza.. so much. It would feed me for days, and id give the meat to my dog. I haven't had pizza in so long... then I get paid, and begin my cycle anew. I hope to pick up more hours or land this promotion/new job so I can begin a small savings for a new place to live, and finally, back to school.  I'm just incredibly starving. I'll be forever in your debt. Thank you for reading this far... I am sorry it was so long. I hate asking for things but I have to swallow my pride, for my dog.   Edit: I just realized that you all probably think I'm a girl. Sorry if it seems deceptive. I'm a guy. Kristell was my character name from WoW and the first thing I thought of to put as a name. I will try to upload some pics of my dog in a second. If you decide to help me I'll send a link of me and my dog and try to take a pic of my id as well if you want, whatever you need as proof of my situation.  Editx2: I have a verification code as well. Here are a few pics of my dog http://tinypic.com/r/qssd5c/6 http://tinypic.com/r/2s8s2sg/6 He loves sleeping under the covers!  http://tinypic.com/r/2ik46rq/6 	1340896660.0

t3_vnz6l	1340765974.0	elgreco927	dragon	[Offer] Do you work overnights?  I'd like to buy you a pizza. (U.S. only)	**CLOSED**  Thank you for all your posts, I enjoyed reading through them.  I have chosen to give the gift card to **isothien** for regaling us with colorful tales of midnight McDonald's shenanigans.    And a **big thank you** to all the unsung heroes working the midnight shift!   ---------   Last Saturday night, I had a pretty shitty night.  I won't go into details, but at about 5am after a long night and long drive home, I decided to stop at IHOP and drown my sorrows in pancakes and maple syrup.   The lone waitress there was visibly stressed, and looked like she had a hell of a night herself.  I found out later that a table had just dined and ditched on her.    Despite her bad luck, she was very pleasant when talking to me and was really hustling to clear tables and serve her customers.  I've worked at a restaurant before, and could appreciate how tough a job it can be, even without asshole customers.  Anyways, when I left, I walked up to the cash register where she was to pay my bill.  I asked her if she always worked overnights, and she nodded yes.  My bill was only $10.  I pulled out my wallet, and handed her my last $40, and told her to keep the change.  She paused for a few seconds with a look of incredulity, started to tear up a little bit, and then thanked me.  I wanted to brighten her night up a bit, and being able to help someone else improved my mood as well.    I'm not trying to toot my own horn.  I just wanted to tell this story, and in honor of all hard-working 3rd shifters out there, give away a pizza.    So if you work overnights, tell me about it.  What do you do, how did you get the job, do you like working nights, post some pics, etc.  I'll pick someone in the next day or 2 and send a $15 gift card to one of the big 3 chains.    Oh, and if you've ever dined and ditched, go fuck yourself.	1340856526.0

t3_vj4dr	1340559355.0	Fuzzywumpkis	PIF	[Offer] Feeling really down. If you could share some of your joyful, bubbly, and up-beat attitude, I gladly sponsor today's dinner!	UPDATE: The following people have been gifted with e-cards: murphy1210, girlinacoma, and sunnyinphilly69. Thanks to everybody who was kind enough to make a difference in my day. I am very grateful for all the love and kindness which was directed towards me. Oh, and yes, I do feel better. :)  Yup, like the title states: I am feeling down. Totally blasé. Cried literally over spilled milk (well... It was Gatorade) this morning, and now have been sitting for a couple hours in my room staring at my laundry (which wants to get folded, I suppose). I have to go to work in 1 1/2 hours; not much fun either. Being unhappy about my love-life (non-existent), my figure (slightly too squishy), and other trivial shit. I need desperately to get out of this funk!!! So not healthy!!! Now, how you help me is up to you, but be creative? I am up to try anything. Whatever it takes to stop feeling so "blah"... Any ideas? The most effective will get rewarded, maybe the second best, too. :  EDIT: You guys made me already feel better. Still a little bit pouty and such, but at least I don't feel like I am invisible and wasting someone's air for selfish reasons. I liked your ideas very much, and I will try some of them. I promised already 2 pizzas, but eh... whatever... if you keep it coming I am sure I can squeeze 1 or 2 more pies out of my budget. Money doesn't make you happy... Pizza does. :D	1340585710.0

t3_vifbg	1340510025.0	Rollout	Rollout	Be nice or go away......	Not a joke.... I have noticed that we are getting an increasing number of folks that are self proclaimed internet police here. Some of these people even create new accounts for the sole purpose of going to peoples posts to make rude comments.  We do not welcome this. We do not want it here.  We agree that some, although few, people take advantage here, and we aim to curb that as much as possible, but the witch hunts do not help, they hurt the community overall.   So, if you think someone is taking advantage, or you suspect foul play, message the mods. We WILL look into it, and deal with it accordingly.  If you are one of the "vigilantes" you will notice your account(s) will be barred from this subreddit. I will be going through and weeding these people out on a daily basis.  It was nice and peaceful in here, with the occasional asshat... We do not need a bunch of them....   Thank you, and please drive through.	1340512747.0

t3_vdfb1	1340264064.0	geyserguy92	PIF	[Offer] It's bigger on the inside! 	Hey folks, I've been pizza'd once before and held a contest to give away my free Artisan pizza a couple months ago and thought I'd do another little contest for you.  So I recently watched the entire new series of Doctor Who and have fallen in love.  With the show and Karen Gillan.  Tell me what exactly it is that you love about Doctor Who.  What makes you a Whovian?    I can't pinpoint a reason myself.  I just love the show.  I love the Doctor's constant amazement with everything.  He's seen so much and the tiniest speck of life amazes him.  I love his companions.  From Rose all the way to Amy (Amelia).  I love the story, and the way it all falls together.  I love every actor's ability to embody the spirit of the doctor.  I just love it.  Also, my dream is to be the 12th or 13th doctor.  This dream is made infinitely harder by the fact that I'm American and can only do a decent british accent.  [I really think I have the hair for the job, though](http://imgur.com/a/VdS27)  Alternatively!  If you don't watch Doctor Who, you can tell me about a time where things got a little Wibbly-Wobbly Timey-Wimey for you.  Woke up and had no idea what day or year it was?  Lost track of how long you'd been doing something?  If you think it fits the idea of Wibbly-Wobbly Timey-Wimey give it a crack.  Worse that happens is I laugh at you mercilessly from the safety of being behind a computer screen and not in your presence.    One last thing, I don't know exactly how to do this for my oversea's pizza lovers, but if there is a way I will find it.  I am sure if anybody knows JetBoyTerp does and they can help me.  Good luck all.  Anyway, offer is for a $10 gift card!  Have at it Ladies and Gents.  I'll pick the best at 6PM Central Standard time tomorrow!  Edit: Words, man.  Edit 2:  To make it clear, by tomorrow I meant the 22nd of June 2012.  Final Edit:  Forgot to pick one at 6, back to pick one now.  I have chosen Rose_Tyler_Fan as the winner.  Really thank you to everyone who told their stories.  It's been great. 	1340417725.0
t3_vd1er	1340245946.0	oscillatorsss	PIF	[Offer] Returning the favor/in honor of a great ASVAB score.	My very first reddit post was one here a few weeks ago asking for some pizza help. Well, not one but two redditors answered the call - paulinator and PerfectlyFrank27.   So, I'd like to return the favor. Money's not so bad right now. I can only do one tonight, but will do another ASAP. I'm also celebrating the fact that I dominated my ASVAB today making me eligible for basically whatever job I want in the Army National Guard (I know the ASVAB isn't exactly a MENSA induction, but this was a huge goal of mine).  So, let me hear it! Tell me why you need a pizza and I will set you up.  EDIT: I have given the pizza to OpinionatedSouthern. Honestly, I wish I could hook everyone in this thread up. If I had the money, I absolutely would. I will however be doing this again within the next couple weeks, so keep looking out.   Thank you all so much for your well wishes and support. I honestly can't begin to tell how much it means to me. I love this place.	1340250274.0

If anyone remembers me, I am [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/u9426/request_wife_and_i_just_got_back_from_an_awesome/) guy. Basically my wife and I went on an awesome vacation and spent a week in Texas visiting some family and having a great time, feeling recharged and ready to go back to work, only to come home and find out we have both been laid off on the same day. awana56 was kind enough to cheer us up with a pizza as we were both in a foul mood that day.  I was also touched by how many people gave me words of encouragement, telling me to not lose faith and to get out there and kick the job market's ass. So I did just that.  I found a job that is full time and even pays a couple bucks better. It has WAY better benefits - PTO, sick days, a matching 401(k), and so on. This is a great job for me while I plod my way through the mind-numbing, debt-laden clusterfuck that is college. My wife is still looking but she has already had a couple interviews and we are feeling good about the leads she has and our finances are already getting back in order.  I offered to buy awana56 a pizza of his own, but he refused, insisting that I pizza forward. I got my first paycheck and while I can't spend too much on you ($15-$20), I want to give a pizza to someone who is down on their luck right now.   This community moved me with its overwhelming kindness (and tasty pizza). I want to pay it forward and continue to be a part of the awesome RAOP tradition.

Especially since I have received once before, (back in like, november?).   So ya. Got fired from work because I had been really sick and my phone was broken and I had no way to call in...no call no show means no job. Then the next day, I went out of town to my cousin's wedding. Get a call from the bass player in my band flipping out on me for not being there for a gig. Dude doesn't understand that family comes first, and I find myself out of a band. No income left, no income in the forseeable future, and bills piling up.   I hate asking others for help, hate asking for favors, but I'm getting desperate. I don't even have enough change left for some more ramen. Sick of this rut....  Edit:I'd also be willing to do any silly thing in return for the pizza. Photo with delivery dude. Write a poem. Hell, I'll record a nice funky trombone solo if that's what ya want. I can draw pictures orrrrrrr...no idea. Use your imagination.   TLDR: Shit situation. No money. Will be silly for food. 	1339784102.0

Cheesesteaks. On a very regular basis, customers would take several minutes to answer the door, yelling "HOLD ON!!!" open it, huffing and puffing, sweat rolling down their faces and half naked bodies. They were usually about as attractive as you'd imagine chronic cheesesteak takeout-orderers would be.	1339642100.0

t3_ux7h4	1339466928.0	SuperSizedMe	SuperSized	It's Monday, that means Weigh-Ins are due :)	Ehem I'm down 35lbs :) 5 more pounds to go and I'll be giving away another pie :)  ~~If anyone can find any of my old posts in regards to the contest, i'd <3 you forever and probably buy you a pie for saving me a lot of time and trouble :)~~ Thanks to wieners and 69_so_fine for finding these old posts :) When I get paid this friday, i'll see if can come up with 2 $10 pie cards for ya (assume your both stateside?)    First things first, please go ahead and upvote this post so we can keep this near the top to allow everyone to join.   So I've been giving a pie for every 10 pounds lost, and was curious if anyone else was interesting in joining me or even "sponsoring" me. By that I mean 1 of 2 things.    *  You join me in losing weight, every x pounds lost = you donating a pie.    *  You "sponsor" me. **Every 20 pounds I lose** (or you can simply donate a flat amount), you donate X amount of $ at your discretion to be used to give out pizzas.    *  To those asking how often this could be, my currently weight loss is 30lbs, with this past week being a total of 5.8lbs lost. I still have a long ways to go, and you're welcome to give/not give as you wish.    This is simply my way of possibly putting more food into someone else's weight loss. Even if no one is interested, I'll still be donating for every $10 I lose (budget allowing. In other words, might not be the moment I lose the 10 pounds, but will be the next paycheck afterwards)       **How this will work **     * Weigh Ins will begin on Monday, and go until I hit my goal weight (180 pounds)   *  If you are competing with me, PM me how much you wish to lose, how much you will donate, and at what increments.   *  When it is time to donate, simply reply back to this thread, and or PM me so I can add it to the sheet. [You are more than welcome to make an Offer thread,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/sehvs/offer_lost_52_pounds_in_realsupersizeds_weight/) I only ask that you link this thread in your offer post so others may see it and possibly join alone :)  Comments, ideas, etc please leave below :) This contest will run until I hit my goal weight :)    **Possible Sponsors/Contestants:**   1. TrueBlonde (C)   2. Mittimer (S)   3. Tygerlily   4. Edodes (S)  **Confirmed Contestants/Sponsors:**   1.

I was thinking of having one last pizza dinner tonight, before I become a crazed health nut for the next 3 months.    I've never requested a pizza on RAOP before, so I thought this might be an opportune time.  If anyone feels like sending a pie my way, that would be great and much appreciated!  And, as you can see from my history in this sub, it will surely be pizza'd forward.   Thank you! :-)  P.S.

[Canada, Ontario]  There's this take out place in town that serves what other people in town have called the best pizza in town.

The way this works is you must nominate a fellow redditor.  A redditor who you feel deserves a pizza for whatever reason.  Just give me their name and the reason you think they deserve to have it.  They don't have to be involved in this subreddit at all so anyone is good. Also no, you cannot nominate yourself, that is completely not allowed.  Contest ends in the next day or so.  I'm not going to put a specific time on it because I never know when I will or wont be here.  So nominate away :)  Edit: They do need to be in the US since it's a US giftcard so I can't give it to someone internationally  Edit 2: and it looks like Pasta wins!! with honorable mention to interwhos who can't win because they are in Canada :/ Oh well, congrats to Pasta :D	1338317831.0

Say you pick 9...two people pick 3, four people pick 7, and the next highest number picked is 9 and you are the only one who picked it, you win.  You need to **pm me your guess, and post in this thread that you have entered** ...something like "I'm playing" or "I guessed" or "More lighter fluid....now *that's* a fire!"  Anyone who fails to both pm and post here is disqualified. One entry per person please :) Don't post your guess in this thread tho. Any questions, feel free to ask.  This is for a **$30 gift card** to your choice of Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns. **Entries accepted until 6:00pm Eastern** . Winner announced shortly after.  **GOOD LUCK!**  ___________  *Note: If someone outside the US wins, I'll try as hard as I can to get you pizza, but can't guarantee I'll be able to. But I will try :)*  ___________ ___________   ***Thank you for those serving and who have served in the military that protect this country of ours.

t3_u32en	1337881555.0	ShutUpBaby_IKnowIt	pizza-gold	[offer] help me choose a charity, get a $15 gc	Hey Raop'ers,   So today is my birthday, and every year since I've been an "adult," I've taken the amount of "Happy Birthdays" I recieve via Facebook, text message, phone calls, and emails and made them each worth $1.  I then donate that amount (typically around $100) to a cause.  Last year it was "It gets better", the year before-the ASPCA, etc.  Anyways, this year I'm making two donations: one to NAMI, a cause near and dear to my heart, and the other to be chosen by you.    The way you can win this gift card is by providing me a web page link to the charity, upon which I will do my research.  I'm sure there will be a lot of great causes, so please don't think I am disregarding you if you aren't chosen.  I will choose by tomorrow midday.  Thank you!   **Congrats to jenncantdance for suggesting save a life (a organization focused on no-kill shelters).  They have won the gc and the org will be getting $126 in the name of RAOP.  However, I want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for suggesting such great charities and for wishing me a happy birthday.  I hope everyone has an awesome day!**	1337959775.0

There were some generous redditors a few months back who helped me with some pizza when I was going through a hard time financially, and now it is time to pay it forward. So... my offer is small for now, but hopefully down the road I will be able to do this again. I will give out one online gift card of $20 (at least that is the current plan). I can do it to any pizza place that offers such a deal, though I am inclined to do Dominos. Leave me a comment saying why you want the pizza! Simple as that. I will choose later tonight after I get home (at an indeterminate time, EDT). Thanks again to this wonderful community, and sorry it took so long for me to pay it forward. -Fenxor ** edit ** I have decided who to give the pizza too.

If you make a placeholder and haven't written your story within 30 minutes, the story will open up to everyone else.  Timing is important.  Yay timestamps!

Dear kind patrons of Reddit,  As you are probably aware of by now, I am in need of your assistance. I am spending my summer taking classes in college so that I can get ahead on my degree plan, but my funds unexpectedly ran short. As you can probably tell from the title, I have been living off of poptarts and pretzel sticks, which are about to run out. I just need something to last me through the weekend and a nice succulent cheese pizza would definitely do the trick. I am currently studying for an exam tomorrow, so nice pizza would really brighten up my day. Even as I type, I can see flaky deliciousness of the crust, and can practically taste the gooey goodness of the cheese. If one of you can help out in this endeavor, I will be greatly appreciative and I will name my first born child after you (it's funny because you think I'm kidding). Anyways, hopefully at least one of you generous people will deem me worthy enough of this glorious reward. Thank you in advance.  Sincerely, Carpe_Nocturne  Edit: It will be paid forward as soon as the funds are available.	1337201713.0

t3_tq1ds	1337181130.0	thenewloser	pizza-gold	my apologies to those i offered to last night	i feel like such a dick.    vanilla visa wont work on papa johns or domino's websites and my many failed attempts locked up this pre-paid gift card.  all merchants and banking institutions involved with this gift card have told me to wait for 7 days.  at the very least, i was able to successfully get the winner their gift card.  once the card fund are released, or when my new ACTUAL credit card arrives, i will fulfill the second and third offer i posted.  these people won fair and square and id be dick not to keep up with it.  i have those two users e-mail addresses so they can expect to see their gift cards show up sometime in the near future.  once the charges are released, ill order the gift cards to myself and do a $10 drop for #4 and #5.  **tl;dr**; using a gift card to buy gift cards is a really dumb idea.  ~~**edit**; enough talking on the phone, it looks like i got the first and third one pushed through.  confirmations e-mails can be submitted to mods to show follow through, upon request.  seems to just be one i need to catch up on now.~~  **edit:** confirmation all three gift cards went through.  whew!	1337224702.0

t3_tfmyy	1336610292.0	Rollout	Rollout	[Contest] Anyone like trivia? Details inside...	RAOP has a trivia bot, it was getting a lot of use, and now it is slow...  The highest score by the time I wake up on Saturday (May 12th) gets a 25 dollar Dominos e-gift card. I wake up late, as I work night shift. I might do a runner up prize, have not decided on that yet. If anyone wants to pitch in on this that is welcome too.   Don't worry if someone has a big score, they can not play all day... scores add up quickly....   A FEW RULES: No cheating : Meaning no googling of answers. It is not fair to the rest of the people, and it is quite obvious when people are doing it. Some of the mods will be in the channel keeping an eye on this.   Use the same name in the chat as your reddit name.  Now, to join the trivia you simply go to http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#raop-trivia  Put in your username, fill in the captcha, and hit connect... If you have a irc client (such as mirc, or xchat), you can join us on freenode in channel #raop-trivia ...   If you have, or download a irc client you can get an advantage, you can join the same server as the bot, and decrease your lag time. This matters when multiple people are playing.  The bot is always there, and free to use anytime, not just for the contest, but I thought this would be a cool thing to do ....

t3_td6sx	1336497274.0	RorySBarnes	pizza	[Request] I'm kinda sick and tired of Rice and Soy Sauce! -UK	So in September I came to University in Wales, and was greeted with a Debit card, which was the point where I realized "Holy crap I have so much MONEY" at which point I had very little, and due to a few bad decisions in the first few months (such as buying myself a few things for my birthday because not many people did) I'm currently living off of Tesco Value Long Grain Rice and Soy Sauce, with the occasional Rice, Kidney Beans, and Tinned Tomatos with pepper, salt, soy etc. whatever I can find in my cupboard of things! (Honestly, try it, it's actually a badass dish!)  But because of a few bad decisions I made starting uni, I'm currently living off of Rice and Soy Sauce, and since my other housemates are second years, they are actually good with money so they all had Dominos last week, and I've been craving it ever since!  So yes, a random act of pizza would be nice right now, especially after the bullshit I've been through in the past few months with Student Finance fucking me around in terms of tuition fees (and making me fail a class because I wasn't allowed to hand a piece of work in, which means I have to come back in August to do it again when I could be with my family who I miss)  So, right now, a random act of pizza would make me happy. Plus, it's Tuesday, so I'd rather it was today than yesterday or tomorrow, because most pizza places are doing a whole Two for Tuesdays.  I seriously intend on repaying with a random act of pizza in a few weeks when I get my monthly amount of money as I will only need to spend a small amount of that on food since I'll be living with my parents over the summer, so I will definitely be giving a random act of pizza in the near future!  Oh and if it helps, here is a picture of me wearing a hat EDIT: I don't think the hat is helping. :(  EDIT2: For those wondering, unfortunately everywhere near me closes soon, so if you feel like donating pizza then leave a comment and I'll message you about it tomorrow :)  EDIT3: It's a new day, so yeah, that random act of pizza sounds good. :3	True

I can't eat until I get paid on the 15th, I just eat popcorn at work to fill my stomach.  It's really sad but you have to do what you have to do.  (I could make a large pizza last a week for sure).

Surviving off of ramen and mac & cheese is great and all, but sometimes the thought of something better simply overwhelms you.  Pizza can fill my stomach and raise my spirits, and I could certainly use that right now.  I've been fortunate to get help from r_a_o_p before, but I hope you won't hold that against me.  Times are tough and pizza is a wonderful thing.  Also I just realized that I managed to miss my cake day completely.  Damnit.	True

t3_stu1l	1335461034.0	ShutUpBaby_IKnowIt	pizza-gold	[offer] Snail mail and a possible gift card	Hey folks,   So I greatly enjoyed sending out the post cards from Hawaii and now that my schooling is done for a while, I'm super bored during the day.  This offer is for a hand drawn card with a personalized inscription and three of them will include tangible, good-old plastic gift cards to pizza places.  This is for the US only...although I could still send letters to those out of the US.  So what do I need from you?  I need you to be comfortable sending me your address in a PM, I need you to give me an interest of yours that I can draw on the front--this can be tv shows, hobbies, things in general (p.s. I'm not an artist, but I like to try) and I need you to post your pizza place of choice on this forum so that I can get the right card if you are randomly selected.  I should have them done by next weekend and I'll send them along as I finish them! Thanks for reading!	True

One of his favorite things in life is trains (the locomotive kind, get your mind out of the gutter).  I can spare 3 -$20 gift cards to papa johns or pizza hut.  If either of these don't work for you, we might be able to work something else out, and if the winner is international, I'll try and get you some pizza, but I can't guarantee having much luck.  Anyway... ONE (1) gift card goes to someone with the best train drawing.  ONE (1) gift card goes to someone with the best train related story.  ONE (1) gift card goes to the an honorable mention out of either category.  Let's see some cool pictures and hear some interesting train stories. =)  **EDIT: Winners have been chosen!**  * **rose_tyler_fan gets the winning story**  * **jaredcheeda gets the winning artwork**  * **zdigital13 hits it home with the honorable mention!**  **Thank you all for participating and I hope mitch3910 the best as he heads off to Afghanistan.

t3_so8v3	1335194030.0	jennyinstereo	PIF	[REQUEST] Essex Junction, VT - Nearly broke, need to use what I have left to visit dying grandmother in Montreal. Pizza would be lovely tonight :(	Hi, I've never requested this before and I feel a bit ashamed in having to do so, but it would make the world of a difference. I have a good, stable job and always have. I've always been responsible with money and have nearly no debt, except for one credit card which I'm about halfway done paying. This last week has wrecked me financially. My car is a piece of shit and I spent $766 on brake stuff (pads, rotors - I can show proof of this) and now I'm nearly broke.   I have about $70 in my account (I can also show proof of this) and I need it to fill my gas tank (which costs about $40 here in Vermont). My dad called me this morning to tell me that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital last night and she has pancreatic cancer. There's nothing they can do. They can't operate. My dad is not doing well. I'm here in Vermont and my family is in Montreal. I'd like to go to Montreal tomorrow to see my grandmother and be with everyone during this time.   My fridge has hardly anything in it (I can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. It's been a rough Monday so far. A pizza would mean that I'd have a meal for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow, and dinner on the way to Montreal tomorrow. I can also provide a verification code. I only get paid again on Thursday and so I'm looking to see if anyone will help a girl out. Many thanks.  EDIT:  **SteveVStheWorld** has sent me a Pizza Hut gift card. I will post a proper thanks post with photos tonight! I am forever grateful for your generosity.	True

I've posted a couple of times to this subreddit with the same request; a pizza (none received yet). My situation is unchanged, and I've even had to take out a small loan from my bank to keep myself (somewhat) fed for the rest of the month... how I'm going to pay it back, I still don't know.  I'd forever be in your debt if you'd be able to pizza me up; I'm sick of toast, rice, and pasta.  Anyone abroad can order a pizza through [Just-Eat](http://just-eat.dk), which takes every standard credit card available.  As I have previously, I'll promise to send a pizza someone's way when I find my money situation to be stabilised.  Thanks in advance.	True
t3_sn8p4	1335135248.0	DammitChris	PIF	[Request][USA] A pizza for dinner would be wonderful tonight. 	How's everybody doing tonight? I'm not starving, and there is no reason that I *deserve* a pizza more than the next guy, but if you are feeling generous, and happened upon my post, a pizza would feed 4 people at my house for dinner and would be much appreciated. :D. I could also draw you something with my minimal artistic ability while I wait for it to arrive. If you don't 'za me, no hard feelings. Worth a shot. Thanks for looking!      Edit: I'm so used to posting in [/r/gameswap](/r/gameswap) I forgot to put my state in the title. I am located in Kentucky, if that makes things any less difficult.	True
t3_sn2b5	1335126614.0	rdowntime	PIF	[REQUEST] Staggering transition in Tallahassee	I can feel my pride shuffling about uncomfortably but alas I must ignore it. I have recently moved from MD to FL with my 4 year old son. We started strong, got a place rented before we moved and I have a job lined up, passed 2 interviews, background check, drug screening, etc. Now just waiting for my third and final interview before I can begin work. Unfortunately this process has been much slower than I had planned for and my savings is shot. WIC for my son this month has been used up and we are pretty tired of ramen and milk. I remembered seeing this subreddit before and thought I may as well ask right?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.    Edit:  I am throwing in two links to verify that I just moved here.   http://i.imgur.com/Fovmc.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/MyBCq.jpg	True

Pizza would be appreciated, and we'll send you an artsy photo of a building on campus.

Simply answer this question - **what is the one topping you would put on a pizza that you think would be great, but everyone else thinks would be terrible?**  Example - for me, I would put sliced pickles on my pizza; I had it last month from a Boston Pizza in Canada - they were on top of a smoked-meat pizza, yummy.  So let me hear about the one topping you would put on your pizza.  Best answer by noon EDT on Monday Apr 23 will be PM'd for their mailing address.  Then the card will be sent.  I'm only sending one card this time, so impress me with your dream choice of topping.  Good luck to all.  **WE HAVE A WINNER** Congratulations to **_BoogieDown** as the winner of the gift card.  By the way, _BoogieDown prefers to put blueberries on a cheddar pizza.  But I gotta tell you, I am mega-impressed with the over 125 different choices of ingredients!  Cottage cheese, kimchi, blackberries, blue cheese, chorizo, damn...  Once again congratulations and thanks to everyone who participated!	True

t3_sjcc1	1334907999.0	BlackMeddle	FAP	[Offer] Santa Claus here, paying it forward.	So as I said, I get paid today, on a special holiday. That said, I want to make someone's holiday. So excuse me as I get this Santa Claus costume on...  HO HO HO! HAPPY HOLIDAYS! I'm Santa Claus, and welcome to the holiday season, where the greenery is easy to dispose of, the food is so good you want to eat more, and the stocking stuffers you'll actually use all year. In order to make for a better holiday season, one of you will win a gift card to PJ, PH or Dominos!   Only one thing you gotta do: send me your best Christmas-themed photo of today's festivities. It can be a drawing, a real photo, or otherwise. The best one wins.   Contest is over at 2pm Pacific. Best of luck! HO HO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  EDIT: US only. Sorry!  **OKAY, WE HAVE A WINNER!

t3_sj87k	1334900820.0	Better_with_salt	salt	[Contest] US - Funny Costumes or Draw My Fish!	Be creative. I would either like you to post a picture of yourself in funny costume(s), preferably with a way to tell that it is you... or draw your interpretation of my fish, including his tank. Please allow me to tell you a little more about him...  His name is Dexter due to his murderous tendencies. He kills his fishy pals by eating them whole, and has been rewarded with his own private tank to protect the finnocent. I often think he is planning my demise, but that is beside the point. He is a tiger oscar by breed, and he often does an excited wiggly dance when he sees me holding his bag of food pellets (now that I have finally weened him from his taste for blood). Entries must be made by 8PM Pacific time on 4/20.  Edit: Okay, now I'm really torn. I have narrowed it down to Terable and BlazikenTrees. I love the style of Terable's, but BlazikenTree's picture is so close to what my actual set-up looks like that it is uncanny. The only differences are I don't have a crab, and Dexter is on the right... I will decide shortly.  Edit 2: I talked it over with one of my roommates... The winner is BlazikenTrees!!!! We felt that BlazikenTrees' picture best captured Dexter's situation!  Thank you to everyone else who entered. I will have more contests soon!	True

t3_sizfg	1334890359.0	BestRbx	shroom	[REQUEST] Have Friday off From School; Pulling an All-Nighter	Before I give details, I want to apologize for my previous request. I'm desparate for pizza, and bored out of my mind, so I may have possibly made a bogus request looking for pity. Then a friend told me I was an idiot and I should be honest, so I deleted that and made this instead. (Bad first impression is bad. :/ )   So I'm off tomorrow, and the 'rents don't get paid for another week, so we have gatorade, brocolli, and ramen for food, and I'm in a desparate mood for a pizza right now. I'll eat anything, really, so don't worry about giving me the wrong type or size; I'll eat it. I've got $1.90 to my name, so I can't afford water, much less a pizza. xD  In Missouri, USA. PM if you're willing to help a Reddit/Internet-addicted brother out.  And again, sorry 'bout the bogus request a bit back. When I crave, my stomach thinks for me.  Edit; I managed to get a friend to hook me up with something, but thanks anyways guys (not to whoever downvoted me. Thanks fo nothing, >.>).	True

t3_shbac	1334808681.0	czhunc	pizza-gold	[Offer][Contest] Three $15 Gift Cards. Details Inside. 	I've been a part of the RAOP community for a while now, and it's honestly one of the things I look forward to most during my day. I love reading the posts on here, I really enjoy the people here, and of course I love seeing people enjoy their pizza!   Anyways, my new rule is that if I have pizza, someone else will also have pizza. I won't tell you how many times I've had pizza since I made this rule, but you can probably hazard a guess.   I can't think of anything special to hold a contest about right now, so I've decided to let RAOP decide.   1. Contest ends 9PM EST today (4/19)... so in ~~9 hours~~ 18 hours. (Thanks to lilowlpal for noticing the error)  2. Tell RAOP why you want or need pizza. Or tell a joke. Or take a picture of your pet. Whatever you feel like. Brighten somebody's day.   3. I will send the gift cards to the top three most upvoted comments. **Downvotes will not be counted.**  4. Please vote up any and all comments that you enjoyed.   5.

EST, and they will get a $15 e-gift to any of the major three pizza chains (I know it's not a lot -- I am but a poor college student...). I also would love a thank you post whenever you get around to eating the pizza.  Now as for the contest... My favorite contests are the drawing ones, so draw a picture of my dog (pictures below) doing something awesome! Be creative! Winner will be decided based on combo of upvotes (downvoting won't help your cause) and whatever cheers me up the most :D  http://imgur.com/a/AeRLK  **Edit**: You can also draw a corgi instead of my dog, as they are the only type of dog that makes me melt instantly, other than my own  **Edit2:** Thank you so much everyone who commented!

t3_sgipo	1334778187.0	ReverendDS	pizza	[Offer] Some weird rules, see inside.	I've never done an offer thread before (at least not that I remember), I usually just respond to other's requests.  So, here goes...  Rule 1. You must be a redditor for at least six months.  Rule 2. You must be a *contributing* member of reddit (eg: you have posts in other sub-reddits).  Rule 3. You must submit, in this thread, a drawing of a falcon carrying a sword... done with your non-dominant hand.  I have a short attention span, so I'll pick someone within the next hour or two.  Also, as much as I would love to be able to make some family's day, I'm on a fairly limited budget myself, so a single person or couple would probably be better.  **Edited to add:** US only please, I don't understand exchange rates.   **Edited again to add:** Contest is closed. I couldn't decide from the eligible pool, so I'm having my co-workers vote on their favorite (I told them it isn't about which one looks the best, but which one they liked most). I'll be posting the winner and contacting them as soon as I get the votes in.  **Update:** According to 6 of 10 co-workers, http://i.imgur.com/UjhoA.jpg gets a pizza. Congratulations to awana56.  **Update 2:** Just waiting for a response back from awana56. If I don't get one from him/her by 15:30 my time (currently 14:30), I'll choose another from all entries.  **Final Update (I hope):** awana56 has responded and is getting a dinner later tonight. But, I'm also a fan of immediacy, so I randomized all remaining entries to select a secondary winner. Durden87 gets a pizza as well.	True

t3_s8n2o	1334355269.0	Quaquaversal	pizza-gold	[Contest] Movie Dialogue Stories 	**And . . . time! Contest is now closed. Winner is . . . springbroke! Congratulations!** I've sent a PM and hope to hear from you soon. Thank you to every one for participating; I had a lot of fun reading your stories and seeing the different directions they went in.  **Edit: A special Good Neighbour Award goes to elgreco927, who generously gave me helpful advice on how to keep the contest going even though doing so meant his entry would have more competition.** (Besides, have you *seen* how many pizzas he's given away? It's about time he received one himself ;) )  **What the contest was:**  Hello, folks! I am suddenly overcome with the desire to give away a pizza, but only after holding a totally random contest. I love cinema and I love good dialogue. There are so many great lines in so many films, that I think it's possible to build a complete story out of movie quotes. It might be a short and awkward one, but I bet it can be done, and even make sense. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to prove me accurate.    This contest is open to: US redditors who have been with Reddit for a minimum of two months, who have not received more pizzas than they have given, and who are here, reading this post to the bitter end . . . Note: I will be asking the winner for a verification code before I send anything.   The prize is an e-card from an establishment of your choice, so long as it offers e-cards.  It will cover the cost of one of their largest pizzas with as many toppings as they'll allow, a side, and a couple of drinks. Or if you win and you happen to know of a verifiable place that'll deliver to you without asking for the cardholder's ID before they hand over the food, I'll order you all of the above from there. To claim this prize, the winner must provide a verification code within 24 hours of winning, or I will go on to the next person.   It could take some time for anyone to have an entry ready, so I'm leaving the contest open until midnight (PDT, US time) on Thursday, April 19. A pizza e-card, or a delivery, will go out after I have checked out the winner's verification code. I'm aiming for April 20 for prize delivery but it depends on how this goes . . .     The challenge:       Assemble a short story mostly out of memorable movie quotes! Yay!   **The rules**  Each story must:       - contain lines from **at least** three different major blockbuster films. You can use other films, as well, but every quote has to come from ones that are/were successful and well-known in the States (I make an exception for "I reject your reality, and I substitute my own!"; the line is allowed because it is awesome).    - be fictional    - have a plot, complete with a beginning, a middle, and a real ending ("to be continued" and "it was all a dream/hallucination" won't count as endings)                           - make sense    - have characters, who speak only in movie quotes    - be family-friendly. If you need to pull in certain, shall we say, *fraught* lines from Die Hard, for example, go ahead, but please replace the pertinent word(s) with something old-fashioned, like 'dagnabbit', or a blank line.  **You can:**    - Break lines up, put in pauses, have one character start a line and another finish it, change or get rid of punctuation, have people cross-talk, and otherwise play with the words as much as you like; so long as the whole quote is in there eventually, and none of the words appears out of the order they originally showed up in in the movie.   - Use ordinary prose when you need it to hold the narrative together.  **Last rule:**  Every movie quote should be mostly unique to the movie or film franchise it came from ("Come with me if you want to live" is unique; "Good morning" isn't)  **Instant disqualification if:**   -  I can't find the quotes by searching Google or IMDB (this is why they need to come from known movies; the more obscure it is, the harder it will be to check)   - bullying occurs   - you win, but won't/don't provide a verification code                          **Copyright:** Everyone retains all rights to his or her own story or stories.     **How I'll judge**: The pizza will go to the story I enjoyed the most. It doesn't have to be long (this is for pizza, after all, not the Nobel, or an Oscar), but it does have to work.  That's all! Good luck, and thank you for reading!    EDIT: Sorry, folks! I meant to say midnight PDT, not EST, so I've adjusted that in the information above.	True

It might take me a couple of years to do this, but what the hell, let's give it a shot.  [The last pizza I gave away](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/rzpm3/request_pizza_please_chicago_il/) was in my home state of Illinois.  So I'm going to count that as pizza #1.    This offer is for pizza #2.  The next state randomly chosen for this giveaway is **CALIFORNIA**.  **Rules:** You must be able to provide photographic proof that you live or are currently in **CALIFORNIA**.  Maybe it's a picture of you at a famous landmark.  You'll need to incorporate your username and the current date somehow.  If anyone else has other ideas about how to "prove" you're in a particular state, I'm open to suggestions.  I'm sure I'll refine this process as we go along.  **This contest will close tomorrow night, April 14th, at 11pm CDT**.  At that point, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment.  The winner will be awarded a $15 gift card to one of the Big 3 chains.  If this is not an option for them for whatever reasons, we'll work something else out.  OK, let's start this experiment and see how it goes!  ---------------  *Current count:* **2 / 50**  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, **California**, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, [~~Illinois~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/rzpm3/request_pizza_please_chicago_il/), Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming 	True

t3_ruves	1333645785.0	endoflevelbaddy	FAP	[OFFER] Bit of an unusual RAoP, but it involves a challenge and comedy...	Ok, last week I donated a pizza to the person who made me laugh the most.   This week, I want to try something a little different. Since there are lots of generous pizza donators, I guess this may work.  Basically, I want the funniest joke you can muster up. You must make me laugh. BUT, I'm not going to pay the full amount for your pizza, I'll pay half. The challenge is to get another redditor to laugh so much, that they will pay the other half. To make it even more difficult, we must both agree that yours is the funniest joke. And before anyone says I'm being cheap, I have an adequate amount of money to pay full price for a pizza, I just fancy something a little fun with this community.  I want funny jokes. Nothing horrible like rape and dead babies etc. PROTIP: I love anti-jokes, but normal jokes are just as good.  Bear in mind that this might go wrong so please don't hate on me.  [Proof I donated pizza last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ri6sn/offer_my_birthday_is_tomorrow_130hr_time_gmt_and/)  Good luck :D  EDIT: Bear in mind, this may take a while to gain momentum. I'll give it at least, 6 or so hours before the winner will be giving stuff with cheese.  EDIT 2: Guess I was a little ambigious about how someone else will donate with me. If you like a joke and fancy donating, please comment on the joke and maybe PM me? Just makes it a little easier for me to see who is game.  EDIT 3: Come on guys, participate. I'm not doing this for Karma or whatever, I just want to have a laugh and have fun. GIVE ME YOUR JOKES :D  FINAL EDIT: So, my little game worked and me and another donator which goes by the name of of Zombica, have decided that the winner is [this beautifully epic joke](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ruves/offer_bit_of_an_unusual_raop_but_it_involves_a/c48vh57). Thank you all for your submissions. Once again, I had fun reading all your jokes. You guys rock :D	True
t3_rutz9	1333644188.0	A_Mouse_In_Da_House	shroom	[Request][Tacoma, WA] Going to spend the night at a friends house, pizza would make it awesome	Hi RAOP,  So I met a girl last weekend named April.  I like her a lot and she's really fun to hang out with.  We literally chilled at her apartment and watched movies for 60 hours straight.    Well we're both college students, but neither of us really has income we can spend, I have about 100 dollars left that will be used to get me a ride to the airport to fly home, and she has to pay for an apartment by herself while paying for college.  Well tomorrow I'm headed back over and I would love to be able to surprise her with a pizza.  I know, kinda silly, but it's that or we have ham and cheese sandwiches.  I don't mind either way cause I get to hang with her, but one tastes a hell of a lot better than the other.  It's chill if I don't get it, so give it to someone else who "needs" it.  Edit: Note, I am in no way related to balthusdire, who also posted about sandwiches right after me.	True

Those that have treated me and those that have just offered kind words or an upvote. Thank you. Thank you for all the times I may not have said it enough and thank you for making me believe in humanity. Just thank you.  Thank you especially to WorriedGrandma who was kind enough to treat my husband and I to dinner last night and thank you to Pasta for just listening when I felt like no one cared or no one could possibly understand.  I saw the post about people not saying thank you and I have to agree, that's a pretty low thing to do. I think I've always said Thank you, (maybe not through a post, but definitely through PMs) but if I've ever forgotten or just haven't said it enough, I'm saying it now.  Remember Reuben Studdard's: Sorry for 2004? Well change the lyrics around to make this my Thank you for 2012.  I hope everyone has a positive day!  Sincerely: DEStudent  **edit**- **How about we all post a song or unique way to say thank you to each other?!?! I can't offer anything right now, other than a THANK YOU!

t3_rrain	1333467587.0	mcredson	beaker	[Contest] Don't feed the trolls...	Shrapnull won my contest yesterday [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza//comments/rphq5/offer_for_those_who_have_given_before_us_only/). However, being the generous person he is, he requested instead that I fill a request or hold a contest. So here we are, in his honor, I am trying to get rid of a $15 egift card to one of the big three again. It is the opposite of his contest, however. I want to give it away to the nicest person. The user with the best history. Comment to be considered, and say something nice about Shrapnull. User will be chosen by a panel of our IRC enthusiast at 4pm EST.      EDIT: Nominations also accepted and sorry, but US only.      EDIT2: No offense, but want to keep a positive vibe. No sad stories please.

t3_rr47e	1333458623.0	scottydbiz	pizza	[OFFER] CONTEST-US Only "Pizza makes the world go 'round and is scientifically proven to improve your TV watching experience. A pizza scientist told me so..." Guess my fav TV Show, get a pie.	**********CONTEST IS NOW OVER. THANKS TO ALL WHO PARTICIPATED. LET'S DO THIS AGAIN. SOON******    So, Sunday I made a request which went unfulfilled, which is perfectly cool except I made a commitment to RAOP regardless of the outcome of my request.  So, here it is, but there's a catch (There's always a catch, am I rite? Ok, maybe not always, but in this instance, anyway). I am offering a $20 Papa John's gift card to whomever is able to guess my favorite TV show.   You could scroll through my comment history, but I deleted anything that may give it away.  That being said, while these shows are SOME of my favorites, the show is not:  House  Game of Thrones  Boondocks  Futurama  Attack of the Show  Glee  My Pretty Pony: Friendship is Magic  The show is still currently on air and that is the only clue.  STIPS: Winner must have an active account at least one month old. Winner must be verified by RAOP's Verification System located in the sidebar. Anyone PMing me will be immediately disqualified. If no one has guessed correctly, I will choose a comment at random and present the winner with his/her gift card.  Good luck RAOP, and god's speed.  EDIT: An hour in and no correct guesses. Some things to consider:  From replies, one can deduce that the show is still on air, NOT on Comedy Central, and closer to Desperate Housewives than Walking Dead.   HOUR ONE HINT: You probably have not watched a single episode, and if you did you probably wouldn't admit it openly.  GOOD LUCK!!!  **********WE HAVE A WINNER!!!*********************************************************  Congrats to schiffydick for guessing correctly.  The answer was Degrassi. Say what you want and downvote me to hell and back, but fuck me if i don't love some good, ol' fashioned Canadian teen drama.  Enjoy your meal and your month of reddit gold. That was no easy feat.  **********CONTEST OVER WE HAVE A WEINER*********************************************   ***********************CORRECTION**************************************************                                     WE HAVE TWO WINNERS  rwheeler720 had the correct answer three minutes before schiffydick, so YOU BOTH GET A $20 PJ's GIFT CARD AND A MONTH OF REDDIT GOLD. Fair is fair, and since the time stamp on rwheeler720s comment is 3 minutes earlier, he id the official weiner. Still, I told schiffydick he won first, so what am I going to do, not give the dude his spoils? FUCK THE LAW, I WANT TWO WINNERS.  Enjoy and thanks for playing  ************************PAYOUTS CONFIRMED******************************************** 1. I can't maths, but we still have two winrars. 2.

I'm not a bad cook by any means, but I am really bad at coming up with meals to make based on what I have at hand, which is also a little more sparse than I would like.

JonFortress - look for a PM from me shortly. You have 1 hour to respond once I send it.   Have at it RAOP!	True

I log onto reddit, and one of my messages is headlined "You've been banned" from some *ugly people* sub, and was followed with [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/uglypeoplealliance/) link.

I'm also a bit broke with it being the end of the semester. A pizza would make this essay writing far more exciting!  Edit: If any one is interested, my essay is for my artificial intelligence class. The professor likes both the theoretical side and the application side of AI, so he allows us to either code or write essays, or do a little of both.

t3_rmf44	1333206049.0	scottydbiz	pizza	[REQUEST] MI, US. Know what goes well with a House Marathon? I'll give you a guess.	Bad ethernet card means no desktop until Tuesday, so I'm watching one of my favorite shows (commercials and all) on this contraption my parents called a tele-vison. Let's make it a special affair with a RAOP.  A couple of Papa John's one toppings would hit the spot and are reasonably priced (there's a reason I'm subscribed to /r/economics).  In honor of the new season of Game of Thrones (and in honor of my fellow TV nerds), I'm going to make an offer when I get paid on Tuesday, regardless of the outcome of this post. You've earned it, RAOP. Pizza makes the world go 'round and is scientifically proven to improve your TV watching experience. A pizza scientist told me so.  Thanks, RAOPers. You are the moon in my eye.  EDIT: Oxygen just stopped the House marathon. D'oh! Looks like it'll be a Game of Thrones onDemand marathon instead.	True

Each is valid for one free, one night rental from Blockbuster Express. Not valid on Hot List or Blu-Ray titles (although I think I read they may have changed this, and now it takes $1 off your total, it's worth a shot anyhow!). I can give away 2 codes to 5 different people, or more, depending on how many people respond! Hope someone can use them quick! PM me if interested! :)   Maybe somebody who gets a pizza can have a movie to go with their pizza?! I don't have the means to give a pizza now, but this is a start, right?

t3_rlg43	1333139985.0	dolpgrl	shroom	[REQUEST] Houston, TX 77070 Hungry and broke	I lost my job August 1st last year. I receive food stamps but won't get them until Sunday. I have 2 kids and a husband and we would really like to have some pizza tonight so we aren't starving til Sunday. If we were able to get 2 pizza's we'd be able to eat tonight and have some left for tomorrow night. I'd really appreciate it.  Just wanted to add that my 13 year old keeps constantly telling me how hungry she is. If anyone can help soon, please do so. I promise when I am able to get a job I'll pay it forward.  It's 8:06 pm here, and I just wanted to post an update that we are still hungry. More than anything, I just want to feed my kids. Please if someone can help.	True
t3_rldfp	1333136832.0	IGottaSnake	PIF	[Request] Trade? Pizza me today and I pizza you (or someone) next Friday! No food, broke, and have to go to class on empty in 1.5 hours.	Akron, Ohio  Hi,  I will trade, one large cheese pizza for one large any topping pizza to be bought next friday. It can be returned to you or if you want, I will pay it forward here for someone else. I am pretty hungry. In all honesty, I would rather have the $12 to spend on groceries since I could make that last 4-5 days, but beggers can't be choosers and a hot pizza is always pretty damn good. Since it is just me, it would last me a couple days, too. The car broke down and threw everything off this week, so all I have here is some pudding mix but no milk, biscuit mix but no eggs, and stuffing bread cubes but no stock or veggies or an oven.   I leave for class in about an hour and a half, so hopefully it gets noticed and someone is feeling generous here.	True
t3_rlblm	1333134633.0	cvjosh	shroom	[Request] Mom, sick, wants pizza, I only have 5  dollars.

t3_rl9ht	1333132233.0	rosscatherall	shroom	[Received] Thanks to DownSouthDread, this beast mode pizza is on the way.	I thought I'd cram in the pizza before the blind date turned up tonight (she can probably afford pizza any day of the week) so me and the housemate are awaiting delivery on this; http://i.imgur.com/cMcVw.jpg ....  I was looking at rice and tuna until DownSouthDread came to the rescue, so thanks very, very much!  I'll be sure to post pictures up on arrival (of the pizza and the blind date as mentioned in the earlier post)...  Thanks again pizza overlord :)  **Pizza hath arrived!**  http://i.imgur.com/8XWyP.jpg	True
t3_rl0lo	1333121176.0	rosscatherall	shroom	[Request - UK] Oh fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.	Hello!    This is my second request on this site (somebody pulled through for me a fair few months ago in my time of poorness).    I did pay it forward by treating a hooker to a meal the following week.... Long story.    So last night I went out... I don't know how I managed it, but with £15 I got black out drunk. Don't remember anything et al. Judging from a facebook post, I lost my phone at one point so that saved me from most of the embarrassing texts.    I did however manage to secure a date at my house tonight with someone I met at the club. I have no idea what she looks like. I have vomit on the back of the t-shirt I was wearing last night (that had a zipped top on top of it), so I'm not sure whos vomit I had on me or how it got there, it didn't smell too good when I was trying to figure out what it was.    So RAOPers (... Probably a good thing that not many people use this phrase)... I'm not totally out of food and it's my own fault for destroying myself.    But I know that throughout today, more stuff will pop up about last night. A pizza tonight would sure as hell help just a little. I'll keep updating with events that happened last night, someone may as well take some enjoyment out of it.   *Update*  That didn't take long at all for an update.     Apparently I ate a cigarette last night.  I accused the housemate of killing my horse numerous times throughout the night... I don't even own a horse.  Copy of a message I sent last night that I wish I didn't...  Meh though, I'm going to bed right now, good night  Argh Diane, From here on end, you are fjijei  fit  night  goood  night  xx  damnit  Sorry   ish  I'm off to bed   **Edited edit**  And for whoever is responsible for this message; you have been banned from posting to /r/uglypeoplealliance: Ugly People Alliance. ... Brilliant!  **Well. Fuck**  I thought I found all the messages I sent people.. I've just found more.    http://i.imgur.com/GF52o.jpg  And there was another one that I'm not even going to go into, but it sparked a text that I just received off my sister saying *Delete such and such (a couple of her friends) from Facebook* ...   That's me not visiting the family for a little while.  **Edited edited edit**  DownSouthDread pulled through with a hugely generous offer and I'm now sat hugging [this](http://i.imgur.com/8XWyP.jpg) :)  That's a pizza with 7 toppings, bbq crust and double bbq sauce http://i.imgur.com/cMcVw.jpg .... Thanks very, very much DownSouthDread!!   I'll keep up with the updates and pictures throughout the day, from here on, things can only get better, right?  **Final update**    It's pushing on 2am, I do still have 2 slices of pizza left for before I make it to bed, nothing more has surfaced about last night, although I'm guessing that could change once the club puts the photographer pictures up on the site, I vaguely remember chasing the photographer around but I cannot for the life of me remember why.  **Well, shit** .. I thought nothing more could really happen today as it's pushing on quite late, but then I get a picture sent through to my phone... Titled 'Little poo'... A friend decided that his poo was small enough to warrant sending pictures of it sitting in the toilet around. I'll refrain from posting a poo picture up.	True

I have no problem with verification either. Thanks so much!!

IF ANYONE COULD WOULD LIKE TO HELP, ITS ONLY THE 2 OF THEM TONIGHT - AND IT'S THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE HER 2ND TREATMENT.

t3_r7cvs	1332365553.0	DammitChris	PIF	Is it just me, or do people without flair get largely ignored?	I'm not meaning to complain, I've only posted here once. But scrolling through I see a whole lot of requests. And maybe I'm looking at the wrong times, but it seems like the only people that even get comments are the ones that have flair.. I understand the logic behind this, but you can't get flair if you don't get a pizza or send one, right? If I had money I'd love to buy pizza for people, and I'm sure the other people would as well if they were in a better place. Maybe my concerns aren't warranted, it was just something I was thinking about. I love this subreddit and what it does, I just hope people that really need it (Not me, don't think this is a plea or a request) don't get ignored because they had never completed a transaction before.  Edit: I appreciate the thoughtful replies and not burning me at the stake for giving an opinion. I love you guys :D	True

CONTEST IS CLOSED.**    The secret number I randomly selected was **292,703**.    The closest guess without going over was given by **CheshireFrog**, who guessed **289,563**.  She made 4 guesses with 3 clues, and wins a $15 gift card!  It was funny how many 333,333 guesses I saw!  Oh, and a handful of *pi* guesses, 314,159 too.  I almost chose that number too, but decided to go with a random number generator instead.  :-)   Thanks for playing, everyone!  Have a wonderful weekend!  ------------  OK, we've all seen the typical random number contests.  I want to try to put a little spin on it this time.  I'm thinking of a whole number from **1 to 1,000,000**.  Closest guess without going over wins (Price Is Right rules).     **Here are the rules:**   I'll give out 4 clues to help you narrow down what the number is over the course of this week (1 clue per day, Tues, Wed, Thur, and Fri).  A winner will be chosen on March 23rd, Friday night (Central Time).   * If you guess **before any clues are given**, you can have **10 guesses**. * If you guess with **1 clue**, you can have **8 guesses**. * If you guess with **2 clues**, you can have **6 guesses**. * If you guess with **3 clues**, you can have **4 guesses**. * If you guess with **all 4 clues**, you can only have **1 guess**.   So not only do you have to decide what your guesses are, you have to determine if you want to wait for clues at the cost of having fewer guesses.  The clues will get better and better as the week progresses. **If anyone guesses it exactly right, they will win a $100 gift card!**  So if you want to play:  * You must leave a comment below and let me know you are playing. * **SEND ME YOUR GUESSES VIA PM** *(if multiple guesses, put all of your guesses in a single PM)*. For clarity, please include 1 guess per line in the message. * Only 1 set of guesses per account, and your account must be at least 3 months old.   --------------------------  **CLUE #1** *(March 20 @ 8:40am CDT)*: **The number is odd**.  Any new responses must now have **8 guesses**.  **CLUE #2** *(March 21 @ 8:35am CDT)*: **The number is > 200,000**.  Any new responses must now have **6 guesses**.  **CLUE #3** *(March 22 @ 9:40am CDT)*: **The number is < 400,000**.  Any new responses must now have **4 guesses**.  **CLUE #4** *(March 23 @ 5:00am CDT)*: **The number is prime, and sum of the digits is 23**.  Any new responses must now have only **1 guess**.

You have to live in the U.S. (sorry... it's really hard to purchase things overseas because my bank always thinks it's fraudulent). 1.

You must go out of your way to help someone else, and explain in your comment what you did.

t3_r0qrb	1331988572.0	ShutUpBaby_IKnowIt	pizza-gold	[Offer] $20 gift card for person who can guess our score (US)	Hey RAOPers,   This offer is for $20 to one of the big three chains of your choice in the United States.  So today I am playing in a soccer game.  To win the gift card, you need to correctly guess the score of the game (if more than one person guesses correctly, I will go to a random generator).  The rules:  Please place our score first followed by the other teams (i.e. 5 (us) to 2 (them).)  Please only enter once, PLEASE be a redditor for more than a week, and please have not already received a pizza in the past seven days (I'll be reading histories).  A couple possibly helpful facts about the team: *the game is 90 minutes long on a beat-up field in Philadelphia. *I, a girl who is possibly the most in-shape out of the whole team (take that lightly), play defense so I will not be responsible for a single goal. *This is our first real game together  **there were two winners, well technically three because we won 1:0.  The two winners were _Space_Bar_ and Irishb19.  I put them in a random generator and irishb19 won so I will be contacting them via pm.  Thanks y'all for playing!** *You are allowed to predict our team will lose (I'm a realist)  Anyways, good luck and I will have a winner by 4:30 EST!  Happy St. Patrick's day! 	True

I have no cash, a negative bank account balance, and absolutely no food.  My mom sent a check yesterday to help my get by until April 3rd, but it isn't here yet, and I'm really hungry.

RAOP has helped me out once in the past and hopefully today, so I am going to give out 100-200 dollars to this community after I get my return.  This is not some empty promise either!

t3_qy8ir	1331840984.0	DEStudent	PIF	Contest- Help me with Statistics and I'll help you with Pizza	Hi everyone! So this will likely be one of my last posts on here, but I need help and I want to help someone eat. Here's the situation:  I am an adult student and I am in a Statistics class. What's the big deal you ask? I haven't had any type of math classes in almost 12 years and when I did- Guess what?!?! I wasn't doing Statistics! I am horrible at math and I am really struggling here but I need this class to graduate. If you can help me, I will make it worth your while. I will give you a Gift Card to the place of your choice (Pizza Hut, Papa John's or Domino's or even walmart if you trust me) but: This may not happen until Tuesday at the latest. If you trust me, and can prove that you are trust worthy, we can make a deal. I may get the Gift Card sooner, but Tuesday is the latest. I need help with this by Midnight EST **TONIGHT**. Can you help me?  Here's the Assignments:  Chapter 2 in your text provides instructions on how to produce a pie graph, bar graph, and frequency polygon.  For this post, group the 20 data points that you developed in your Week One discussion into 5 groups.  The way that you group the data is up to you. Once you have established your groups, use Excel to graph the data as a pie graph, bar graph, and frequency polygon.  Additionally, follow the directions in Chapter 2 for calculating skew and kurtosis in your data.  Attach the graphs and results to your discussion post.  In your opinion, which of these graphs was most useful in representing your data and why?  What did the results tell you regarding the skew or kurtosis in your population?  Did one of the graphs illustrate the skew or kurtosis better than the others  Second Discussion: Chapter 3 of your text introduces the standard normal distribution. When comparing data from different distributions, what is the benefit of transforming data from these distributions to conform to the standard distribution? What role do z-scores play in this transformation of data from multiple distributions to the standard normal distribution? What is the relationship between z-scores and percentages? In your opinion, does one do a better job of representing the proportion of the area under the standard curve?  **PM ME and I will provide you my data and/or the book we are using.**  This is BIG time. If you can help me, you will be rewarded for your knowledge. If you can't, words of encouragement are also welcome and may earn you a pizza.   **ENDING THIS CONTEST in about half an hour**	True

She's not currently in front of her computer, but I want to give her the option of choosing who she wants to give a pizza to, so this one will be awarded later in the evening.  Thanks to everyone for contributing! :D  **Edit3**: My mom has read everyone's submissions and decided that she would like to buy a pizza for **hello_mellow**.

And posted it, just as I have asked. Thanks for everyone who entered! :)  Ok, so I've noticed lately, that there has been a bunch of requests and saying they will pay it forward when they get money or out of debt. And then a month later, I have yet to see them post anywhere else. hrm   Just had to get that out.   Ok, so here are the contest rules. You must follow ALL of the sidebar rules. So when you are commenting on this, you must do as the sidebar follows. Yes, I will be asking for verification, so please don't PM, unless I PM you first. Sending me a PM, I will automatically block you, so no more pizza's from me. My set of rules are, I need a picture of your "partner in crime" what or whoever that may be. Today's date, your reddit name in "quotes" and a Sentence saying "The ladies of raop reddit are sexy as hell." This must be done in one, 1, uno, hana, picture. I will not take multiple pictures, if you make a mistake, edit and put up a correct picture. Lastly, this is only for people in USA, sorry for anyone living outside of USA.    I will make my announcement on here, and will send the winner(s) a PM. Please, after I announce you on here and PM you, DO NOT, PM me back, saying you are waiting for your pizza, when I'm trying to do my transactions. It's annoying and I will remove you from the contest. I will pick sometime tonight, or tomorrow. However I am feeling in the next hour or so.   So to all who's entering, good luck!	True

First off I want to say thanks to all you fellow Redditors for making this community what it is, and thanks for the last pizza I had received.    I am here today asking for another meal as I am still hurt and unable to work due to a skin infection and the surgery that followed.

Up for grabs are two e gift cards. There is a $25 one for Pizza Hut and a $25 one for Dominos. Contest will end Sunday evening.      Here's how it will work. If you wish to enter simply write "playing" and which chain of the two (can be both) are around you. That way you don't end up with Dominos and the closest one is 500 miles away. The first person that responds to your "playing" post, you will then have to write a story about them and post it to the thread. This story can be a direct relation to their username, posts, etc. Keep it classy though.      Example:   Glinda_da_good_witch: Playing for Pizza Hut   Mcredson replies to her: Write a story about me!   Glinda_da_good_witch replies: [story about mcredson]      **EDIT**: For clarification, anyone can post playing, and anyone can reply to have a story written about them (just as long as you are the first). Don't be greedy, only one story can be written about you. Also, you can both write a story and have one written about you... I think that's it?      **DON'T FORGET**: Even if you are playing you can still have someone write a story about you. Right now we have a back up of people who need to write about someone!      **WINNERS**: Well, damn everyone. Didn't expect this much interest. Great stories all around, was incredibly hard to pick just two. Here are the winners... ChesireFrog won the Pizza Hut gift card and _42_ won the Dominos gift card. Honorable mention goes to Jessiebobessy, who I believe Tug said he would hook up as well! Thanks for the stories everyone!	True

t3_qidwp	1330939499.0	woofiegrrl	FAP	[Request] It's cold and rainy here in Tokyo, I am lonely and tired.	So, this is my first request.  I gave pizza a few months ago, and I had planned to give again; never expected to request because I can afford pizza.  But I got a job in Tokyo and just moved here a few days ago.  It's the most expensive city in the world (according to The Economist) and I can't afford to give anymore.  I thought I might request sometime after getting here.  I'm surprised to find it's so early.  But it's cold, rainy, and dark.  I'm suffering through jet lag, so I'm tired, and I'm getting hungry.  I have some food (mostly cup noodles), but I am longing for a little piece of home.  Namely, Domino's pizza.  The way this would work is that I would give you my login information for the Domino's website, and request a specific order; you can pay by credit card.  My address and everything is all plugged in, and the ordering website is in English.  They have [a "forever alone" special](http://www.dominos.jp/en/shared/img/app/set/btn_lgmcp01_51015_on.jpg) (no really), a 10-inch two topping with a can of soda for the equivalent of US$17.  Yeah, that's expensive...delivery pizza seems to be, here.  I'm happy to do verification and take pictures of pizza.  I am also happy to take other suggestions for returns.  I will *not* let you pick what goes on my pizza, because frankly mayonnaise and corn is not my idea of a taste of home.  I actually kinda want ham and pineapple. :)  It's probably bad timing for this because of the time zone differences, but I'm giving it a shot.  If we can't hook it up tonight, maybe another night?  Thanks RAOP. :)  Edit: Just for fun, [here are pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/meredith) of my life in Tokyo so far!  Still need to upload today's after my calves stop killing me from all the walking!	True

So let’s play a game of 6 Degrees of Wikipedia.  Take me from Europa(the moon of Jupiter) to the Dutch East India Company.    Rules:   -Post the path used in your comment -DO NOT edit your comment once posted.  If you post then find a shorter/better path, create a new comment/reply.  Any posts with an edit asterisk will not qualify. -All links must be part of the main articles.  They cannot be part of references, related topics, disambiguation, or subject/category pages -Do not edit wikipedia to fit your needs.  I will use my discretion here.   -Must have been a redditor for 2 months, no pizza in last month, US only  **-Winners will include:  1. Shortest path(fewest degrees)  2. Most creative path (a path that makes me want to stop and read the article)**    -Contest closes at about 5pm EST Saturday   Not familiar with 6DoW?  Here’s how it works:  Start from the wikipedia page for Europa.  Using the links contained in the main article, jump to another article, then another, then another.  Keep going until you can get to the Dutch East India Company.  This may take some planning, reverse engineering, and trial and error to find a good path.  Have fun!	True

t3_qc9j5	1330567354.0	Fuzzywumpkis	PIF	[Offer] Trying to surprise my boyfriend with something nerdy, geeky, and Reddit-inspired. It's worth a pizza to me if you can make it awesome and a positive memory for both of us!	Alright, I am at work and I just really want to surprise him with something positive and fun. We are a very new couple, but he already does mean a lot to me.  I am stuck at work and a blizzard is raging in our part of the country (MN). Nevertheless, I want to surprise him with something unique. I asked for someone to send him a pizza, and offered one in return. However, should that not work out, any cool idea which bares (bears) fruit will be rewarded. Please make it happen before 11pm? That's when I will fight my way back through snow drifts to his house. :)  EDIT: RastafarianTwit has made my night by sponsoring the pizza. Now it's my turn to reward the best idea. There were many awesome and creative thoughts and recommendations already. If anybody wants to contribute more, go for it.... I think I might just try out the best ideas and keep giving back pizzas (yes, plural) depending on the success. :D   EDIT 2:  Short follow up (pictures): http://imgur.com/a/s4In9	True

Still would like to surprise my boyfriend (who is a Redditor, too) with something unique and nerdy - An anonymous Reddit-inspired pizza, sponsored by you. I'll return the favor tonight for someone else, if you help me out.	My title pretty much sums it up. I would like to send him a pizza sponsored by Reddit. I would love to be ninja like in my attempt to surprise him and his best friend, both of them jamming with their guitars at his home. If you could make this extra nerdy and geeky someway, that would be a HUGE plus! We are a very new couple and just discovered 1 1/2 weeks ago that both of us are Redditors. Despite this blizzard I am stuck at work, and I would rather be with him right now. Anyhow, anybody willing to help out?  EDIT: PastafarianTwit made my night!!!! Pizza is on the way to my boyfriend as we speak. This is so exciting. *doing a happy dance in my office	True

t3_qc5o5	1330562603.0	Ryo_Hazuki	shroom	[Request] Dinner for someone with a bleak future? (Exceedingly long story in comments)	Edit: I'm sorry, I forgot to say I live in Minnesota, USA.  Hey everyone, I'd really enjoy a full stomach tonight, my future is looking extremely down, but I have the next four days to enjoy, I'll share my story, it's a little lengthy, but you certainly deserve to know why I'm asking for a meal tonight.  The sparknotes version is that my Dad passed away when I was young, too young to really remember anything about him other then he loved Star Trek. After that, my Mom remarried a man, who was very abusive. We lived on for about a year and then my Mom passed away. Both of my parents had cancer, I don't know if I do or not, I'm not 100% sure on how the genetics work with something like that.  Anyways, I lived with him for about two years until I moved in with a family from a church. They were in their mid 50's, not at all a good age to raise a 12 year old apparently. They were beyond abrasive to me and just wasn't a good fit, but I had no choice. After about three years I moved up north with a family for about four months when they decided they were too young and busy for me. They were in their late twenties and they had just had two kids, again, not a good fit. I was kicked out on a moments notice had my aunt pick me up and drive me back to the cities. My aunt then proceeded to drop me off at her apartment and tell me that no one in my family is willing to take me in. I waited on the curb with all of my stuff, calling friends, until one of their families wanted to take me in. I lived with them for about two years until they decided they needed to move to Iowa, they offered to take me with, but I declined because a friend in school wanted me to graduate with him. I lived there until I graduated.  About a week after I graduated, they had a death in the family and needed to use my room for company. I could certainly understand, so I moved into a place where a guy owns a house and just rents out rooms, found on craigslist. Being seventeen, I didn't have much of an option because most apartment buildings wouldn't allow me to move in being underage.  I started working at a game store that I loved right near by where I lived, it was a place where I would put in like 40-60 hours a week, sometimes paid for overtime, most of the time not. I loved that store, but a year after I started, the store had to close down due to investor issues. I had about a week's notice and the closing day was the day before Christmas Eve. I was unemployed for a few months until I started working at another game store, but they lasted about four months after I started working there.   Currently, I'm working at a Car Wash while trying to get into something with gaming. I'm not aiming to make it though, I'm in debt to my landlords and I don't make nearly enough money to pay it back currently. I was a bright student, but I've had no opportunity to go to college or anything, I don't have the safety net of a family.  My phone is going to be turned off any minute, I owe Redbox money for a rental that I can't repay (Another stupidly long story), and I owe my landlord $525.00 on Sunday, and I currently have about $4 to my name. I have no where to turn for help, I'm just trying to enjoy the days I have left.  If someone would be willing to make tonight a great night by buying me a meal, I'd be forever grateful.   Thanks for reading, any words of encouragement would be appreciated too.	True

t3_qbgwm	1330533197.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	False Alarm Everybody - I just heard back from a producer who said that this morning they took RAOP off the Calendar for today's Rosie Show.

t3_q7psa	1330319502.0	ismelllaliar	pizza	RAOP, we need to talk about user Bigolenastyfish	This is obviously a throwaway account but I had to get this off my chest.  User Bigolenastyfish is scamming the RAOP community, and just admitted to creating multiple accounts to try and get pizzas.   [The video in which he admits to creating multiple accounts for free pizza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&v=US1Ukat6n7U#t=84s)  Now I usually wouldn't give a shit, but after looking at [his account](http://www.reddit.com/user/Bigolenastyfish), I had to stand up and say something.  He got 2 pizza's from the Papa John's 100 gift code giveaway, and then a $40 Domino's gift card.  I love this community, I've given many pizzas to this community, but after hearing his shitty YouTube commentary about the pizza's he received, but never thanked the kind-hearted givers pisses me off to no end.  He would rather thank God and the fact that he will always provide.  Anyway, it's late and I'm a little drunk, but I just had to get that off my chest.  I know it's RANDOM acts of pizza, as I know someone will be a bitch and post, but still.	True

I've been doing taekwondo for 2 years now and I am at my 10th of 13 color belts. I should have my black belt in December. I'm super stoked and today was a great day. I got to put on my brand new senior brown belt. My mom had a doctor's appointment and my sister had volleyball practice. They weren't able to partake in any celebration. The boyfriend and I would like to celebrate it together with a pizza from reddit. It's not that we can't afford our own. But it's more fun when others are involved. Would you like to be a part of a virtual celebration? :D [senior brown](http://imgur.com/R4bJ4)	True

The goal is for me to pick only one person, but I may do two. for sure no more than two though.  edit: **thread is closed, already picked someone!**	True
t3_q5lc2	1330190152.0	shaynagier	shroom	[OFFER] Hey Reddit, Ready for a TRUELY random giveaway? 2 pizza pies here!	So most of you have seen me around, and boy am I in pizza-debt! (Thank you for all the pizzas, they really have helped so incredibly much... I can't think you enough... though hopefully soon I'll have you all paid up!)  So I got my income tax returns, and now it's pizza-giving time! For my last contest thingy I had you all write superb sentences staring s-worded sentences... and today is just random! You comment, you qualify. Though I will use verification too.  How is this "truly random?" You ask.  Good question!   This is how it's going to work- You comment, you get an entree and I write your name down. Each comment (yes, you can have multiple entries) gets one "entree" to a maximum of 10 entries per person. Also- this is supposed to be a fun thread so if I can tell you are just submitting a bunch of times, all of your entries are disqualified. I will count "Re:" comments, but I won't count replies of yourself to your own comment if that makes sense:       Ex: Person 1: I'd love a pizza please!      person 2: You just got a pizza yesterday!       person 1: but my dog ate it- here's a pic!      person 3: That sucks! Hope you win      person 2: Haha! That's amazing. Sure hope you win!      person 1:Thanks... best of luck to you too!         for the example Person 1, 2, and 3 would each receive 1 entree. If they comment on OTHER people's comments and such, then they would earn a second entree- got it?  So This all starts now and will end at exactly  4:56 central time. At which point I will write your names down in the order that they posted, and group you into groups of 6. Then, I shall roll a die. That number will get crossed off, and written down on a new list, and I will go to the next group of 6.... and I'll repeat this until 1 group of 6 remains. The person that wins that die-roll- gets the pizza!  The OTHER pizza is for one of the poor souls who got kicked out in the first round- hence the writing down on another list who that was. Again, I'll eliminate these down to final 6, and that die roll will win as well. If it's the same person, than I'll roll again and that person will win.  So.. You have about 5 hours give-or-take. Let's chat! Random topic of discussion to start- What is something you should probably get rid of but haven't yet? Why haven't you?   See ya around/at 4:56!   Edit: ok, so I was going to write you guys down as we go.... but I think after it closes tonight I'll just go through, print out the thread, and group by intravals of 5-minutes the best I can. It'll take me a while to do the work, but I'm so freaking excited about this giveaway and I gonnna do it the right!   Edit: ATTENTION REDDIT: Hangovers are avoidable- and not just by not-drinking! When you drink be sure to include a NON-ALCOHOLIC drink and FOOD. The more alcohol- the more food/water. If you do this- then you should not get any hangover at all! It works for me :-)  Edit: Also, I can't believe that I didn't mention this before... but I'd appreciate pics for the lucky two that win!   Closed! Feel free to keep chatting- I've got a few dice to roll one at a time! Be back... later :-)   It's 7:53 here and I'm starting to roll the die... winners soon!    Wow! That took a while! First there was the writing down the entrants - [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/85UJs.jpg)  and can I just say the people who collaboratively "acted" out my sample scenario are AWESOME!  Then I Had to roll the die- introducing your Pizza-giving-dice of 2012: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lRqN5.jpg)  Which started the elimination that ended like this-  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ChCX2.jpg)   Then there was the 2nd pizza loser-gratfication contestants:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/9fimV.jpg)   And 4 hours later you get.....Hmskowronski as the winner at not-being eliminated, and the 2nd-chance for those eliminated first pizza goes to Lolsaniasaurus   Thank you everyone! I had SOOOO much fun with this.. and as I predicted earlier it is now WAY past dinner time and I'm starving. So I've PMed the winners and... that's all for now. Again, thank you. It totally made my day to be #1 on "what's hot" today. 	True

Real life in the working world has taken over my time.  The free time I used to spend reddit'n no longer exists and the time I do have, I am beat and head for the bed these days!       I am here with a special request for my neighbors.  Most of you might remember me posting for them in the past, the Jacksons.  Things are moving along for them, still lots of adjusting to do but, it is being taken day by day.  Diane is doing a lot better overall, the kids are behaving better and Sid is on his way home from rehab.  Granted rehab didn't bring much difference but, he is still alive and they remain a family.       They are struggling right now as you can imagine.  I've made a request for some basic help with food and essentials for them in r/randomkindness.  You can see [that post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/q0d5x/request_help_for_my_neighbors_the_jackson_family/)  This request is to bring a happy surprise for them.  I want to be clear, pizza is not a need and they won't die without it.  I just thought it would be damn nice to order delivery and have a nice family night together.  It would knock Dianes socks off and would be a warm and welcomed delight to her and the kids.    It is too late tonight of course but, there is always tomorrow :)  Can you help me surprise them and bring some pizza partyin' to them!?!?  I of course will pay it forward.  I am unable to do this for them, I am in my own spot with my family right now.  Better days are to come, both of our families are on the right tracks now! :)     **big fat thanks go out to chupanibre25 who in under 15 minutes has been super awesome and pizza'd my neighbors!!!  I love you guys, thanks for being awesome RAoP'ers!!!**	True

t3_pymvb	1329787624.0	zpgjne	pizza-gold	[Question] Has anyone else been getting spammed by Dominos/Cashstar?	I'm hoping I could get some help here. After using the Dominos e-gift card service to send a pizza, I started getting e-mails from dominosegiftcardsupport@cashstar.com.  The e-mail stated that a support case was being opened for me even though I hadn't reported anything. Being the naive person that I am, and thinking that someone at cashstar made a mistake, I clicked on the link to look at my 'support case'.   Now, I'm continuing to receive these e-mails, and my main e-mail is sending out spam e-mails to people that aren't even in my contacts. I tried googling to see if others were having trouble with this and it doesn't seem like that is the case.  I could really use some advice on how to proceed, this has never happened to me before and i'm not sure of the extent of damage that could be caused by this mistake. 	True

Honestly, I don't even know what I'm looking for, but I'm sure you guys/and gals can come up with something.   Contest ends at 10:30.  Oh, and can't be a redditor for two years or more. I just got burned in /r/ loans by a 2 year redditor, so I'm being unnecessarily and misguidedly vindictive. : /  Enjoy.

t3_py2dn	1329762276.0	Stalked_Like_Corn	pizza-gold	Thanks to Raspberryseltzer, Kon-chezz and pastafariantwit! Pizza ordered and enjoyed!	Thank you RAOP and pastafariantwit, Kon-chezz, and overripebanana for pitching in and getting me a $25 gift card and to raspberryseltzer for making a post on my behalf.  For those who don't know (which is probably all of you) i lost my cat last Monday.  I had her almost 16 years and what was overnight I find out she's sick, very sick, and that I had to put her down.  It was so much to take in and the vet visit and the eventual bill of putting her to sleep left me in quite a bind financially and especially emotionally.  I'm still not dealing well with the loss of my faithful companion and today being one week, i'm still struggling.  I decided to use the coupon today and got me some pizza and it's certainly a bell filler and reminds me that there is some good out there.  Thank you Raspberryseltzer for making the post that got it all started.  It takes compassion to say "Hey, this guy needs help" and being proactive about it.  Thank you as well to Kon-chezz and pastafarianTwit for working it all out.  I think Overripebanana was even in on the co-ordinating of it so thanks to you too.  If not, then just thanks for all that you do on this subreddit.  I really appreciate the love that poured out from you guys when i really was feeling as bad as I have ever felt.  It's made things a lot better. I don't know if it's inappropriate but I want to take this opportunity to thank alliterativegenius over at /r/dvdcollection too who sent me some snacks/treats and a $25 dollar gift card to Amazon.  It's great that there are communities here that really look out for others.  I've always felt like family there and we have a small community but it's a great one.  So please, if you can, check it out.  It's for DVD Collecting buffs who like to talk about collecting and show off their collections.  Like we say "It's not the size that matters, it's how many people you show it to".  NOW ON TO THE PICTURES!  [Picture #1 is Chorizo, Mushroom, pepperoni, Deli sized peppernoi, Three Cheese Blend, Two Cheese Parmesan](http://imgur.com/a/FlGsR)  [Picture #3 is Mushroom, Pepperoni, Deli Sized Pepperoni, and Three Cheese Blend](http://i.imgur.com/oapSgh.jpg)	True

t3_pwazn	1329643332.0	RossPeterson	shroom	[THANKS] Thanks to play7up!	I'm going to be honest, when I subscribed, I thought this was going to be the biggest crock of shit board, where I would never be able to get anything, even a discount, whenever I post here, despite following the rules and being polite.   That was until last night when a bunch of the guys and I were playing dungeons and dragons, and a friend of mine actually texted me saying that play7up actually liked my reply to his post enough that I won a free pizza code from him.  play7up, you have FULLY restored my faith in this sub-reddit so much that I love it, and felt that I shouldn't thank you just by a reply, but a whole post. This is my way of singing to the skies, praising you for feeding our dungeon group. Thanks to you, four adventurers were so well-fed, we rescued a ranger party from ogres, and a dragon.   It was a large, extra cheese. My favorite. Thank you X 1,000,000!	True

t3_pvs82	1329607516.0	Absinthe42	shroom	[REQUEST] Pittsburgh, PA: Would like to do something for my boyfriend, but am flat broke for the next two weeks.	Hi, everyone. I'm in college right now and have absolutely no money, and will continue to be broke until I get paid in two weeks. This is my first time posting on RAOP. I'm requesting a pizza not for me, but for my boyfriend. He's absolutely wonderful to me, and right now he's going through a really hard time. His mom is sick. Really sick. And normally in this kind of situation I would make/buy some kind of food for him. Giving food in times of hardship is a kneejerk reaction for me, it's just what I do. But since I can't afford to get him anything at all, I figured I'd give this subreddit a shot. I have no idea what else to do. I'm out of my depth with this. I have no idea what he's going through, so I don't have any idea what to say to make him feel better. But maybe him not having to worry about dinner would help a little bit.  Anyway, thank you for reading this and for your consideration. Sorry I rambled a lot up there.  **EDIT:** Thank you SO FREAKING MUCH, jetboyterp. You are absolutely amazing. I will definitely pay it forward in the future. Thank you!!!!	True

USA only as I have no clue how to order out of country but I will get that figured out also in the future--heard that is also tricky!!

EDIT: Great quotes everyone! Okay I realized picking a letter "off the top of my head" isn't going to work, so instead I'm going to hit random on wikipedia and take the letter that the article starts with. In case of a tie, everyone gets pizza!	True

t3_psrlo	1329423385.0	MonkeyHouse	pizza-gold	[Offer] I did a bad, bad thing...	Earlier today, dont__panic made a post requesting pizza. I, along with a few others, responded with offers of delicious pizza. Someone else was gracious enough to help, and that was that.   Or so I thought! An hour later, a new account under the name dont___panic (do you see that tiny difference?) sent me a PM looking for pizza. Oh you sly devil!   Long story short, dont___panic will soon come to realize that the e-gift card I sent him/her is a fraud. Just as he/she is.   I have only two hopes for this evening:  1. dont___panic makes it to Pizza Hut and orders a pizza before realizing their grave mistake. 2. I may give YOU a $25 Pizza Hut gift card, just because.   [EDIT] I gave away the gift card, thanks for enjoying my naughty deed of the day :0)	True

t3_prqmq	1329361793.0	Scurry	FAP	If someone buys me an oven-baked Domino's sandwich ($7), I will buy them (or pay it forward to someone else) a pizza tomorrow.	The past couple months have been pretty shitty for me financially, but I'm finally getting some dough in my wallet tomorrow morning. My groceries are down to two packs of ramen, which is my dinner tonight (as it has been the past month) unless someone out there would like to satiate my craving for a delicious oven baked sandwich from Domino's. They have a deal where you get a sandwich, bag of chips, and soda for $6.99.   In exchange, I will buy you a large pizza tomorrow when I get paid, or pass it on to someone else if you like (how generous of you!)  Any takers?  Edit: Thank you KimBERLY71! Pictures coming just as soon as it gets here :)  Edit2: They were slammed so it took a while to get here, but good things come to those who wait. [Thanks again, Kim!](http://i.imgur.com/ntcLr.jpg)  (Sandwich deal is only good until 2 pm, unfortunately, but a small pizza is just as good :))	True

t3_pp1dw	1329225074.0	IdTugYourBoat	tugboat	[OFFER]{Valentine’s Day} Cupid’s a bitch, but hunger’s an asshole.	Yeah, it’s *that* time of year again.    The one day out of the year florists and chocolatiers make over 40% of their annual gross income in a single 24-hour period. Unfortunately for the single population out there, this is the one day hand-crafted by fate’s ugly hands to simply remind them of their single status, and once again pierce their hearts with that infernal sword of loneliness. It sucks, I know – I’ve been there. Being single on Valentine’s Day is akin to spending Christmas or New Year’s alone; not fun. But don’t worry, my lonely friends. RAoP is here to help you. This Valentine’s Day won’t suck, at least, not *as* much.  To put it simply, this is a Valentine’s Day giveaway—one of colossal proportions. In fact, it’s so big, we had to stretch it out over the entire day. Ah, “we?” you might ask? Yes. WE–**WE.** As you read on, you’ll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentine’s Day less shitty. Before you continue on to the part where you read the guidelines (which, so help me, you *will* read) on how to acquire your pizza, please take the time to recognize this all-star squad of RAoPers who are taking the time to serve you.  The roster, in no particular order:  [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread), [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack), [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch), [jetboyterp](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp), [badbrownie](http://www.reddit.com/user/badbrownie), [chupanibre25](http://www.reddit.com/user/chupanibre25), [toncinap](http://www.reddit.com/user/toncinap), [overripebanana](http://www.reddit.com/user/overripebanana), [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), [tanyagal2](http://www.reddit.com/user/tanyagal2), [CheeseGamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/CheeseGamer), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [fordandt]( http://www.reddit.com/user/fordandt), [m2mu](http://www.reddit.com/user/m2mu), [kencater](http://www.reddit.com/user/kencater), [MonkeyHouse](http://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeyHouse), [Cacoo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cacoo), [awana56](http://www.reddit.com/user/awana56), [aghos](http://www.reddit.com/user/aghos), [Madamrimbaud](http://www.reddit.com/user/Madamrimbaud), [Supersized](http://www.reddit.com/user/Supersized), [Coasttocoaster](http://www.reddit.com/user/Coasttocoaster), [TokenFemale](http://www.reddit.com/user/TokenFemale), [Drolsonator](http://www.reddit.com/user/Drolsonator)  (Givers, *please* tell me if I missed your name.)  **Guidelines**  So, you want a pizza, yes? Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to **post a pic of yourself with a sign reading “RAOP, will you be my Valentine?”** Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professor’s name, course number—whatever. Get creative; it’s encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (don’t lie, we know you have one). This is *not* a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.  One of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza we’ve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle who’s gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial manner—either a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. **Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.**  **Protip:** If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, you’ll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so I’m actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, we’re employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.   **Couples**  We haven’t forgotten about you; don’t worry, we want to show you some love too. Since there’s two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, *however*, since I don’t want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., **your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other *physical* (operative word here) affection**. Kissing, groping, banging (probably won’t be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you want…*rubs hands together deviously*), whatever—just show us that you’re into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.  As one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool we’ve put together for this event, you’d shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers won’t stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock.   As King Théoden, son of Thengel, said: *“Let them come.”*  Also, we checked the fridge and pantry, and we’re fresh out of fucks—we’re giving out pizza, bitches.  **TL;DR:** Start at the top.  **Special thanks**  I would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people I’ve come across in real life.  My deepest thanks and gratitude to [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack) for coming up with the whole Valentine’s Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guy—he deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadn’t done so, I would’ve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I can’t thank you enough.  I would also like to thank [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread) who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably would’ve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole “how” aspect to this endeavor and I really don’t know how I would’ve figured this thing out without him.  [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch). Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that there’s a fair amount of magic involved.  Last but not least, let’s give it up for our fearless mods, [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [Rollout]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), and [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause. Pasta also deserves our thanks for his efforts in promoting this event and coordinating with mods from other subreddits to get the word out.  **TL;DR2:** No, you have to read this one too.  Edit: Props to snang for putting up the sweet layout.  Edit2: Work now, might try to squeeze one in at lunch. People I'm still waiting on to hear back on, I'll check in from time to time. Other givers, have at it.  Edit3: Just checking in on break, looking good so far. Keep up the good work givers. Also, all you foreveralone folks, after browsing all of your pics, how the hell are *any* of you single? You're all gorgeous!  Edit4: Quick check in on break. Good news for requestors, to be honest, I don't even think we've given away half of what we pooled together. Foreveralone crowd, you should take advantage of this opportunity and browse the other singles, there are some lookers out there. Pizza and internet dating: the best of both worlds!  Edit5: Hey eensy weensy scroll bar, FUCK YOU.	True
t3_pno30	1329153651.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[OFFER] for a Valentine's forever alone	Though this will likely (and justly!) be overshadowed by the totally awesome mega contest, here's my offer: $15 e-card to the big 3 to a forever aloner this V-Day.  I will require proof of said forever alone status (this could be a scan of a divorce document, a screenshot of a Facebook status, a video of your buddy talking about how alone you are, whatever) but ensure it includes your Reddit name.  Also, you must take a picture of said pie once it's received and I will not consider any Redditors who have less than a month of activity or whose history is only asking on "help" threads.  I'm putting this up early so people can gather said proof but this offer will close at 12pm Pacific time on Valentine's Day.  US only.  The winner will likely be chosen by random; however, if there is an especially compelling forever alone story/someone puts in considerable effort to impress me I may reconsider.  G'luck!  EDIT late in the game: if you have received a pie through the mega-contest, please kindly decline your pizza so someone without noms can receive a pie.  Pretty please!    DOUBLE EDIT this hasn't gotten any entries as of late so I'm closing it early.  I've PM'd the winner.  If he/she does not answer soon, I will pick another.  Thanks!  TRIPLE EDIT the e-card has been sent to SgtSloth.  Thanks, all of you, for entering.  I hope you all get fantastic noms from the mega thread or through alternate channels, and happy Valentine's!	True

t3_pn63t	1329115064.0	PastafarianTwit	FSM	Announcing the first Annual RAOP V-Day Giveaway! (Details inside)	So today we're announcing the great [RAoP](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza) Valentine's giveaway.  On Valentine's Day, 2/14, we're planning a massive gift card giveaway.  We know that some redditors are foreveralone, so we'd like to try and brighten up your otherwise depressing Valentine's holiday.  I don't have the exact numbers, but we've definitely got over $1000 lined up for sure.  This is going to be MASSIVE, friends.  **The Details:**  If you are interested in throwing some money into the pot for donations, please PM me (PastafarianTwit) and I can fill you in the details and put you through to the official coordinator, should that be necessary. Keep in mind I'm employed full-time and a full-time grad student, I might be slow to respond, but I WILL respond. Should you wish to sign up for a pizza, we plan on putting up the post for entry on Valentine's morning.  This post is NOT the post to reply to if you want a pizza, this is just to give people ample notification because it's going to be HUGE and we want as many people involved as possible, givers and receivers alike.  Also, I'm hoping that a few more redditors get inspired by what we're doing and decide to pitch in. =)  Unfortunately, this rules out all of you non-US individuals, as these gift cards are US only (sorry, but when you're sending out this many gift cards, you want to make it as easy as possible.)  International people are always welcome on RAoP, however.  These gift cards will be in amounts of $10 for singles and $20 for couples. (If you're a couple requesting $20, we ask that you post a picture of both of you holding a sign with the date and time [Hell, maybe this is a good way to find a Valentine, eh?])  **Testimonials**  "Due to a garbled interstellar space transmission we have a surplus of pizza gift cards. They're absolutely no use to use in the space future! So, we're just giving them away!"  -DownSouthDread (he's high right now)  "Valentine's Day is one of those days where life is either great or crappy.  It's either a reminder of what love you do have, or the love you don't.  After having donated my first few pizzas on RAoP, I realized how much doing one little thing can make such an impact on someone who feels like life isn't going their way.  It wasn't hard to think of a day where more people might feel that way than any other. After seeing all of the other great people on RAoP who donate when they can, I realized that Valentine's Day was the perfect time to get all of the donators together for a huge event the likes of which RAoP hadn't seen."  -RobSpewack  "It's all good"  -chupanibre25  "Valentine's Day is supposed to be a day of love and friendship, but for many it can royally suck.  It's my hope that some of the pizzas I gift today will help ease some of that...well...suckiness!"  -tanyagal2  "pizza is awesome."  -snang  "You don't need a reason to help someone"  -moshimoochi  "Shut up and eat some pizza."  -PastafarianTwit  "To donate makes for a great feeling of peace and having that knowledge you've brightened someone's day up. For Valentine's Day, this is one of the greatest days where one can feel better with a gift, for those who're alone or are couples. This day's also a day of remembering those you love that have passed on. Keep the flame burning, everyone. May the Gods and Goddesses keep you safe on your Path."  -KeiroD  " .............did somebody say pizza?"  -overripebanana	True

I feel so awkward begging for a pizza, but I'm rather desperate...  I fell down the stairs and broke my ankle a little over a week ago.  I just moved in and have virtually nothing in the fridge.  I'm also a broke, currently unemployed college student.  And my savings all went to this new place, and my food stamps application hasn't been approved yet.  My favorite pizza place does online orders, if anyone's willing.  My favorite pizza is a tie between meat lovers or pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese, but if you're on a tight budget too, just a cheese would be awesome.  Thanks for being such an awesome community, and helping so many people!	True

(near King of Prussia, PA) (only USA)	Hi all, So I was one of the lucky ones who got a free pizza on this website, and I both promised and really wanted to return the favor. I just got my hands on some money, and in addition to other stuff that I need to get, I wanted to give someone else a pizza. To do this, I want you to show me some of your best visual work. Make me an excellent design. You'll have more of a chance if you integrate the letter "J", the number "3", and the color blue. I'm a digital media communications major in college with a passion for web and graphic design, so I know a thing or two about great design. I'm going to make this until 11:30 PM EST. If you win, I'll give you a $20 e-gift card to Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's. Good luck!  edit 1: I may make this a little simpler. This may just become a simple "explain to me your situation". I will say though that if you are a college student, you will have a much better chance as I'm a college student myself and I have a heart for fellow college students  edit 2: I am changing the deadline to 10:30 PM EST due to the fact that I changed my offer slightly.  edit 3: I've decided to add a second place prize of $10.  edit 4: If you've won, you will need to send me verification.I will be announcing winners in about 10 minutes.  edit 5: The first place winner is neon_neon! The second place winner is Damascius. Thanks to all who told me your amazing stories and your excellent designs! I really hope that you guys get pizza in some other way on RAoP! I hope and pray that all goes well in your lives!  edit 6: Since I did not hear from neon_neon, the new first place winner is xamblin. I'll be asking for verification.	True

t3_pfczq	1328656097.0	elgreco927	dragon	[OFFER] I'm thinking of a word. Can you guess it?  Winner gets a pie.	OK, here's the gist of this contest.  I'm thinking of a 10 letter English word.  You will reply with a **single comment** with your guess as to what that word is.  As in the Price Is Right, the closest guess without "going over" (alphabetically) will win.    For example, if the word is **pizza**, and the guesses are **pepperoni**, **pineapple**, and **provolone**, then **pineapple** wins.  Winner gets a $15 gift card to 1 of the 3 big US chains.  If the winner is outside of the US, or not near one of those chains, we'll work something out.  **CONTEST IS NOW OVER.**    --------------  **EDIT:** Just to be clear, the "closest without going over" part of the rules relates strictly to alphabetical order.  The length of the word doesn't come into play.  **EDIT #2:** Hopefully [this example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pfczq/offer_im_thinking_of_a_word_can_you_guess_it/c3owy1u) will clear up any questions about the "closest without going over" rule.  **EDIT #3:** Maybe I never should have mentioned that my word is 10 letters long, because it is throwing some people off.  But I'll sweeten the pot and say if anyone happens to guess my word exactly (very unlikely, since the entire English dictionary is in play here), I'll make it a $100 gift card.  It will be like when someone guesses the exact price in on Contestant's Row, and get to reach into Bob Barker's pocket to get the $100 bill.    **EDIT #4:** I thought this would go without explicitly saying, but **ONLY 1 GUESS PER PERSON PLEASE.**  --------------------  **We have a winner!** Alakani wins with a response of "Starvation".  The secret word was **STOCHASTIC**. *Adjective* - Definition: "Randomly determined; having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely."  Thanks for playing, everyone!  	True

But since there's no one around to alleviate my conundrum, aside from my wife and since there are laws against that sort of thing (actually I'm not even worried about the legal aspect of that, I'm more concerned with her retaliation) I'll fill this empty void with my next favorite vice: giving out a pizza.

Hello everyone, I'm stuck behind my sewing machine all day, aside from having to talk to the people I'm sewing for on Skype, but I really don't feel like cooking ramen or mac and cheese. I can send you a pic of me and my vintage green sewing machine named Dinosaur if need be. I was actually banking on the Papa John's offer, but I never got the email and when I went to the link with my email it said I wasn't a rewards member, but I heard I'm not the only one with that problem.  A pizza and a soda from Papa Johns, only place that delivers around me, would be great. Large is preferred, I'm 5 and a half months pregnant so it wouldn't last long. lol Feel free to ask questions, I have a verification code and all.	True

t3_pe3j6	1328583660.0	justaboy	shroom	This [offer] is a little lame, but it's what I can do! Papa John's Pizza + Pepsi Max, all you need is the delivery fee...	So, I remain broke, BUT I registered for Papa Points despite there not being one anywhere near me with the sole hope of finally giving *something* back. I'll pick a winner pretty quick (assuming sufficient response) say 8pm PST (1hr from now?) based on my magical picking skills - if they happen to be around, Jetboyterp, XandaPanda, or IgorCherfal, as people who gave me pizza, have precedence to either claim this pizza, or pick  who receives; but yeah, barring that - 8pm PST, I will send the winner the promo code for free pizza goodness. This doesn't cover delivery fee, I don't think, but that's just a couple bucks.   Tell me why I should give you a pizza!  **tl;dr: Giving away the Papa's promo code because the nearest Papa Johns isn't even in the same country as me (technically true, it's across the border to canada). **  *PS: If for some reason this isn't a valid way to give/can't be made to work, I'll re-offer as soon as I have the couple bucks to pay the delivery fee. *   **GAH! The real world interrupted, I blinked, and it's WAY after 8 (9:10 now =/) But I'm picking someone now!

t3_pbztp	1328463442.0	Ruleroftheblind	shroom	[Request; Westland, MI]  Been living on Ramen and  oatmeal for about a week and I'm running out... 	Lost my job in December.  I've been actively looking for a new one.  Worked as a security guard for a week before getting laid off.  Been going to interviews but still no positions yet.  I've completely run out of money and am basically stuck in my house, saving what little gas I have left for pursuing job prospects.  I've been eating through the last of my ramen during this past week or so and slowly depleting my reserve of oatmeal.  If anyone could send a pepperoni pizza, I'll be sure to keep the pizza-karma flowing once I land on my feet.  I'm also completely open to repaying the pizza favor with some non-money related favor, just let me know what you need.  ***EDIT:*** Pizza just arrived, thanks to clearmoon247!!!!!	True

Unless you just now crawled out from under a rock, the Super Bowl is played tonight.  All you have to do is post in this thread what you guess the **final score** will be, and **which team wins**.    Get both correctly, you win a **$40 gift card** to Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns!  If ten people guess both correctly, those ten people win a $40 gift card each...and my wallet will be severely dented :p  If you guess the correct score, but have the other team winning, you'll win a **$25 gift card**.  Simply getting the winner correctly and not the score, you get a "purple nurple" from Chuck Norris :P  Any questions, ask me.  One entry per person please :) and no editing your post.  If it looks like an edit was done...for any reason... you get nuttin'.   Good luck!  And as a Jets fan, I wish the Giants a prosperous and winning game.  Anybody but the Pats.  Cheers!  **EDIT:  Entries accepted until 6:00pm Eastern.**   **EDIT:  Be sure to enter our mod CayucosKid's Super Bowl contest for tonight as well [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pc5d0/contest_how_many_passing_yards_will_tom_brady/)**  **EDIT:  If no one gets it right, I'll send a $40 gift card to whomever is closest to the final score.**  _______  ***CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED CLOSED***  Cripes, I had absolutely no idea this many people would be entering.  My thought was 30...maybe 40 people.  Better warm up the ol' credit card :P  Good Luck to everyone here and in Cayucos' contest!  Cheers!  ***WINNERS:***  **$40 gift card goes out to slothzen and espacionfinito...both of which got the score and winning team correctly...Awesome job!**    **$25 gift card goes to shaynagier for getting the correct score, but the wrong winning team...It doesn't get too much closer than that!**  If I missed anyone, please let me know as I'm quite buzzed from a lot of Amstel :P  CONGRATS to the winners!  **Gift cards have been ordered** and should be with the winners soon.  Thanks everyone for all the entries, it was far more than I expected.  When I saw over 200 entries I realized I might be sending out a dozen gift cards.  Cheers to all...check back on Fridays for the low-number weekly contest.    	True

t3_p2yn2	1327929814.0	C0nstructer	shroom	[Request] I have an idea..	So I've been seeing a lot of hungry college kids around here, and I must put forth a suggestion. You guys should go to a camp or something. I hear they have lots of free food, like pizza and ice-cream and all manner of other delicious things that you guys like. And camps are in no way dangerous or anything like that. In fact, I myself often take trips to Camp Crystal Lake, to enjoy the sights, participate in some activities with the other campers, like Hide and Go Seek, or Tag. And after we're all done playing, I like to sit down by the camp fire, and enjoy myself some pizza. With all you crazy kids running around, it's awfully hard to acquire some. You could come visit me at Crystal Lake and we could get some together! =D  That said, I would love to get some pizza.  Please?  and thank you. =)  Here is a picture of my hungry self:  http://imgur.com/oZ84t  (New York, USA)  (Also have a verification code)   edit: I even have something I can use to cut the pizza myself!

t3_ozv4x	1327709679.0	MissJacki	PIF	[Request] 3 Redditors, 1 House, 1 Crispy Kitchen.	So, I walk out of the bathroom at about 12am last night to see a cloud of black smoke lingering at the top of our ceiling. Then, as I turned the corner, I saw a healthy orange glow coming from the kitchen. It took me approximately 1.28 seconds to don my magical rainbow cape, mount my Unicorn-Pegasus hybrid Princess Glitterpuff the IV, and charge into battle. Using the power of the Gumdrop Fae, I used the magical fairy dust to douse the flames of hell that were engulfing my stove. (Fairy dust doesn't show up well in pictures, it seems, so it might appear as a "lid" on a pan. So are the rules of the fae.)   After the fires were adequately extinguished, I quickly stashed Princess Glitterpuff the IV and my magic rainbow cape and awoke one of my sleeping reddit roommates. Together we used cookie sheets and just pure will to clear the house of the smoke. Unfortunately, this fire left everything mighty crispy. The inspector said that the stove is completely shot, and, well, [the microwave speaks for itself.](http://imgur.com/a/m6IHc#0) The entire kitchen is going to have to be repainted, as well as part of the living room.  So, now we three students are a bit lacking on ways to produce cooked food. I thought of just setting the stove back on fire, and then cooking over it like an open camp fire during the summer. I was informed this was a poor decision. Princess Glitterpuff IV gave me &#3232;\_&#3232;.   Now, I am beseeching you for help to feed the mighty hunger that roars in our bellies. We would be ever so grateful, and will return the favor when we're not in crippling debt. We have never received a random act of pizza in the past.   Edit: We are in Idaho! YAY.	True

Some of you may have seen me posting around in different subs about my dad in the past month; he had a heart attack the day after Christmas. He finally woke up for a couple of days last week, but then went downhill quickly and passed away this past weekend. As his oldest daughter I was responsible for arranging his services, taking care of his bills/creditors, telling all of his friends, and, now, cleaning out his house -- all this even though I have a new baby, not quite 2 months old. I've spent the past few days working on his house and just don't feel up to cooking tonight... a pizza would be most welcome!  EDIT: Sorry, forgot my location -- SC, USA.	True

t3_oy5pe	1327614030.0	jediwife	FAP	[Request] Tucson, AZ Having a rough couple of days and in the mood for some pizza	Greeting RAoP!  I posted a few days ago, but got an offer really late in the evening and couldn't accept it.  Anyway, I thought I would post a little earlier today and hope it isn't too late this time.  I've been job hunting for about 10 months now, unemployed for 7, and got a rejection call from a job I really wanted the other day. I had a networking meeting yesterday and I am cautiously optimistic as my other "possible opportunities" have fallen through.  Seeing the person that was so easily able to let me go yesterday really rattled me, and I'm trying to get my foot in the door *somewhere*.   Thanks for reading, and I wish you a good evening!  **edit** I'm taking my dog to the dog park so he can play with his canine buddies for a little bit.  I'll be back in about an hour.  Thanks! **edit2** And I am home!  **edit 3**  I got some pizza from the lovely chubawubba- how 'bout giving this redditor some snazzy flair?	True
t3_oy1cm	1327608914.0	EvolDave	pizza	[Request] My fridge is empty and I do not get paid till tomorrow. 	[RECEIVED] Indianapolis IN here. I hope someone can help a brother out.

The look on their faces when eating it was not too pleasant.	True
t3_oxyay	1327605499.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[OFFER] US Only.  It can't be for you.  (Details inside.)	I did this awhile back, and I really liked the result.  So, here's the deal.  You get to nominate someone who is NOT you for a $20 e-card to Papa J's, Pizza Hut, or Domino's.  You must give a good reason for their nomination.  That good reason could be a sob story, that they're really cute, or that you just think they'd like one.  Whatever.  I normally do a random drawing, but I'm thinking democratically, so I'll let the upvotes do my work for me.  Highest=winner.  Fine print:  Redditors with accounts under 3 months are not eligible to nominate or receive.    Redditors who have only posted in "assistance" threads (think: RAOP, Random Kindness, etc.) for assistance but have not given back, contributed to other subreddits, etc. are not eligible to nominate or receive.  (This sound harsh.  It's not: simply, if you're a person whose only Reddit history is asking for stuff, ask in a different thread but not here.)  Redditors who are not willing to post a cute picture of their lovely pie are not eligible to receive.  If the highest upvoted nominee triggers any "sketch" flags, I may demand more information or some such.    I'll close it out at 2pm Pacific Time (5pm Eastern).    **Important Edit!**  Some people prefer to give and NOT receive.  So, I'll need whomever you nominate to either post on the thread, PM me, etc. to confirm they're okay with receiving a pie.  (It also helps me contact them in an expedient manner to get their contact info.)    **moshimoochi gets the card!**  **Last Edit:** Someone has gone through and downvoted several of the posts (not sure why, since the contest is closed).  However, at 2pm Pacific Time, moshimoochi had the highest votes.  You're just going to have to trust me on that one, as I didn't make a screenshot.  	True

So, I've gotten before and I'm under similar circumstances-- although this time the bank my college is making me use (-- look them up if you want a no-questions-asked-pre-approved credit card which is comforting on so many levels you can not imagine) is being mean and holding my money and reporting the ledger balance as the "working" balance and... well they're not one I would've picked by a longshot. Anyway I can't access my money and I'm hungry.  I feel bad just asking for things when *in theory I should have money*, but I still have wire and beads and the offer will go as follows: first person willing to trade gets it. Knowing your ring size beforehand helps (I can't make a ring wirhout it!). This time you get some options, though!  I have Green, Red and White round beads. Read "crystal cut" round beads, Aurora Borealis bicone beads and red bicone beads. Wire is still copper but with an optional wax sealant! (Some people like the tarnished look-- copper is safe to wear regardless). Examples of my work can be seen on my website [here](http://leadpipecollection.net/Atlintis0.php) and some (mostly sketches) can be seen in my shop [here](http://leadpipecollection.net/jewl.php).  You can also request a more masculine or feminine design, or just ask me to pick for you. Ring will most likely be mailed tomorrow or Friday, depending on how quickly someone accepts the offer.

t3_oqshp	1327189392.0	shaynagier	shroom	[Request] No money, flipping upset... I may be dumb but I am hungry, please?	Hey there Reddit... seriosuly, if this doesn't get a reply I swear I'll leave you alone for the next week or so. Basically there's not much food left in the house, so I started conserving what we have...   but yesterday I found out my grandpa died.  Today I find out my grandma- who is only married to him by law and has been seperated from him for over a year now- had him cremated... without really giving anyone the chance to see him. Oh, wait, I'm sorry- family had 30 minutes to get there and an hour to be with him... great considering that he had sisters in Michigan and Texas and my sister is 3 hours away. My father supports my thinking that it was more or less to "get back" at my grandpa. I didn't go see him on principle since those I feel had a right to didn't even have an option.   The one saving grace- I was told that there would be a service of some kind on Tuesday. Well, now that he's in the crematorium, I"m told there will be no service. I am near certain that this is all "pay back" or whatever and I can't BELIEVE my grandma would do this.   As a result I"m VERY upset with her... and I know better because your body speeds up metabolism when you are upset, so I'm not helping my issue of having no food at all...   So if someone could give me some Papa Johns.... Hubby is at work at the moment, but will be home later. And Pizza is really filling so hopefully I can calm down (not like there's anything I can do) and get back to conserving food.  Thanks.   Shayna KCMO	True

Also, there were a couple of you that I would have loved to have picked, but your entry photos sadly lacked the RAoP sign :(   My first pick was just_another_man, because if he's not one of he finest specimens of gorgeousness I don't know what is!  ;) But he's PMd me (without knowing the result) to say he's passing on pizza in favour of a fast food free diet.

t3_op7bl	1327087459.0	shaynagier	shroom	[Request] Pizza Please for Sucky Circumstances (repost/update)	Hey Reddit,  So... some of this was posted 20 hours ago, some of it is new events.... hubby got paycheck. Good news is that rent for February is taken care of. Bad news is that after paying rent, and over-the-limit fees on our checking accounts, we only have 14 dollars to make it until the 3rd of next month.   About the time we got this news we received news that my grandfather killed himself last night. my mother, normally in texas, is in town and I believe that she will be hanging out at our apartment for the majority of the day.    Most of you know that I have asperger's-  because of this, I don't form attachments easilly, so I am OK with my grandfather's passing, though I will miss him to a certain extent. Also due to aperger's I have had issues with my job and had to give it up.  Something that you may not know, unless you stalk me and have read all my other posts on Reddit, is that I am an author. I published my first novella, Stuck in Estrogen's Funhouse in September. However, since I don't have a ton of friends in real life (or really any for that matter), I've had a hard time getting my name (and novella) out there... so to solve this I've devoted a part of my site, shaynagier.com to reviewing books that I read, and offering other lesser-known authors to let me review their books as well. I've got a slow, but still full reading schedule to keep up and I"m a bit behind where I should be. So for the rest of today, tomorrow, and this weekend I will be doing very little else besides reading... well, and dealing with my grandfather's death.  I'd greatly appreciate pizza for me and my family if someone would please be willing to buy it for us.  As I don't get paid for my reviews, I can't exactly use money I make from the reviews to buy the pizza- but I sure would appreciate one none-the-less. I'm hoping to eventually monetize the site itself, but for now it's all working for free.  And, if any other authors would like to be added to my review list, that would be fine too. Please just go to my site and send me an email after reading through my review policy ((don't worry, if you follow it, I'll review your book))  Yup. We are still in Kansas City Mo, and I swear once we have our money situation we're going to give away a pizza every other week if not every week- so it WILL eventually be paid forward. But we plan to do once a month starting soon at least.  Please help.   Edit: Crime Scene dudes say he died of blood loss, after falling. not suicide... which is good... still, he is dead...	True

My heart has been broken and I have decided to leave Reddit land and RAOP  :( I wish it didn't have to come to this but, It has been brought to our attention that someone who shall remain nameless is out in reddit land trashing our reputation. Saying all sorts of mean things about my loyal subjects and how we NEVER EVER give pizzas away and that no one has ever gotten anything from us, well let me set the flickin flackin record straight we always give pizzas away when we have contests. NEVER EVER have we not given them away we may have had to wait a few days to a week or so when our bank was pissy cause we bought to many gift cards at once. But we always give them away. I just wanted to clear the air and let everyone know we aren't trolls or liars at all. And just to prove another point that someone thought Me and Loyal Subject Mom were one person I am going to post our lovely mug shots so you can all see that we are 2 different people, I Da_Queen am the cutest one Mom is just Mom in her glasses and my twin if I were 40 and in College :)    Mom Dad and I have so much fun holding contests and giving away pizzas even my bratty brother loves to read and help us think of new contests to post. My Brother saw me crying and gave me a big hug and said it would be ok, it wont be ok because I am so upset that someone would say such awful things about ME a 14 year pizza giver what did I do to deseve to be called names? This name calling is so childish I wish the person responsible would act like an ADULT and get over it, but alas I doubt that is gonna happen so I will take the high road and leave with my head held high knowing that I did a good thing and that sometimes it can take one bad apple to ruin a basket of apples. with that I bid my farewell you guys are the greatest and I so enjoyed my time here it was fun and I loved all the contests entries I got you guys are so silly and I am glad that I got to spend time here now I am off to the wonderful world of 9th grade :)   http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v340/K_A_M/?action=view&current=us.jpg    Thanks for reading :) now back to your regularly scheduled program of Cheesy Goodness (> (> (> (> (> pizza for everyone 	True

t3_oi5dy	1326650436.0	CompletelyLurker	pizza-gold	[OFFER] A mystery contest of sorts!	Hello people!  I'm in the mood for a little contest, how about you?!  Thing is, I'm not going to tell you my criteria for how I will be choosing the winner.  Once I've chosen, I'll let you all in on the fun.  So go ahead and comment, **ONE COMMENT PER PERSON** (unless you're responding to someone else's comments or to your original comment), and **NO sob stories**.  I don't really care to read them.  You can tell me any other story, though.  Or you can share a picture(s).  Or jokes.  Whatever!  Also, I'd prefer if you weren't using a throwaway.  I'll end this contest on **Tuesday Jan 17 at noon PST**.   *US only, sorry.*  Cast your votes, time's almost up!  Have fun!  **edit:  One of my awesomely brilliant friends gave me the idea of adding a hint a day.  So, here we go!**  *You can comment on your own comment as many times as you want, but it'll only be one entry.  Do this instead of editing, I want to see all of your comments!*  **HINT 1:**  I'm counting...  **HINT 2:**  I'm not counting words...  **HINT 3:**  I'm not counting anything in my personal life. It is Reddit related.  It is a common Reddit "thing".  **HINT 4:**  I suppose I have "help" with the counting, but I'm keeping track of the numbers shown to me.  What numbers, you ask?  It's pretty obvious to me, with a very small twist.  **edit 2:   I see some comments where people have nearly guessed what it is I'm counting.  It's not that complicated...**  **edit 3:  WE HAVE A WINNER!!!  MEECHPEACH!!!**  So, what was I counting?  Well, Reddit Enhancement Suite was actually counting *for* me, but the number I was looking at was *downvotes*.  The person with the most *downvotes* won this contest!  I got a little tired of seeing poor sportsmanship in contests.  People go nuts giving their competitors' comments tons of downvotes.  So, I wanted to be a little different, and show people that the downvoting doesn't really help.  In this case, it hurt!  And there you go!  Be careful of the downvotes in the future, someone might just steal this idea from me!  :)	True

No one has ever posted picture proof receiving from me so that'd be nice too. I'll choose folks this evening, let's say 6 EST.  Edit: Apologies, this is US only. I always forget to include that disclaimer.  **edit2: and done. [ggrundeis got the random](http://i.imgur.com/KoDju.jpg), and justaboy is my other selection. I wish I could help more people but I have to have limits. :)**  **edit3: Seems justaboy actually just got one from someone else, assuming that pans out for him I'll pick someone else. This someone else Ohfaith.**	True

Thanks for playing and all of the birthday wishes! =D**   So, I have $100 total up for grabs, but here's where you guys come in to play.  What I want you all to do is leave a comment telling me whether it should go out in $10, $20, or $25 increments.  The fun in this is the lower the increment, the more winners I have; while a higher increment means the winners get more to eat.    The only thing I want you to do is leave a comment with your vote to be entered.  Whichever increment gets the most votes determines how much goes out and how many winners I have.  Winners will be chosen via random number generator with comments sorted newest first.  Contest will end tomorrow evening when I leave work and finish birthday dinner with my mom, with winners chosen when the votes are tallied and random numbers generated!

t3_obl1t	1326241627.0	wafflecopters	pizza-gold	[Offer] Pizza available for someone in need (x2)	Tell me why you would like a pizza, it's as simple as that!  I will be giving away 2x $15 gift card links, and possibly more.  Sob stories welcome, but not necessarily required to score a pizza!  For every 15 requests made, I will add another $15 gift card.  Entries for the first two will close at 6:30 pm Pacific time (9:30 Eastern).  If there are more than two I will probably give them out between 6:30 and 8:00 PST.  Disclaimer:  -New/non-contributing members need not apply.  New of course is very subjective, as a newer account which has contributed may still be enough. :)  -I may choose to increase the amount of a gift card instead of adding an additional gift card if the requester's need is such.  [Edit] Just to clarify, I will add up to $45 more worth of gift cards from comments. (I need money too after all!)  [Edit 2] up to 15 comments, which means I'm throwing another $15 onto the table!  [Edit 3] we are up to $60, but back down to $45 since I already decided on one of the recipients.  [Edit 4] One recipient has been decided on, and I will be deciding on two more in ~7 minutes (at 6:30 my time).  Due to there being 33 comments so far, I will be giving out $15 more worth of pizza at 7:30, or possible $30 more if this post has 45 comments before that time.  [Edit 5] 3 recipients have been picked, I will be giving out one, possibly two more gift cards in 50 minutes (at 7:30 PST)  [Edit 6] I will be giving out one more $15 gift card in 25 minutes, stay tuned!  [Edit 7] The last recipient has been picked!  I hope all of you enjoy your delicious cheesy nomnoms!	True

No text, words, or explanations.  EDIT: Please post here so everyone can enjoy your stories!  EDIT: The winner of the contest is origami_rock for the epic meat sandwich!

t3_oa1bn	1326154230.0	WishIWereHere	shroom	[Request] (US) I will trade you a lovely homemade scarf, the first one I've ever made or a new one, for delicious pizza. Also I will draw you a narwhal.	EDIT- Fulfilled! Awesomely!  I'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. This is terrifying. Pizza (and maybe a salad, so I don't feel godawful fat. Just a pizza is dandy too) would help calm my nerves. Alas, I have no spare money. So, I am proposing a magnificent trade- I will finish the scarf that I just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. Or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off NOW, because I already have drawings of those. Both are pretty awesome.  [Half-finished scarf](http://i.imgur.com/c1Gax.jpg) (I'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. Right now it's just about exactly two feet. Full disclosure, I did learn to crochet right before I started it, so the beginning isn't great. If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. I can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. Stripes are way better. Anyway. Those are your options. I could totally do a bitchin' Slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black/silver/gray one, or... your options are endless)  [Penguin](http://i.imgur.com/hGWpS.jpg)  [Abrictosaurus](http://i.imgur.com/PDy9R.jpg)	True
t3_o9uqv	1326146070.0	DownSouthDread	pineapple	[Offer(US) & Request(Canada)] RAOP I need a favor. Gift a pizza to my friend in Canada, and I'll gift a pizza here in the States.	Hey RAOP! I have sorta of a strange request.  I need someone to gift a pizza or gift card or just an e-hug to one of my reddit friends.  [My friend](http://www.reddit.com/user/RageAgainstTheRobots) has been having a bit of a rough time lately. Dude was mugged couple month ago, and compiled with just other general life stuff.  I met him a year ago on reddit, although his current account is newer he has always kept me up with me generally kept in touch.  I can vouch for this guy, he's legit.  Now, he surprised me with Reddit Gold today [/shameless plug]. I know dude is saving for his own place and stuff so I know he's going to need every dollar he can save.   RAOP, can you gift my friend a pizza? Since he's in Canada, and I'm a bit on the lazy side today, so I thought I would gift a pizza to someone in the US for this exchange!   TL;DR: Give my friend a pizza in Canada, and I'll gift a pizza here in the United States. International Coordinated Pizza Giveaway!	True

I reserve the right to choose anyone I want for a pizza.       I'm selfish and am doing this because it's one of the few things that makes me feel good.  You must take a picture of yourself with the foodzssssss.    Edit:  I will make the decision around the time I get home.    Donitsu, out.  Edit - 3:09: I messaged someone recently, waiting for them to get back to me.  If they don't get back to me by 3:30 I'll pick another.	True
t3_o8m9y	1326071224.0	nanenj	pizza	[REQUEST] Asking for food! US, AR.	No special circumstances, just feeling lazy and the wife nor I feel like cooking.

The rules are simple, whoever makes me smile the most (can be virtually anything) and is willing to take a picture with their winning zza gets it.   Edit: I feel as if I should clarify the 'down' part of my week.  My uncle died last night and my father was given roughly anywhere from a few days to a week left to live.  I've never had a problem with depression, so I just used the term down.   Winner will be announced at 2:00 EST  Winner: Mightymudkip.  A special shoutout to moshimoochi for being stupendously awesome and getting me that minecraft code I've wanted for so long.	True
t3_o743d	1325970720.0	menmybabies	menmy	[Request] a meal or two please	We've been without a working stove/oven since Christmas.  I posted a request a week and half ago in food pantry, assistance and randomkindness.  My request was for diapers, wipes and food I could make in our microwave.  I included an amazon list which was suggested to me.     I did have an awesome friend here in reddit land purchase an oven machine thing so I could cook real food again.  Unfortunately there was a mishap and she was just refunded for her purchase. This at no fault of her own or mine.     So, we are still without means to cook real food.  I don't have much left that I can throw in the microwave to keep the kids fed.  I'm not worried about me in the least, I could stand to lose weight!!!!!   I hang my head and ask can anyone be of assistance to my family?  Pizza would be nice but, I've also got an amazon list with food on it that costs less and stretches further.  The only down side to the amazon thing is, it will take time for them to ship the items to us...which doesn't necessarily help in the immediate time.   I'm really not sure what I'm asking here.  Pizza and/or amazon food help??  Anything really. 	True
t3_o73y7	1325970524.0	blaurum	shroom	[Request] Or maybe just a rant. Bad 2012, BAD	So I get paid.  Hooray right?  You'd think. I pay my rent, I pay my bills, and then? SUDDEN SHUT OFF NOTICE FROM POWER COMPANY.  Our power was on a medical hold, which ran out. We're waiting for the doctor to send a new form to get it extended again, but she's out of office until Monday.   Apparently, no one felt the need to let us know that the second your hold expires, you are automatically listed for shut off.  Thankfully, it has not happened yet, but they're telling us that it could be at any time (though I guess not on the weekend), because it's "in the field".    Hopefully the doctor form when they send it Monday will be there quick enough to put the medical hold back on our account!   So there's that for sucking.  Also the fact that I paid my rent, but apparently paid late so I owe a late fee. Ha ha.  And somehow DHS found out I was late and called my sister's case manager who called us all "what the hey diddle?"  So that's fun?   Waiting for my food stamps to be renewed, which is taking forever. And my new state medical insurance to be approved.  And to see if I was approved for Emergency Relief.    I am having QUITE a 2012 so far you know?  I could use some cheering up.  At least I'm getting an A in photography class?   Have a photo, check it out:   http://i.imgur.com/1QdfX.png   So what is this teal dear of a post rambling on about? I don't know.  I could use some cheering up.  Words of encouragement or even a pizza donation. But that's not neccesary.   I really wanted to be the one to DO the donating this weekend, not the other way around.  Does that even make sense?  I was so happy about starting out the year not totally in the hole, and now I'm even deeper than I was in 2011 and I don't even have anything to show for it.   Even a virtual hug would be nice.  Edit: I am in Michigan.	True
t3_o69sq	1325904014.0	mintygood	pizza	(offer) Tell me about yourself	Hey all.  I had a super shitty day today at work and ended up gorging on some Five Guys to cheer me up.  Sometimes it just takes something simple (like a yummy meal) to rectify a horrible day.  Unfortunately, though, some people dont have the means and I'd like to try and turn your day around.  Here's the challenge...  First, please no sob stories.  Let's keep it positive and upbeat in the spirit of turning around a bad day.  Ok, if you don't have the money and need a pick me up, tell me about yourself.  Tell me what you do, what you aspire to be, what your hobbies are etc etc.  Kind of corny but I always love hearing people's stories and it, at the very least, will give us all something interesting t read tonight.  I will chose the winner by using random number generator between 1 and X with X being the number of posts (minimum of 10)  Go!  Edit: I'll be extending this giveaway until we get at least 10 posts.  First time giving, still working out the optimal way to conduct a fun and interesting contest.  Don't worry, I'll give a gift card so it won't be time sensitive. Great story guys!!!  Edit 2: the RNG gods have spoken and the winner has been chosen!  Congrats a_haar!  Guys, this was really cool.  Thanks for sharing your stories and I hope you had some fun!  Keep posting your stories if you like, why stop something cool? :)	True

A lot of college students are probably heading back to school and taking leave of the comforts of stocked refrigerators and moms that were happy to see them come home, and are now just as happy to see them leave again! To assist in this not-so-brutal transition, I offer my 21st weekly drawing for a college student.

You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name.

My partner and I are working on some puppets, today - I'm making some dragons. I've gotten pizza once and given pizza once, and I hope it's cool to make a request for some Domino's.

t3_o1y8z	1325645306.0	destinyisntfree	shroom	[Request]  Really depressed in Central Florida, and could use something warm to eat to cheer me up.	Due to an inevitable slowdown in my work field that occurs every December, I have gotten behind on my rent.  My landlord was here today, and as the owner of the trailer park I live in will be going through the parks and reviewing the books tomorrow, he said he will have no choice but to post a 5 day notice on my door, which means I have five days to come up with the rent, or they will file eviction.  Seeing as I do not get paid a full check again until 1/25, this is an impossibility to come up with the money to prevent the eviction.  I have been able to find a place for my husband and my 1 year old to stay, and I can have my 8 year old and 5 year old just stay at their dads, but the friends who are going to let my husband and baby stay with them have said there is not enough room for me as well.  I have a car, and am grateful to have that to sleep in.  Before anyone asks, the reason I am staying in the car and not my husband is that my husband's driver's license expired and we did not have the money to renew it, so he would not legally be able to move the car if there was a need.    Because the lease for the park is in my mohter's name since i bought the trailer off of her and she left it in her name so i could use her security deposit instead of having to pay a new one, i am not able to get any assistance with the rent, as my mother will not go to any of the agencies, and her name being on the lease, it is her who will have to do it.    I am beyond depressed right now.  None of my family can help me, and i am willing to accept my fate, and be glad I at least have the car to keep me out of the wind and cold.  But I have pretty much lost all faith in humanity tonight.  I have gone to several people whom i have helped in the past, friends and family, and none of them are willing to help me at all right now, although some of them are more than able to offer me a couch to sleep on or a hot shower once the inevitable occurs.  They have all just told me they are sorry this is happening and they will say a prayer for me.    i have not been able to eat at all today, and now that I finally have a little bit of an appetite, all of the food i have is frozen and will take several hours to thaw, especially with the cold temperature right now.  I do have food, but just no drive to try and thaw it out and cook it, and to me right now it would be better not to eat, than to have to force myself through the process of cooking a meal.    Some of you know me, as I have been around for a little bit.  I have received pizza once from winning a contest and once from responding to an offer.  My information should be pretty much up to date on the RedditGivers list for those who care to check, with the exception of some barbie dolls and DVDs I received for my kids for Christmas, but i had been sick the last week or so and then dealing with a family crisis, so I have not reported those things yet, nor have i checked to see if the givers have.    If anyone feels kind enough to send a pizza my way, I will fervently agree to pay it forward as soon as I am able.  I just really could use a pick me up.  Sorry this was so long.  Thank you for reading.  **EDIT** I know it is late, and most places are closed, but Papa Johns will take delivery orders until midnight eastern time.  Thanks!	True

Most of the college students are probably still at their folks' home, reveling in the food that they didn't actually have to buy themselves, and alternating between sleeping, eating, and using the remote. But they should be preparing to return to school, where Pizza is one of the basic food groups. To assist in their preparations, I offer my 20th weekly offer to a college student. Your name must be submitted by today (Friday) at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings time), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have heard a Christmas tune at some point in your life.  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ------------------------ **The winner (drawn out of a NEW coffee cup, because I was using the old stained one for tea) was JordanHansen13.

t3_nv2je	1325178317.0	Kentavious	PIF	[OFFER] Pizza.  	I received a few months ago when I really needed it and now can pay it forward (finally).  I'll spend like $20.  I don't know who I will give it to, if you can make me laugh, that's probably a good start.  But understand that I hate most things. Maybe if you're a girl with a pretty smile that would help, but actually I hate when girls get stuff for being pretty so maybe not.  Like that job where you hand out free cigarettes at bars, they always give that job to pretty girls.  But I digress... Not really in the mood to read about broke and starving people.  I know you are or you wouldn't be looking for free pizza.  I'll leave this up for awhile and come back later and choose one of you.  Oh and you have to be willing to post a pic of yourself eating the pizza.  I like that.  EDIT: OK, I'm back. I'll go through and read all the comments and pick someone shortly...  EDIT:  I'm buying a pizza for williamblaze pending his pm.  Thanks all for commenting.  EDIT: Apparently williamblake doesn't want his pizza?  If there's no pm by tomorrow, I'll pick someone new and buy them a pizza.  EDIT: Pizza ordered and scheduled for 7:30pm delivery to williamblake.	True
t3_nuyvp	1325172222.0	C0nstructer	shroom	[Request] Trading a game for pizza.	I have an extra copy of Half-Life 2 on my Steam account that, really, I will never use for anything - and I don't know of anyone who wants/needs it, so I was thinking I could maybe give it to someone on here who could use it, in exchange for a pizza if I am lucky. =D I also have a bunch of those holiday coupons for % off brand games. I have the following:  Half-Life 2  Garshasp: The Monster Slayer  Coupons for:  33% off any one Valve title  50% OFF SEGA Classics Collection (50% off on the title SEGA Classics Collection.)  25% off any one Codemasters title  25% off any one Activision title  25% off any one THQ title  50% OFF Eufloria (50% off on the title Eufloria.)   All of the coupons say:  Excludes titles released after January 2nd, 2012. (Valid January 2nd, 2012 through March 1st, 2012)  But Half-Life 2 is good for whenever. If you want any or all of the above in exchange for some amount of pizza, feel free to say. =D I will give the game to you on Steam before you order the pizza, so kind of putting some trust out here - don't let me down.  And also general location is Oneida, New York. Pizza hut would probably be the easiest, because of the ordering online/gift-card business.  Thank you for your time. ^^	True

Winner announced at 8:00PM CST tomorrow night.**  Since I don't see a lot of offers today, I'm going to offer one. Here it goes: Are you having a bad day? In need of a pizza because you don't have anything but ramen in the pantry? Have someone special that you think deserve a pizza? Need a good meal but can't afford one? Having a party? Etc. Etc. Etc. -  I've given pizza three times and it felt great to offer/give pizza to those in need, so I'm going to be giving another one away today! I'm planning on doing this every week or so, hopefully, I can pull it off.  ###Time &amp; Verification: This offer will be exactly like last time: The offer will be over and the winner will be announced tomorrow night at ~~6:00PM~~ **8:00PM CST**, if not, it will be earlier. The only change is that *you'll need to provide verification if you've won*, for obvious purposes.  ###How It Works: Just comment! Yes, it's that simple. *If you have something interesting, like a picture or a story that would you think might entertain/interest me, by all means, post it with your comment. :)* The winner will be picked by a [random number generator](http://www.random.org), as I will assign everyone a number (that commented). Also, if you have a camera, phone camera, webcam, etc. It would be appreciated as I would like for the person to post pictures of the pizza. Again, anyone can enter, the account just can't be 1-4 days old. If you comment twice, unless it's a reply (which I will not count toward the numbers), you will be disqualified.  --------------------------------------------------- Edit: Sorry for the delay. I've changed the time when I'm announcing the winner because I will not be able to use the random number generator until I get to a computer. I'm about an hour drive away from home and updating this on my iPhone. Hope it isn't too late for some of you guys to order pizza.  **Edit2: After punching the numbers of the total comments (after hiding all child comments), [the winner was 41!](http://i.imgur.com/cQPpk.jpg) I sorted the comments by "old" and counted down, jmgeap, you're getting a pizza tonight! :) For all who didn't win but participated, I will try to do another offer next week or so.**	True

[Read more about the donation drive in this previous post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/npche/offer_9_more_pizzas_to_be_donated_if_we_can_make/)  By all means, if anyone still wants to donate to a very worthy cause (and get in those end-of-the-year tax breaks, please do so at [Team Tera's web site!](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&ct=4&w=5202211&u=TeamTeraUT)  :-)  ---------------  I promised 10 pizzas to RAOP for meeting this goal.  I've already given 4 away ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nkgge/yay_for_elgreco927_and_pizza_thank_you/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/npehz/offer_march_of_babies_fundraising_goal_met_im/)), and so that leaves 6 more.    **3 will go out this week, and the final 3 will go out next week.**  To try and keep things simple, I will be giving away $15 eGift cards to Dominos, Papa Johns, or Pizza Hut (which, I believe, limits this to U.S. Redditors).  In this round, I'd like to see some drawings. There are a few themes to choose from:  * College Football *(a certain team wins extra consideration)* * NFL *(a certain team wins extra consideration)* * Major U.S. Cities *(a certain town wins extra consideration)*  The rules are simple.  Draw something using any of the provided themes and post as a comment in this thread.  At the end of the contest, I'll pick my 3 favorites and award them each a pizza pie.  You can enter as many drawings as you'd like, but only 1 pizza pie per person will be awarded.    These can be artistic, minimalistic, realistic, childish -- whatever you want to make them.

t3_ns3dj	1324973304.0	in2itiveact	pizza-gold	The definitive guide to ordering internationally	There are frequent questions on how to overcome the challenges of ordering a pizza from one country for delivery in another. As an Aussie who has had success arranging deliveries for many other countries I have put together the following guide.  Happy for anyone to ask questions for clarification or for anyone else that had had success to add to the info I have put together :)  Perhaps the mods can link to this in the sidebar if appropriate?   **International Random Acts of Pizza**   *The Aim*  To order pizza from one country for delivery in another.   *The Problem*  The only way to achieve this is to pay via credit card. Online credit card transactions often verify your identity by matching your card number with your name and address. If you don't have an address in the country you are ordering for, things fall apart.  Some of you are probably thinking about the vendors that offer PayPal as a payment method. Unfortunately you can't pay for something that is being delivered to a country other than your own when paying with PayPal, rendering it useless for international pizza giving.   *Things to consider*  The key to beating the system is figuring out exactly what the online pizza vendor in question uses to verify that you are the cardholder. Two things are universal - the cardholder name and the security code on the back of the card. Other than these two, vendors use some or all of the following:  Street address City/Suburb/Town etc Zip or postal code  The first two are easy to work with. The last can be problematic as different countries format their zip/postal codes in different ways. Some have four digits, some have five, some have six, some use letters - crazy!  Other vendors use credit card company specific verification - such as "Verified by VISA" - to verify ownership. Put simply, this would be simpler if everybody used this method as it asks you for information specific to your local bank.  Even if you can get past all these issues there are a few more important things to consider. All vendors, for example, say that they require the cardholder present at the delivery site. In my experience the only vendor that seems to follow through with this requirement is Pizza Hut in the United States. Others don't seem to. Arranging an order for pickup on the other hand has an increased risk that they will ask for the credit card used to pay for the order.  Another and perhaps more important issues is that these days your card issuer will actively try to prevent fraudulent use of your card. You can bet your bottom dollar that if they see one or two pizza transactions in countries other than your own on your card they will suspend it until they speak with you. It may be wise to notify them before you start ordering. My card issuer has been put on notice... Ignore international transactions at pizza stores! :)  Another issue you might face is the language barrier! More on this below.   **Beating the system**  I'm in Australia and have managed to successfully order pizzas for redditors in the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark. Here are some of the challenges I faced and the methods I used to get around them.   *Ordering for the USA*  The two easiest vendors are Dominos and Papa Johns. Though both say they require the cardholder to be present for the delivery, neither have ever done it for one of my deliveries. Dominos simply require a zip code when ordering. If you don't have a five digit code, add a zero to the front of yours to make five, or subtract some digits from the front or back of your cod to make five. This has worked for my 4 digit Australian zip code multiple times.  Papa Johns require a zip code and an address. I use my actual street address but use the town and state for the actual recipient. Again, I modify my own Australian postal code with a zero to make it fit. Again, multiple successes using this method.  Pizza Hut works using the above methods as well, but you have to get lucky to get a delivery driver who won't ask for the card when making the delivery.  Cashstar.com, which powers gift cards for many vendors, will not accept international credit cards period. Bummer.   *Ordering for Canada*  Problem! The online vendors in Canada all accept credit card, but don't transact over the Internet (Canadians, what is with this?) they take payment when they deliver the pizza. Despite this I've managed to arrange orders through some local vendors (not major chains) and Papa Johns by ordering online and then phoning through my credit card details. Unfortunately this means you need to make an international phone call to help out your Canadian friends.   *Ordering for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*  Dominos in the UK are easy, they use Verified by VISA (and presumably the comparable MasterCard system) that finds your actual card issuer based on your number and asks for localised information. You can enter your own geographical info as if you were ordering in your own country.   *Ordering for Germany/Denmark and other non-English speaking countries*  Luckily as far as the credit card transaction thing goes I've never had to enter anything other than the security code on the back of my card when transacting here. The problem has been with the language barrier.  I've managed to successfully deliver pizza thanks to the assistance of Google translate and the recipient guiding me through the order process using screenshots and in some cases even setting up an order and saving it, leaving me to simply add payment information.   *Ordering for Australia*  Being from Australia I can't speak to the challenges of ordering for here from elsewhere. I would love for someone from across the seas to look after an Aussie using the methods from above so we can verify that it works!  Having ordered pizza locally myself via the Dominos online system I'm almost certain that there is no verification against an address or zip/postal code at all. This, in theory, means that anyone should be able to order for Australia.   **Other things to consider**  Unlike gift certificates, paying via a credit card means you will need your recipients address so you can arrange a delivery on their behalf. I usually put the order in my name to avoid the recipient having to give out that information, but obviously their address is a must. I do, however, ask for the phone number of my recipient. This allows me to add it to the order in the event the driver needs to call them if they can't find the place.  If your recipient does give you their name, use it on the order but be sure to use your own name as the billing contact or cardholder.  In some cases you might attempt to arrange a carry out order for your recipient. This can be complicated as it is more likely than not that the vendor will require the credit card that paid for the order for verification. I have, as a result, avoided carry out orders.  In some countries tipping is customary. Papa Johns in the USA allow you to specify your tip when completing the order. Dominos on the other hand require the recipient to add it at the door (in this case I tell my recipient to add a reasonable amount when receiving the pizza). Please don't disregard this aspect when ordering a RAoP.  Good luck!	True

Last night our fridge took a dive and we lost all of our food for Christmas. We have a couple of bags of ramen noodles and a couple of cans of soup but not much else. The Landlord wont come by to look at the fridge till tomorrow. We had a pizza in the freezer to eat tonight but that's gone. With all of our money spent on presents, we don't have any money left over to buy food till the we see my dad tomorrow. Is there anyone that would be able to help a fellow redditor out? It would make the little one very happy :) I can provide pics if needed. Thanks guys  Update: Thank you for the Pizza D_E_Solomon :) I'm walking over to pick it up now :)	True
t3_nripl	1324936833.0	Skull-Leader	shroom	[OFFER] - RETRY - Contest $20. Must be in the United States.	So no one guessed correct last contest so you can check what was submitted and know that none of them are correct.  This is a new contest open to any one with much smaller range.  I have picked a number between 1-1500. I will check this thread in 24hrs for the winner (only 1 guess per person, first guess only). Winner will get a $20 gift card for Pizza that is local to them and delivers. If no one gets it, I will restart contest. You must be a member of Reddit for at least 1 month. PastafarianTwit has the winning answer as well. Good Luck all.  EDIT: well with 1 hour to go still no winner.  Going to have to really narrow this down next time so I can give away some pizza.  EDIT2:  2nd 24 hr contest w/ no winner.  Will restart with "small" range in a few days.	True
t3_nrdi4	1324927546.0	justaboy	shroom	Just found out about this reddit, thought I'd make a request, with offered exchange...	**Post final update** So, as it turns out, Dominos is a kind of awesomely exciting place to do this through, as they have a web app that tracks the pizza through ordering, prep, baking, 'quality control' and delivery. So I now know that my pizza is, at this very moment, enroute...  This will actually be the last update, as next I'll be making the new post with photographic proof of pizzatastic awesomeness (and bacon).   **Final Update: Do to the efforts of the Amazing Xandapanda and the Fantastic Igorcherfas, I am now about to order pizza. In honor of reddit, awesomeness, and deliciousness, there will be Bacon. Photographic evidence will be provided upon reception. I <3 REDDIT SO MUCH RIGHT NOW! =)**  So, I'm broke as hell this holiday season, rough market yadda yadda, I was planning to go to the Food Bank today (luckily where I live really has a great one - not just cans of mystery stuff, but locally grown produce, day old artisan breads, all sorts of great stuff) BUT they're closed for the holiday today. I can go on Wednesday, so it's not big deal, but until then, I have... umm... noodles. Not even ramen, just pasta, with uhh... salt and pepper <.< I won't starve, but the pantry is in bad shape, so when I found out about this reddit, I figured I'd ask. Here's what I offer in return:   First: I am confident that I'll be reemployed soon, and once I am, I will provide pizza, either in direct return for whoever provides me one, or if they prefer, in response to another request.  Second: Trying to think of skills I have that I can offer to do something useful or cool for you - around town I usually offer cooking (Ironic, huh?) but since it's relatively unlikely that you live nearby, and you'd have to provide the ingredients at this point anyhow... Only other thing I can do that is 'unusual' is kinda obsolete via the power of the intarwebs - in addition to English I speak Spanish, French, and German pretty well, and am passable in Italian, Japanese, and Mandarin. So maybe I could translate something for you? Or something? Suffice it to say if you can come up with something that I could do in return despite a lack of resources, I'd be down.  tl;dr: Super broke, food bank is closed, pizza would be awesome. If pizza happens, favor will be returned when I'm capable + ??? now.  Also - this reddit is inherently awesome; whether or not I get lucky here, if I get a decent job, I'll be here to make some contributions, if I get a /good/ job, I'll hopefully make a fair few =)  ,\\//   Live long and prosper, or something ;)   **Edit** Anyone who reads this should totally upvote Bakudai for offering, although sadly Papa John's fails to operate in Bellingham where I live =/  *EditEdit* **The amazing Xandapanda has offered to contribute $9 off of a gift card to a pizza from Domino's if anyone can help with the rest. I just want to make clear that even if no pizza comes of this, the offers and comments (heck, just getting this many Orangereds in one afternoon!) has made major steps towards achieving the stated goal of Restoring Faith in Humanity!**  *editeditedit* The above offer, it should be mentioned that the order, from Dominos, would probably be: They have a deal on where I can get a medium pizza AND some stuffed bread WITH BACON IN IT! for $5.99 ea + tax and delivery charge comes to $16.27; if that seems reasonable... so ~$7 more...   *editediteditedit* **We are very near success! The fantastic igorcherfas has purchased me an additional Dominos gift card, meaning that pending reopened contact with the aforementioned amazing Xandapanda, I will have pizza tonight! (with terrible webcam based photographic evidence!)**  This is officially the coolest thing that has ever happened to me via internet.	True

Oh, right, here's a pretty important part: You have to actually post, either in the comments or via PM, your desire for pizza--and which type (either Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut).  Don't bother sending any type of story, I believe in unconditional pizzas!   4. Hmm, also, in your post, tell me... something! Know a good joke? What about the coolest thing you've done recently? Are you working on anything cool?  Hell, I don't care, just tell me something! If you want to say "I'm tired and I play minecraft all day"--that's good enough for me!   Stealing from the style of some [other people I've seen](http://www.reddit.com/user/BOTW), I'm going to randomly pick people's names out of a trusty coffee cup!   Remember, I'm going to be giving away five of these, so... your odds are pretty good!

What have I done?!!?!?!?](http://i.imgur.com/5PKSp.jpg)". And so rising from their knees they will have to face a [new reality](http://i.imgur.com/LRCxc.jpg).  As a Band-Aid (registered trademark) on this comestible nuclear winter, I make my 19th weekly offer to a college student. Your name must be submitted by today (Friday) at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings time), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have seen a meme picture somewhere, at some time.  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. **You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's**. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ------------------------------------- OK, I pulled two names: one for Domino's and one for Papa Johns.  **The Domino's winner was: bdh008**  **The Papa John's winner was: -Juju-**  I'll be sending them PM's with the certificate info. Merry Christmas everybody!   	True

t3_nn5o5	1324592365.0	SupahNoob	shroom	[REQUEST] Fiscally Disappointed College Student	So I had enough money to finally be able to buy my close friends and family something little for Christmas this year, being that I am in college, you don't get such an opportunity every year to give as much as you want, but this year I found a way to make it work.  However, it's not the Christmas season until you get pick-pocketed at the mall searching for your last present for your mother, eh? I didn't want to leave her out of the holidays, so I decided to put the rest of the money I had in my pockets toward her present. When I woke up this morning, I had a missed call from my card company saying that I had 5 charges that would overdraw my account, and that it was likely someone else had my card (as they spent in the expensive, ritsy part of town -- not my style!).  If you could please help me out for one night of my fiscally disappointing college career, I'd pay it forward after I get through this mess that'll come to with the bank. <3  Happy holidays everyone.    ed// Oh I'm silly, aren't I! I've been a long time lurker and it's my first time actually posting in this Reddit. I've always enjoyed seeing how people help out in this sub.  I'm in Plano, Texas. (North Texas, just outside of the Dallas-Forth Worth area!)	True

For the purpose of scoring, a correct answer is worth **5 points**, an incorrect answer is worth **1 point** THIS IS NOT A TYPO!! AN INCORRECT ANSWER IS STILL WORTH SOMETHING, and no answer is worth **0 points**. And obviously, getting all answers right is an automatic win.   1. The poor guy can't enjoy his damn vacation! **Super Mario Sunshine**  2. You might think this game is Skyrim, then you'll take an arrow to the knee. **Oblivion**  3. This whole game takes place in one night. **Luigi's Mansion**  4. 3 on 3 seizure inducing arcade fighting game. **Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds**  5. I was not aware that Mr. Krab's nemesis could sing. **Electroplankton**  6. This game should've stayed in the 90s. **Duke Nukem Forever**  7. I'll give you a medal if you can actually beat this game!

The bad guy is a bad guy at first, then he's on your side, then turns out to be that he was the bad guy the whole time. **Prototype**  11. Better safe than sorry. **Left 4 Dead**  12. No one sleeps for a thousand years and expects to be alive when they wake up... **Final Fantasy X**  13. Awesome indie game, don't expect to beat it with the good ending on the first playthrough though... Or the second... Or third... Or fourth... **Cave Story**  14. If the bitch had kept her yap shut none of this would've happened in the first place! **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time** (Some of you might argue this but I strongly believe that if Zelda hadn't tried to stop Ganondorf in the first place then Link wouldn't have been suspended in time for 7 years therefore allowing Ganondorf to take over)   15. Doesn't matter what choice you make, you'll always be at a disadvantage in your first match. (Any of them is fine) **Pokemon**  16. Foreigner good. **Resident Evil**  17. Oh, ba-na-na! **Donkey Kong 64**  18. Find every exit possible to beat this game with 100% completion. **Super Mario World**  19. In this series of games not only did the women characters get more boobage, they also got less clothes with each new game. **Soul Calibur series**  20. If you wanna know how this game ends, look at the fucking box. IT'S ON THE FUCKING BOX! **Final Fantasy XIII**  21. Who is Screed? And why are there two butts inside of Screed? **Assassin's Creed (Ass ass in Screed)**  22. The Fruity Tesseract **The Orange Box (A tesseract is a 4 dimensional box)**  23. CHICKEN! **Tekken**  24. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out. **Portal**  25. Why does the robotic man with the robotic eyes need sunglasses? **Deus Ex: Human Revolution**  26. ...And I'm curious to see if you can keep being a douchebag when I stick that gavel... Up your ass! **Saints Row 2**  27. I honestly think that the Peter Gunn theme was very fitting as the soundtrack for this game. **Spy Hunter**  28. The pit of a hundred trials can suck my dick... **Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door**  29. In my opinion, probably the last Kirby game made that's actually worth playing. **Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards**  30. You start playing this game with 3 of your best friends, you end this game with 3 of your worst enemies. (Any of them) **Mario Party**  31. SURE YOU'RE KEN! **Street Fighter**  32. This movie video game SUPPOSEDLY shows you what the actual movie didn't... They went a little overboard though... **The Matrix: Path of Neo**  33. The whole time I thought we were trying to save "Sarah". Who the fuck is Sarah and why are aliens and humans fighting over her??? **Gears of War** (*Sera* is the name of the planet)  34. These space pirates are a lot more fragile than they appear. **Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (But I accepted any Metroid)**  35. I never understood why the map completion in this game went up to 1000% **Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin**  36. "What time is tea time in Wonderland?" **Batman Arkham Asylum**  37. Test your might **Mortal Kombat**  38. Exiting the forest is super simple. **[Super Mario RPG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lni0rfv_CHA)**  39. Frost Insignia **Fire Emblem**  40. She's super hot and you don't even know it! Midna from **Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess**  41. Making fun of old people is easy... But it ain't dignified! **Red Dead Redemption**  42. The page turned, and the little turds grew happier. **Yoshi's Story (Obviously the game doesn't say "turds" but putting Yoshi in the hint would've made it too damn easy)**  43. I think this game was given a name at random... I've played through it one too many times and I don't ever remember going to the past. **Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past**  44. I'm looking for some sailors. **Shenmue**  45. Katon Goukakyuu No Jutsu! **Naruto (Any of them)**  46. He kills you, he copies your power, then he uses it to kill your friends... What a great guy! **Megaman (Guys... It was Megaman... I understand why you might think Kirby, but if it were Kirby I would've said "He EATS you"**  47. Is that a sunflower with big tits? **Conker's Bad Fur Day**  48. People without lives live their dream average life through the life of one of these characters... I don't see the point. **The Sims**  49. Apparently holding active explosives above your head and spinning in a circle makes them more powerful! **Bomberman**  50. My father, videos! My holy father, videos!! (Well there goes your perfect score, none of you will guess this one correctly) **[Super Smash Bros. Brawl](http://z11.invisionfree.com/The_Black_Citadel/ar/t3243.htm)** (There used to be a video attached to these lyrics but it seems that the original poster has removed it. Nonetheless the obscure reference stands and no one, NO ONE got it right... I am disappoint)  EDIT: Changed one of them to make more sense. Still same answer though.  EDIT 2: Clarified a common misconception about the scoring.  **EDIT 3: In the spirit of the games I have decided to extend how long I will accept entries! You guys now have til January 30th to get your entries in! That's one more week than originally stated so get those entries in for a chance to win a $30 gift card to the pizza place of your choice!!**  **EDIT 4: For every 2 consecutive correct answers you get a bonus 5 points. So let's say you get 7 in a row correctly your points would go as follows 5+5+10+10+15+15+20 and so on until you get a wrong answer. This is to make things a little more interesting! And not to worry... EVERYONE'S POINTS HAVE BEEN TALLIED THIS WAY! Also because of this the max score has gone up from 250 to 3250** ______________________________________________________________________________________________ *THE WINNER OF THIS FANTASTIC CONTEST IS DRUMROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL* **TheTuninator!** *With a fantastic score of 279 points! SO COME ON UP AND CLAIM YOUR PRIZE YOU BIG WINNER YOU! xD*	True

t3_niode	1324316137.0	mazack	shroom	[Request] Vancouver WA guy getting back on feet	Been following RAOP for a while for the d'aww of it and upvoting people who need it.  25 y/o here, I've always been independent so this is a little weird for me.  I was laid off from my job of 4 years 3 weeks ago.  After an intense job search, I was hired into an OK paying new job a week later(dancedancedance!) and everything is going fantastic there.  Their pay schedule is harsh (paid in arrears 1 week + 2 week delay = 3 weeks no pay) and I'm not due for a pay check until Friday.  My final paycheck  from my last job went into paying rent/keeping the power on/getting a bus pass etc etc. I'm the frugal type but even with my efficient spending, over the last few weeks I've dropped a lot of weight (down to 5'10" 125lbs). So just putting this out there since I'm darn hungry. Any kindness will be returned in the form of filling a request when I'm back up and running financially.  Vancouver, Washington is right next to Portland, Oregon. ... Northwest USA.  Thank you all for reading and for being there.  Happy Holidays to everyone!	True

t3_ni39o	1324268138.0	tenehemia	shroom	[Request] Didn't get the job - again	It seems like it's the same thing every time.  I submit an application.  I know a guy.  I'm feeling good.  I call in and - of course - "the position has been filled".  In a world of lazy people who just want to get rich quick, I'm stuck with my willingness to work and no opportunity to do so.  Ironically, the job I just got turned down for would have been answering the phones at the pizza place.  I have a college education and I can't get a job answering the pizza phone.    I'm not just distraught, I'm hungry.  This most recent rejection is just one on top of years of similar rejections and concurrent years of poverty.  I'm feeling pretty awful, RAOP.  You've been good to me before, and I could really use a pick-me-up.  Edit: In my morose state, I forgot to mention that I'm in Minneapolis, MN, US.	True

Kept meaning to post on offer on here, and I figured I might as well make it a little bit more fun.   OFFER: 15$ e-gift card to place of your choosing.  RESTRICTIONS: redditor for 1 month or more, have posted or commented in subreddits other than this one and the other Random act ones.  CONTEST: I'm looking for something-anything at all, a picture, song, story- that would make me smile, laugh, cry, or increase my faith in humanity (particularly the last).   DEADLINE: Feel free to submit until the day after tomorrow, 12/20, around 3 PM- I'll try to get the card out in time for dinner in case you need it. ~~I will extend this deadline to Friday if there are fewer than 5 submissions~~  EXTRA: Send me absolutely anything you want, from a picture you've taken to a joke you found in the bowels of the internet. I shall use a complicated scientific formula involving spaghetti and ants to pick the winner (not really).  Have fun! :D	True
t3_nhtdi	1324253252.0	Lucavious	PIF	[OFFER] Make somebody's day on the internet!	This is a contest!  **PRIZE:** $15 gift certificate for pizza wherever you want (or I'll call in the order for you if they don't do certificates).  **RULES:** The rules are simple. Make somebody's day on the internet. I don't care who it is, but don't try to scam me with alternate or friend accounts or you are disqualified. I don't care if you've gotten a pizza on here a dozen times or never, everyone qualifies.  Do an awesome random act of kindness for SOMEONE online and repost your deed here. It can be anything. Draw someone a picture they didn't expect. Post a simple and unexpected compliment. Do something that makes a stranger feel GOOD.  **DEADLINE:** **I reserve the right to choose the winner** at 8:00 PM Pacific time today (12/18). I'll likely be leaning towards the person with the most upvotes (but I may also go with the most generous act).  **NOTE:** Please no sad stories along your submissions. I won't pick you just because you did something nice while you were homeless or your puppies are starving. This is a FUN thread. Sorry :(  -------------------------  **EDIT:** I appreciate how many awesome things you guys have already done today, but I was hoping you'd go out of your way to do something for this post and not just list things you were already going to do.  -------------------------  **EDIT 2:** blaurum donated to Azlheimer's research and jnseals decided to donate two books in r/randomkindness! These are the sort of cool things I'm looking at (but please don't donate all your money, would defeat the purpose of a pizza!). You don't need to do anything that costs money, just make someone happy!  -------------------------  **EDIT 3: Less than an hour left and very few people are posting responses of nice things they've done for this contest. I think it's absolutely fantastic how many wonderful things you've all done already, but this contest is for things you did TODAY, AFTER READING THIS POST. Please make sure you brighten someone's day that you wouldn't otherwise have! :D**   -------------------------  **The winner is jnseals!! Hurray! Thanks so much everyone for the wonderful things you did today. I know there was a lot of competition, but there wasn't actually many people who really followed the rules. There were three contenders I could see who went out and did something nice specifically because of this post; jnseals did a book give away to a subreddit, blaurum donated $1 to a charity after this post, and wheeler donated in-game items to newbies in WoW.**  **I'll try to do another one of these soons so look out!**	True

My sister is TECHNICALLY on her 2nd semester as a Sophmore in college, though she officially has enough credits to be a Junior. Would anyone want to help us buy a celebratory pizza for the two kids?  BTW- We're in Kansas City, Mo and I will buy someone else a pizza in a few weeks	True

So I know I've asked a few times this week and I got a bunch of downvotes yesterday, but I want to give back in the only way I can. I have a discount code for **15% OFF AT PIZZA HUT** It's only good for online orders and while **15%** pales in comparison to Domino's half off sell, every little bit help.

t3_ndy9e	1323968462.0	Lizowa	pizza	[OFFER/Contest] A $15 e-giftcard to Domino's/Papa John's/Pizza Hut to a fellow college student going through finals week hell.	Alright, so I sold back some of my textbooks today and have a little extra money to spend. In the spirit of the holidays, why not give someone a pizza? I'm done with all but one of my final exams for this semester, and I know lots of you are going through finals hell right now too. There are two things I want from you:  * Tell me about your favorite class from this past semester, and why it was your favorite.  **AND**  * Show me a picture of you studying your ass off for finals.  Whichever post/picture I like the best will get the $15 to either Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut.  My only requirements are that you're a college student, you're in the US, and you're willing to use the verification code.   Good luck, and may the nerdiest one win!   **EDIT** Holy cow, this is going to be harder than I expected! There are some intelligent and hard-working redditors on RAoP. I'm loving hearing about your classes! And the pictures are certainly entertaining too haha. I'm going to pick a winner ~~at 3pm (Eastern time)~~ I've decided. Keep the stories/pictures coming!  **EDIT 2** I think I'm going to be out at 3pm, so I'm moving the deadline closer. 2:15 people! That's fifteen minutes. Go! Go! Go!     **We have a winner!!!**  [Congratulations, Shred_Kid!](http://i.imgur.com/P5jjQ.jpg)  Your story was very easy to relate to. Personally, I hate math and I'm really glad I don't have to take it again, but as far as Asian profs go, I'm sure my Korean teacher's adorable Korean accent would beat your Analysis prof's adorable Chinese accent haha. She also made us all Kimbap and stuff one time (better than hamburgers IMO...). You're also in a religious studies class, which I think is cool (being an anthropology major myself), your [/r/dota2](/r/dota2) friend seems to think you're a good person, and I fucking hate carrots, so it sucks that that's all you have to eat haha. What really won it for me though was the paper you're writing on Darfur. I'm part of my school's STAND organization, Students Taking Action Now for Darfur. It means a lot to me! It's cool to see others who care. Anyways, enough rambling, congratulations, I'll message you to get your verification code, etc.  And thanks to everyone else who participated! I loved hearing your stories :)	True

t3_ncujd	1323896768.0	Kitio	pizza-gold	[Offer][Contest] Last person to post wins a $15 gift card to dominoes.	** CONTEST OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!**  Its been awhile since I have done a contest on here. Hadn't really had any good ideas for any until late last night. So with that here are the rules fo the contest and how you win.  1. Make a comment to this post. 2. Have no one else comment after you for ~~2 hours~~. 1 hours 3. Every time someone comments, the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour timer restarts.  4. There is an end time I am not announcing to this contest and person closest to that wins if no one hits the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour time limit. 5. You can post as many times as you see fit.   This is going to be some what hard to track, so if you manage to beat the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour time limit, send me a message and tell me and I will go back through and verify. I do make mistakes, as does everyone so please bear with me as I try to verify winners. Depending how things go, the time limit may change to a lower amount, I will not raise the amount ever.  Usual crap I put in here, Read the right side, important that you read it because I will be following that.  Account MUST be over 30 days old, I don't want people making accounts just to get free pizza, contribute to the community and in short time you can participate too! U.S. Only. (Sorry people outside the U.S. here is a <3 to compensate!)  Let the contest begin.  Edit: Adding on, any comments i make don't count toward reseting the timer.  Edit2: Since I see some confusion, the timer resets on overall posts, not if someone replies to your post. Also, Time has been lowered to 90 minutes!  Edit3: So someone gave me an idea for another contest, which is going to make this one more interesting. Second contest it going to be the person that gets the most upvotes (RES is tracking them) from me (and specifically me) on the posts that they have on here. Going to make this a $10 gift card to dominoes. Since I can only give one upvote per post, post something interesting for me to watch or read and u get an upvote, want a second upvote? post something else interesting.  Edit4: To those sending me message, they are sometimes getting lost in all the comments.. So I apologize if I miss em.  Edit5: Since some people keep asking, the End time I have set is not going to be tonight. I wanna see if someone can accomplish this. I will end it some time tomorrow. I will also be lowering the time as it goes on. I will lower it once more tonight before I go to bed and have a time tomorrow it will lower again. No matter what though, please b patient as this has almost 350 comments already and its going to take a bit to find a winner. =P  Edit6: replies to posts do reset your count and since I put it up above, you cannot reset ur own timer.   Edit7: As I said in a post below, net went down last night so couldn't update time on here... But time is going down again to 1 hour. Currently the highest I am seeing is 53 minutes on time. Also, I am not trolling as my pizza at the top shows, I have given in the past (over 10 pizzas) and plan to do so in the future, I just like to make interesting contests.  Edit8: Back to work I go, time is still 60 minutes, I have decided to end it shortly after I get off work, Which could be sometime in the next 1-4 hours. So good luck! I will also give a 15 minute warning up here at the top. =P  Edit9: So I think at 650+ comments its time to end this... 50 minutes from whenever this edit was done, the contest will end. =P To clarify, its no longer who gets in and no one post after an hour, it is now who is closest to the end time that has been set.  Edit10: Contest over Winners are Mamayoda with the $15 gift card. and Reingding13 for the $10 gift card. - Taking a nap, both winners please contact me with a validation as listed on the right hand side. I will get gift cards out later tonight.	True

t3_nca79	1323861673.0	DEStudent	PIF	Upfront and Honest in Delaware	Good Afternoon all:  So most of you know I'm a wife and student and stepmother. I also volunteer for a crisis hotline. I posted a few days ago requesting Pizza Hut so my husband and I could have a little romance and time away from my stepson who has been a **Major pain in the neck**. I figure I would ask again. We have some food here until Friday, but pizza would be a nice treat. I enjoyed some last week thanks to JetBoyTerp. I don't have a sob story or anything. I'm just a stepmother, wife, student and volunteer that would love to just enjoy some pizza rather than left-over **generic sloppy joes**. In exchange for your kindness I will send you my husband and I's security catalog (home business) and 3 free safety reports. Not much I know but... Hey I'm trying. I just don't have much to offer.   Oh wait: If you would be kind enough to treat me to pizza, I would be kind enough to mail you a free Moody Teenager! Yes, that's right- a teenager. You know, the cell phone obsessed, back-talking, whiney person? That's a joke, people. :-) Anyway the catalog and security reports are all I can offer for now.  I hope you all have a great day! THANK YOU for reading  **Edit- wow, the haters are out already. I wish this reddit would block downvotes.... If I'm wrong, please forgive me but I keep noticing I'm being downvoted.

t3_naac7	1323735122.0	Stregano	pizza	[Offer] Random Act for some Pie	It is this once again.  Do something random.  I am giving one person a pie.  If you tell me you are hungry, or broke, or basically tell me in one way, shape, or form that you are looking for pie because you can't afford it, you will be skipped (no offense, but there are tons of Requests out there, so make another one and go that route if you are that hungry).  I don't care what you show me.  I don't care what skills you have.  Show me what interests you.  Interest me with it.  Be prepared for me to want to have a conversation about it with you.  If cardboard boxes interest you, let's me and you have a conversation about it.  I don't care what it is, but keep it random, and keep it fancy.  So, show me what you do, or something you like, or explain something, or post a song you wrote, I don't care.  Just make it something about you.  I will leave this up for a day or 2 (I haven't decided how long yet, I guess I am keeping it random myself as well).  So, come on RaoP.  Let's get random.  As I like to say (it is my thing, but if you want to use it, that is fine with me): keep it random and keep it fancy  EDIT: I forgot to add, I will decide randomly who gets it.  So do not think what you have to say is boring.  EDIT 2: somebody asked, in a slight way, how I pick who is randomly chosen.  What I did was wrote up a quick php script.  I assign each person to a number, and then run this php script 100 times (if there are a bunch of responses like there is here, I will run it 1000 times).  It is just a simple random number generator, so nothing fancy.  Each person gets a number. Whoever gets picked by my random generator the most times wins.  So while it is technically not 100% random since it is not possible to write a program that is 100% random, it is pretty close.  EDIT 3: sorry about the single day delay since I know I was talking about Tuesday or Wednesday, but winners will be announced today.  I got sidetracked since I am starting up a podcast (very early stages of starting it), and I did some recording for it last night.  There is a ton more work than I had anticipated for that.  It was midnight before I got done, and since I had to work in the morning, I just did not have time to plug you guys into my random number generator and run it.  I will edit this and PM the winners sometime tonight.  Yes, winners as in plural.  Since I said yesterday and I am a day late, I figured to make it up to you guys, I would do 2 winners just to show no hard feelings (I hope you guys can understand, as I had no idea doing stuff with a podcast would run me until midnight).  So, winners will happen tonight.  I can even lay down my schedule for tonight after work (I work until about 5 or 6pm Pacific time): I am going to Blockbuster to try and score some free blu-ray cases for the movies I bought yesterday during my lunch break (the manager was in a meeting, so I could not get them yesterday), then I am going home and immediately plugging you guys into my script and running it.  EDIT 4: I am setting up the script now.  I will have the winners, within the next hour or 2 tops (depending on how long it takes this script to run)  EDIT HURRAY FOR WINNERS!:  Sorry about that you guys.  The winners of this fun and random contest are bluedreams39 and hihi44.  Seriously, thank you guys for your patience.  This was very random, and if anybody wants to see the script I ran, it is very simple.  It just picks random numbers and I assigned people to numbers.  These 2 came up the most.  You 2 will get a msg from me for details.  Everybody gave me such an amazing week, and I hope the conversations I had with some of you gave you guys a better week as well.  Sorry if I did not talk to you, but I got an amazing response I was not expecting.  As always, keep it random and keep it fancy	True

t3_n9syd	1323709602.0	mitch3910	juicebox	[CAUTION] My Foodler account was locked out because of a RAOP snafu.  Avoid the same for yourself!	I was gifted $25 for foodler.com a couple months ago.  The order went through fine.  Last night, I tried to order for myself and after an hour and a half, I called the restaurant and was told they had no record of the order.  I've been going back and forth with foodler support today, and I found out the person who gifted me the $25 issued a chargeback over a month later.  Foodler decided the chargeback meant my account was compromised and locked my account.  I'm not sure how we can avoid something like this for the rest of us, but take this as a warning that these things can (and do) happen.  I really enjoy this subreddit and we all do great things here.  Let's try and keep this sort of thing from happening again, shall we?  tl;dr, RAOPer gifted me on foodler, issued a chargeback, and now my foodler account has been suspended.  Edit:  It seems foodler has chalked this up as a loss and they've unblocked my account.	True

I'm posting from a throwaway because I don't want to tie this low moment to my actual account, but I can prove I'm a long time redditor and relate any more information about my situation as requested.  I just want something more cheerful and pleasant than sitting here trying to figure out what to do next, and pizza would definitely go a long way. I think it's more the symbolic gesture of being gifted pizza by a stranger than the actual pizza that I'm going for here (though I am definitely hungry).  Thanks for your time.	True
t3_n8jzm	1323621976.0	CayucosKid	pizza-gold	[Offer] The two best art project ideas gets a $20 Dominos giftcard.	I've been way too focused on my organic chemistry final next week. Therefore I turn to you, Reddit. This technically isn't cheating because I'll be doing the work. Besides, the professor encouraged getting ideas from other people.  **So here is what the project consists of: It's pretty open ended with a few restrictions.**  This project should be created using any medium, and must be on any non-traditional canvas (No paper, cardboard, and no canvas). The subject matter is completely open ended, but the visual produced must be on a unique canvas that emphasized the overall concept.  I must be able to buy all the materials from Walmart - AND - and I must be able to do it before tomorrow (I'll have around 12 hours to work on it).  Materials I already have (I don't need to use any of them); clay, colored pencils, paints.  My original idea was to make "99%" using clay and after it hardens, glue a bunch of pennies on it. I was then going to make a "1%" with a bunch of $1 bills on it - the final object was an arm coming out of the 1% and taking the pennies off the 99%. I think this idea is way to advanced (and would probably take forever). I suck at sculpting anyway (but I'm open to ideas involving clay that don't need an incredibly amount of detail).  **This is just one idea though - I can't wait to read some of yours. I will announce the winners at 5:00pm central time.**  [Relevant picture.](http://i.imgur.com/SK0r6.jpg)  **Winners** I liked all of the ideas. Thank you very much to everyone that participated. Unfortunately only two can win however. The ideas I liked the best are from **blaurum** and **BrokeCollegeDude**.  I will most likely be doing my original idea but instead of making the arm out of clay I will use doll arms (a bunch of them - I think a bunch of them would make it look awesome). Thank you to blaurum for this great little idea that I didn't even think of. I will be sending out the giftcard codes as soon as they come into my email.	True

t3_n7myj	1323544422.0	jamaladams	shroom	[Request] Hungry, tired and depressed as wife sent me a letter today for divorce.	Dear Reddit users,  About  2 weeks ago my wife and I started having arguments over my wealth, after days of arguing my wife decided it was time that we needed "time alone" and went up north to spend time at home while I'm staying in our apartment, lonely for 2 weeks. Today she sent me a letter saying that she wants a divorce.  Now your probably wondering its a bit suspicious me having a Reddit account for nearly no time at all, but the truth is that my friend told me about this site and how he used it in the time of need. With a business that's failing ( the reason that she left me because she thought we'd been financially fine through out our marriage) and wife that doesn't love me for what I am I feel as though I have nothing left for this world. Would some one be kind enough to cheer me up with a Pie/Pizza every penny counts at this stage.  God Bless if someone does.  P.S If someone does I would like to pay  pizza(s) forwards back to the Reddit ROAP community in the future when I am able.  	True

t3_n7hct	1323533403.0	defprd	shroom	[Request] (IL) Pizza for a friend who needs to be cheered up...more info inside	So I've made a few requests on RAoP in the past couple months and have only gotten a pizza from winning a contest.  I know I've asked more times than I'd like to admit, but this time I'm not asking you to help me, but to help my best friend.   He's been living with one of our buddies since May of this year and the past month or two has been really rough for him.  Our buddy, I'll call him James, that my best friend is living with, did 2 tours in Iraq and he did some really messed up stuff that he's not proud of when he was there.  James came back 2 years ago and has not been the same since.  This guy has some really bad PTSD.  He rages a lot and gets into fights and does some really messed up stuff because he has flashbacks can't control himself.  Lately James had been threatening suicide and we've been helping him cope with his issues.  Last week he attempted suicide and we stopped him, but he still doesn't think he can handle living with himself.  Thursday night he tried suicide again so we ended up taking him to a VA hospital, and now he is living with his parents who are going to help take care of him and to get him the help he needs.  All of this has taken its toll on my best friend and he really is having a bad week.  He has had to deal with more of this than the rest of our group of friends because he lives with James and I feel that a pizza and a day away from all of this would help him out a lot.  If there is some that can help me out to cheer him up it would make my day and our friends would also be very grateful.   Thanks in advance.  Edit:  I have to go run some errands so I will check back on this in a few hours.	True

t3_n6ym9	1323481291.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[REQUEST] for a pizza for next week... US	I want a pizza.  I'd like it for next Tuesday.  Why Tuesday?  Well, my better half's stinkin' office Christmas party is that day.  And no significant others are invited, apparently.  BOOO.  So while he's swilling cocktails and eating a yummy dinner, I'll be all by myself.  Addressing Christmas cards.  Well, I'll have my dog.  And probably a bottle of wine.  But you get my drift.  I could go out and meet friends for dinner, cook, etc.  But better half hates most delivery pizzas and I love them.  I haven't had Papa John's, Domino's, Pizza Hut, NADA for TWO FREAKIN' YEARS!   So, a pizza would be awesome.    As always, this is NOT a sob story--I'm not flush for cash but certainly have plenty to eat--so if you only have a bit to give, **PLEASE** give it to someone who truly needs it.  I'll post pictures and even throw in pictures of my [Reddit Xmas tree](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/mkr5q/request_to_help_build_a_reddit_christmas_tree/) once it's decorated.

t3_n6dmb	1323449109.0	elgreco927	dragon	I'll come back to RAoP and give away 10 pizzas to hungry Redditors. Details inside.	So here's my proposal.  Please read this [X-post from /r/secretsanta](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/n37da/i_have_a_favor_to_ask_of_all_you_secret_santas/), and spread the word via FB, Twitter, upvotes, etc.  If my friend can meet her fundraising goal before xmas, I'll come back to RAoP and give away 10 pizzas.  **ORIGINAL POST:**  This may not be the right subreddit for this, but since we are all here to share a little joy this holiday season, I thought I'd make a humble request of this awesome reddit community.  I have been racking my brain trying to think of a xmas gift this year for a very dear friend of mine.  Today, she posted on FB about her fundraising efforts for the March of Dimes, and I got an idea.    She and her family have participated in the March for Babies walk every year since losing their 12-day-old baby daughter Tera back in 2001 due to a congenital heart defect.  Her FB post mentioned that any donations through the end of the year [will be matched](https://www.marchofdimes.com/giving/support_yearend.html), effectively doubling the donation.  I thought it would be awesome if a bunch of random redditors started donating to her [March for Babies team](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&ct=4&w=5202211&u=TeamTeraUT) out of the blue.  She would be dumbfounded.  Her fundraising goal is $500, and if she could meet that goal before XMAS, it would **BLOW HER MIND!**  So please, all you wonderful secret santas out there -- how about taking on one more giftee for any donation amount at all?  I'll pledge that if she reaches her $500 goal before Dec. 25, **I'll donate an additional $200 myself.**   So thank you all for reading this.  If you want to read up more on the charity, you can go to the [March for Babies](http://www.marchforbabies.org/) web site.  You can donate to my friend's team, Team Tera, on her team's [donation web page](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&ct=4&w=5202211&u=TeamTeraUT).  **THANK YOU!!**  -----------------------   **TL;DR** - As a gift to a friend, I'm trying to raise money for her [March for Babies fundraising team](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&ct=4&w=5202211&u=TeamTeraUT).  I'm hoping awesome secret santas such as yourselves might want to help.  :-)  -----------------------  **EDIT:** Dec 9 2011 @ 11:45am CST - Got a **HUGE** [donation from moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/n6dmb/ill_come_back_to_raop_and_give_away_10_pizzas_to/c36lm4z), and now we're at $205!!!  Please show him/her some love in the form of upvotes or anything else you can think of!  THANK YOU!  **EDIT:** Dec 11 2011 @ 11:00pm CST - We're currently 60% of the way there, with $300 raised so far!  Thank you!    ----------------  .  .  .  **GOAL MET!!!!** Thank you to everyone who made donations and spread the word, it truly is appreciated!     As promised, [I donated $200 more](http://imgur.com/a/IX1fu), and now I'll get started on giving away some pizzas!    And now, down to the important business of donating some pizzas to some hungry Redditors! I've already [given 1 pizza away](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nkgge/yay_for_elgreco927_and_pizza_thank_you/).  So that leaves 9 more.    **See my [new RAOP post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/npehz/offer_march_of_babies_fundraising_goal_met_im/) about giving away the first 3 of those 9 pizzas today!**  Thanks again, Reddit.

I was fortunate enough to receive a gift card from **toncinap** but Papa John doesn't want me to use his e-gift cards in Canada.

Be honest!!  I'll try to remember to give it out tonight but if not, tomorrow at the absolute latest.  P.S. I promised tonciap that I would send a picture of my puppy with the pizza when I got it.

t3_n2vce	1323201460.0	real-dreamer	shroom	I would like a pizza.	Hello, I'd like a pizza. I'm in **Minnesota** and I'm hungry, and kinda low on cash. I have ramen and hot dogs. But I'd prefer something more flavorful. I have to get a new starter for my car, a new charging cable for my computer (I'm on my computer at work) and find a new place to live.   So...

t3_n2l2j	1323186437.0	DEStudent	PIF	REQUEST- Just being honest in New Castle, Delaware 19720	Hey Reddit:  I'm coming to request pizza for lunch or dinner tonight. I don't want to be the queen of sob stories, I just want to be honest and give you a little information on what's going on. Well my stepson (17) made some very serious false accusations because he's got misdirected anger at Dad.  Since my stepson made these phone calls, he's felt like he's an untouchable... (I don't have to listen to my parents and you can't touch me!) But more than that, last night my husband and I got a phone call and the person that performed our marriage ceremony died of a massive heart attack. He was like an uncle and a mentor.   Pizza would really cheer me up and make this difficult time in life much easier. I have given before and received.  I'm a FT college student that volunteers for a crisis center and is married to a good man. And I know some where deep, deep, deep (did I mention DEEP) down inside, my stepson is a good kid too. Just going through a hard time since his mother kicked him out.  Thanks for listening and even if you can't give pizza, just a cyber hug or moral support is always welcome.   **THANK YOU**  **EDIT- THANK YOU TO JETBOYTERP for making a difficult situation a little easier to cope with! You are a special person, not just because you helped me, but I've seen the wonderfulness you've spread around reddit. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU**	True

Edit: ~~I chose FrankTheodore to receive random goodness. I hope to do this again when I have more moneys :D~~  Edit 2: The first one fell through, so I'm gonna choose someone else. Satire55 wins unless that falls through too!	True
t3_n1brx	1323107929.0	4cornerhustler	pizza	[OFFER] Contest:  Identify the city this picture was taken in and win a free pizza.	I recently came into a windfall via scratch off tickets, and I want to play a game.  I want to give away a pizza, but have no interest in sob stories.  Identify the city [this photograph](http://i.imgur.com/Isnfx.jpg) was taken in, using any tools at your disposal.  There are some very vague clues for someone who isn't from the area.  If no one has gotten it by 7 pm central, I will post another picture.  They will get progressively easier until the pizza is given away.  If you are from around here I will buy you a pizza from the local restaurant of your choice or a $20 dollar gift card.  If you are not from around here you will receive a gift card for $20 to just about anywhere.  EDIT:  It is not Chicago, but those who guessed that are getting closer.  The person with the library comment is on the right track to a good clue.  Figure out what kind of library that is and you will narrow down the possibilities.  Second picture will be posted soon.  EDIT:  Still no correct answer, so here is your [second photograph](http://i.imgur.com/XMxR3.jpg).  This one is taken from the east.  The first one is taken facing south from the shore of one of our Great Lakes.  From here on out, you are only allowed one guess per additional picture.  Some people seem to think this is too hard, but that's part of the fun.  Stay with this and you will have enough clues to solve the puzzle in no time.  EDIT:  We have a winner.  **Billy_West** is the man of the hour, and one of my favorite voice actors.  Gift card to domino's has been sent.  Enjoy.	True

t3_n0lub	1323056206.0	discrepancy09	pizza	[Offer]back! - Paying it forward, just like the movie!	Note: I posted this in RandomActsOfPizza first because I didn't know this was the "popular" one so I'm just gonna copypaste.   A while back, I got a pizza from this very same place. I wish I could remember who it was, but I can't find the PMs any-freaking-where. Will edit if I find em. [1] http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/icay5/request_a_pizza_from_reddit_would_help_but/    I was in a really shitty place 5 months ago. No money, no phone, no nothing. Now, I've got two jobs, paying a car note, moving into my own place and assuming guardian role of my little brother (who my father also kicked out, wtf.) Anyway, I was thinking about the pizza I got and how happy I was when I received it, when I remembered that I never paid it back! How fucked up of me.  Anyway, since it's the Christmas season and my credit card bill (yeah, I got one of those now too!) will be being paid in the next couple days, I figure why not spread the cheer a little and get some pizza! I'll definitely do one, but I just had to pay my registration on my car and my deposit on my new apartment so I'll see how many others I can do.  BUT, I want this to be interesting. If I decide to accept your request, I want something in return. The best part? It can be ANYTHING. Anything at all. Delivered digitally, delivered physically, it doesn't matter. The only catch is: it has to be something you somehow acquired/created/spawned on your own. Basically, I don't want a link to some picture from the internet or something like that. It can be a song, it can be a thank you picture, (but that's a little boring) it can be a drawing, I really don't care! Don't tell me what you're going to offer me until I accept your request, to make it a bit more fair. Well, have at it, Reddit. Shoot me your stories!   Edit: the user who bought me the pizza was unscientist.  Edit 2: Lots of replies! I have to go to work (two doubles in a row) but I will be sure to read through all the submissions and choose when I get off at 12 EST  Edit 3: Sorry guys. I've already chosen my two winners. Thanks!

Hey guys, I know there are a lot of requests right now, as there have been for a few days.  I've got two hungry girls here and dinner time is around 5 or so.  I've worked up an appetite since things are getting pretty busy over on RAoC (which is doing so great, can you believe it?!), and I was wondering if we could get some Papa Johns goodness today (they're the only ones that deliver out here and I don't have a car for carry out).  So if anyone wants to help, that'd be great! But if you can't, we've got some french fries and I can surely work magic of some sort.  As always, if there's someone else in more need than I am, then I always ask they come before me.  But today, I have two pretty brilliant girls hanging out with me, one who gave me 8 bucks to buy a Twilight related item for a Twilight-fan-child-in-need this year on RAoC.  That act itself, to me, deserves some pizza.    I'll shut up now.  Thanks for taking the time to look through my post.

(The "Jetboy is an idiot and forgot it was Friday" edition)	Sorry, I totally zoned this morning before I left...but better late than never...  The trick is to **guess the lowest number from 1 to 100, that no one else guessed.** Yes, whole numbers. Say you pick 9...two people pick 3, four people pick 7, and the next highest number picked is 9 and you are the only one who picked it, you win.  You need to **pm me your guess, and post in this thread that you have entered** ...something like "I'm playing" or "I guessed" or "Jetboy is a moron today so I better send a guess". Anyone who fails to both pm and post here is disqualified. One entry per person please :) Don't post your guess in this thread tho. Any questions, feel free to ask.  This is for a **$40 gift card** to your choice of Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns. ** Entries accepted until 7:00pm Eastern** (an hour later than usual this week since I forgot) Winner announced shortly after. Good luck!  Note: If someone outside the US wins, I'll try as hard as I can to get you a card or pizza or something. I can't guarantee I'll be able to tho. But I'll try.  Previous winning numbers:  Week 1 -- 4  Week 2 -- 6  Week 3 -- 29  Week 4 -- 9  Week 5 -- 23  Week 6 -- 4  Week 7 -- 10  **EDIT:**  It's 6:15pm, and I am here, so it won't take too long to get the winner and get that card out to him/her shortly after 7pm.  **EDIT:** 7:00pm!

t3_mxqna	1322848490.0	shaynagier	shroom	[REQUEST] Birthday Pizza?	Technically speaking, my birthday is Dec 25, more commonly known as Christmas Day. Small rant- somehow anytime I say "Dec 25th" EVERONE says "oh, Christmas!" But if I say I was born on Christmas they look at me and are like "December 25?" As if there's another Christmas day *shakes head* Anyways, rant over.  I'm a pizza hut member and in my e-mail I got a coupon for a free breadstick in honor of my birthday with my next order. The thing is, I prefer birthday stuff to be totally free so I thought I'd see if anyone here wants to give me a birthday e-card so that I can have a totally free birthday meal.   Also, my husband starts work Monday and I'd like to give him a congratulatory pizza.  I'm in Kansas City, Mo   Info- I've posted a few other times, recieved one pizza by request and one by a "contest". And I'm putting up a give-away soon  Edit: My offer is posted- [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/mxsqg/offer_shayna_selects_someone_so_someone_shall/)	True
t3_mxpw3	1322847406.0	I_know_that_movie	FAP	[Request][VA]Poor graduate students 	Graduate studies have been bittersweet.  While one of us has just completed Oral Comprehensives (yesterday), which was reason to celebrate (but did not occur), we were recently told this week that we will have to wait another semester to graduate (stylistic issues with thesis format).   Along with this, we have been bummed about the school situation and money has been extremely tight (ramen starts to lose it's appeal with repeated visits and there is only so much bologna a human being can eat).  I think a night of "eating out" could really help relieve us, if not just for one evening, of the reality of the 'poor college syndrome.'  A pie could make our tight budget seem a bit looser, but I understand if givers are reluctant, as even I can scroll down the screen and see that some requesters are in greater need than the two of us.   Even if no assortment of congress approved vegetable servings are afforded, I will be back here in the coming months (once tax refunds come through) to help some who are in need.  Thanks RAoP.  EDIT: Thanks cab360 :) You are absolutely amazing . . . we might have actually gotten a whole serving of veggies from the pizza you sent! Pics are posted, thanks again, you made our day and we can't wait to pay it forward when things start to look up.

t3_mxpe6	1322846631.0	jellybean545	shroom	Help me celebrate the (almost) end of my first semester of Nursing School! 	Dear RAOP,   I am in my first semester of Nursing school, and just completed a week that had four exams and two papers. This was the last regular week of classes before finals. It has been a crazy few months. Anyone that tells you nursing school is easy is LYING. Or a robot. Either one. But anyways, I've tried really hard to study, practice, and read. There hasn't been much time left for the whole eating/sleeping part of life. I guess I just wanted to take the afternoon off from everything and relax to do something for myself, including eating my weight in pizza. I was just wondering if someone would be kind enough to contribute a pizza for (perhaps) your future nurse? I live in New Hampshire, I moved here to go to school and don't know a ton of people, so it'd be nice to think that I have a buddy somewhere out there to virtually share lunch with me. Thanks guys, even just writing this made me feel better :)   Edit: I will definitely be paying this forward! Thanks guys!	True

t3_mxgp2	1322829826.0	BOTW	pizza-gold	[OFFER] - My weekly college-student Friday Pizza drawing	OK, it's Friday again. Here's my 16th weekly offer to a college student. Your name must be submitted by Friday at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern. **I have a job on the schedule today that may make me a half-hour or so late...we'll have to see.**    1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must be taller than the period at the end of this sentence. (give me a break...I keep trying to come up with new "conditions" for this third spot, and it's getting tough!)  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also **tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's**. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time (maybe 3:30 this week), I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ----------------------------  **OK, a little late, but I pulled the winners. Yes, again, I said multiple winners one for Papa Johns and one for Domino's, because there were 94 entries this time...so I split them into two stained coffee cups, one for each pizza preference.**   **The Domino's winner is: Razor_x_Blade, and the Papa John's winner is Sub_Par. I'll be PM'ing them their gift cards. Happy Friday, everybody! **	True
t3_mx71m	1322804155.0	south_austinite	shroom	[REQUEST] I want to RAoP an amazing mother that just lost her 22-year-old daughter to Cystic Fibrosis.	Five years ago, I met an amazing girl, Amberlyn Fett. At six weeks old, she was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis. Sixteen of her twenty-one Christmases were spent in the hospital. Because of that, she created an organization to bring Christmas to children in Central Texas hospitals, called [Amber's Angels](www.ambers-angels.org). She hand delivered gifts, often times purchased out of her own families pockets, to hundreds of children for the past seven years. She received a double lung transplant two years ago, extending her life just a while longer. In August, she went into rejection and passed away at age twenty-two on November 18, 2011. This has been absolutely devastating for the family, particularly Amberlyn's mother. Despite her grieving, she was out Black Friday, helping Amberlyn's memory live on by purchasing toys, 100 blankets and several other items to make sure these children have a Christmas. I have donated as much money as I'm personally able to, but I thought someone else might be interested in helping Debbie understand how appreciated and loved she is.   Thank you for taking the time to read.   Austin, TX	True

We are barely paying our bills and currently have no money for groceries and are out of basically anything edible. I put a check in the ATM last night but it hasn't cleared yet, so our bank account is still in the negative. I had a phone interview for a new job today, so hopefully I get it and things will be looking up soon! But in the meantime, my family is very hungry tonight and I have no idea what we are going to eat. If anyone could help us out with dinner tonight, I will buy someone else a pizza tomorrow when my check clears. Full disclosure: I have received one pizza in the past (several months ago).

t3_mwl6r	1322773759.0	IdTugYourBoat	tugboat	[OFFER]{CA} Bitch, it’s the holiday season, a time for giving pizza.	**Holiday Season Pizza Giveaway Marathon Extravaganza**  For this contest, you’ll need fly acro-**Bitch**, I said *giveaway*; ain’t no silly contest rules to be had here.  Okay, this is how it’s going to work.  I’m going to be giving away pizzas.  Yes, that’s right, *pizzas*; as in multiple, more than one, numerous, several.  To acquire said pizza, you’ll need to:    **1.** Alert the world that you would like a pizza via comments.  **2.** After I’ve contacted you or something like that, send me your shit (email address and pizza preference) and verification code.  **3.** Wait in anticipation of a delicious piping hot pie.  **4.** Don a ridiculous holiday sweater so the delivery guy can have a good laugh.     At the moment, there is no limit on how many pizzas I plan on giving away.  Just ask and I’ll give.  I don’t need sob stories.  I don’t care if you’re a college student living off top ramen, a single mother living paycheck to paycheck with a dozen mouths to feed, a frequently masturbating goat herder, or just a lonely person needing some cheesy closure; whatever, I don’t care.  I’ll give you a goddamn pizza.  I am by no means wealthy, so this will go on as long as I don’t start fretting about my financial wellbeing, or my funds are depleted-whichever happens first.  I’ll give until my wife threatens to leave me, whatever; I’m giving away pizzas.  If this breaks my bank, I don’t care, because guess what?   I’m fresh out of fucks.   **Disclaimer:** I’m just going to ignore requests from accounts with a lifespan of under 24 hours because I don’t want people trying to get me to give to them twice.   **TL;DR** Read it if you want your pizza, you twit.  **Edit1** This is proving to be more difficult than I anticipated.  I have close to twenty some tabs opened just trying to sort out who's who in the zoo. Since I’m being swamped with requests, I’ve had to enlist the help of my hot secretary to sort through the details of the requests.  [Bear with me](http://i.imgur.com/6pAve.jpg), you’ll get your pizza.   **Edit2** Holy fucking cunt-licking shit, everybody calm the fuck down. I'm but a mortal man.  **Edit3**  My hot secretary has graciously offered to donate **2 $20** gift cards to this giveaway (they’ve been only $10 up till now, sorry trying to give as much as possible).  Unfortunately, she insisted on actually holding a little contest for these.  First to guess her bra size gets the first one; first to guess the color gets the second.  You only get one guess, and can’t guess for both (her words, not mine).  Also, read the fucking rules--waste of time when I have to reply to "what info do you need?"   **Edit4** Sorry folks, as of 2:22 PM PDT, this is closed.  My wife’s really letting me have it.  Apparently if I keep this charade up, my unborn daughter won’t be able to attend college.  If your comment was posted before this I'll still get to you, anyone after that, I'm sorry if I wasn’t able to get to you. Sorry I had to close it so soon, I had not idea it would blow up in just one hour. I was literally receiving 10+ message notifications by the minute.  Hot secretary contest is still going.  **Edit5** Mommabear0816 finally got purple; size is still up.  **Edit6** Fun fact: I now have my credit card number committed to memory. Also, 10 bonus points are awarded to rwheeler720 and RyenDeckard for thoroughly mind fucking me.  **Edit7** Kudos to RobSpewack for finally guessing 34C. Also, those of you who I've pm'd but have not responded: anytime today would be fantastic. I have many things to do, which may or may not include filing for bankruptcy and/or divorce.  Also, you all owe me pics of you with your pizza and whatever it is you did with it; that is all I ask.  **Edit8** Logged on this morning to find a multitude of messages in my inbox and **reddit gold**. The hell people? It's just pizza. My unborn daughter needs to go to college, dammit, is reddit gold an acceptable currency? Those of you who I said I'd get before this tremendously stupid idea of mine ended yesterday, hang on, I'm still wading through my inbox. Also, if you haven't received your gift card, let me know so I can call those pretentious bastards and give them what for.	True

I'm a wife and stepmother and today has just been incredibly trying. We have an out-of-control teenager who we love, but makes it nearly impossible to like. He recently made some FALSE accusations that could ruin lives all because he doesn't want to live with us. He wants to live with his mother but not only did she put him out once, but twice and has told him emphatically, he is not welcome in her home. I made a pot of spaghetti and meatballs, but to be honest, I would love nothing more to stay locked away in hubby and I's bedroom and just enjoy pizza. Imagine rearranging your whole life for a child that disrespects you and your home...  So that's my request. Would really love some pizza. As I said, not starving. Just hoping for a treat.

In the past, my husband and I have already received 2 pizzas from you guys, but I'm not really in a position to re-pay those back yet (it is coming soon though and I can't wait!)  We finally got into a new apartment and are moving in tomorrow. As most of you know, apartments aren't cheap and if you add in the cost of deposits and first months rent all at once, it's kind of cleared out what little money we had in the bank, as well as made us in debt to a friend.   Anyways, tonight is the last night we are staying with my inlaws, and I'd greatly appreciate getting to surprise them with a pizza, or else if someone replies tomorrow maybe a pizza to feed those who are helping us move in.  I swear we will be giving out pizzas in the future to come, we just can't at the moment.

I've got some rice and beans along with a couple packs of Ramen...please spare me from this meal again.  Before Thanksgiving, our meals consisted of rice, beans, ramen, hot dogs and mac n cheese.  Now we are down to 3 packs ramen, rice and beans.~~  ~~For the love of gawd, I REALLY don't want that again.  With feeding 9 people, it would be best to get a couple of subs for the olders and a pizza or two for the youngers.  I'd do back flips and cart wheels for some good ole Donatos  www.donatos.com  the giver could order online and place the order/pay right on their site for delivery.~~   ~~I am on overload and need a break.  A nice meal would hit the spot for sure.  Would make these kids super happy and in return would make my night better too!~~	True

t3_mnd0w	1322096004.0	KeiroD	FAP	[REQUEST] Let's try one more time. :(	Hi, guys. I may be requesting a bit too much. If I am, please, do let me know... but I've not had much luck.  I am in Indianapolis, Indiana. There is a Pizza Hut, Domino's, Donato's and I think Papa John's around here.  What I'd like to try for is a Pizza Hut e-gift card. Approximately $50 would be great, as it'd last me just enough to get to December 1st, with perhaps a bit more left over. I'm trying to hold out, and I've sought help from Food_Pantry, which I've gotten, but the package has yet to arrive. I do not know how long it will be before it shows up.  So, with that knowledge, I'd like to try making one last appeal before I go silent and wait until the first of December to pay it forward to those that already asked here for me to do so.  I also have a verification code ready for those that ask.  I've pretty much decided to just continue drinking tea. If nothing else, I'll simply wait until I get the package and start eating again, as it's been just over a week since I last ate. Not much else I can do, aside from that.  Thanks, to those of you who decide to help me out. And, I apologize if I am indeed requesting too often.  Edit: Was unaware I needed to add my location. Added.	True

t3_mhr4t	1321676886.0	Defiledxhalo	FAP	[Offer] (Must be in US) Guess my NaNo!	So, this month is NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month; look it up if you feel like it), and of course, I'm participating! Now, seeing as how November's almost over and I'm more than halfway through my story, I would like to ask YOU redditors a simple question.  Guess the plot of my story! It's not that original, but there's LOTS of things going on in this story, so the person who gets the closest/most accurate/most guesses will get pizza!    This ends on Sunday (Nov 20th) 8 pm Eastern Standard Time.   GOOD LUCK! :D  **UPDATE!**  This was a HARD choice.  For the record, it seems that many of you looked up my username and guessed my story from last year's nano. XD  (Which was a dark vampire story.)  So tough luck, but I have a different story this year :P    What my story is about (I'm REALLY bad with summaries): It's a utopian/dystopian novel where it follows a girl named Paper (everybody in the world is named after an object).  She's been having these curious dreams that she feels are messages & decides to try to make her dreams a reality, making her a freedom fighter in the world. Through this encounter, she finds a guy with a non-object name, John Smith, who she feels have been sending those messages in her dreams, and partners with him to break out of their enclosed world. The reason why she wants to break out is because everyone knows that anyone who breaks the law is immediately taken and sent outside of the walls as a "soldier" for this ongoing war (and never returns), and so she of course wants to investigate.  What she doesn't know is that John Smith is a government spy who views her as a potentially dangerous citizen and is out to stop her at every cost :D  So, when looking through the people who guessed, it was really hard to try to see who's was the closest.  It went down between **pookie85** and **eross2010**. You both have major elements in my story, even if it was slightly different or wasn't included in my story at all.  In the end, I chose **eross2010** because even though it wasn't necessarily about cops/serial killers, the protagonist is fueled by trying to get to the  bottom of a series of murders (outside the wall anyway), thinks that John Smith knows a lot of information which is why she's following him around, and there is a general love interest between these two people, but you know, death and stuff are involved.  So **eross2010**, send me a PM with your address and whether you like Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, or Dominos!  Thanks to everyone else who tried!	True

t3_mb9vu	1321233318.0	hawkeyepeers	shroom	Thank You Mr. Slugworth!	Many thanks to Badbrownie. You compared my living situation to that of the family in ["Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"](http://i.imgur.com/Ih1kG.jpg), in response I must say that the [pizza factory](http://i.imgur.com/0TBXv.jpg) was a lot of fun to visit. Sadly I did not win the factory because of my overwhelming need to obtain the ["magic bacon producing pig"](http://i.imgur.com/YiBle.jpg)... Wonka says that I will heal in due time... Then we got the pizza from [Dominos](http://i.imgur.com/OPPY6.jpg)! We split up the card so that my wife and I got a [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/KwWEN.jpg) last night (Kiddos were asleep), We had pizza for [lunch](http://i.imgur.com/1E9Nq.jpg) today, and we had Pizza for [dinner](http://i.imgur.com/JhPoR.jpg) as well! We were so grateful for your generosity that we had a ["Badbrownie party"](http://i.imgur.com/bfFI9.jpg) for desert. In order to have a Badbrownie party, the brownies needed to, of course, be bad. I had the kiddos explain [why their brownies were bad](http://imgur.com/a/nfiQn#0). Everybody had a great time, that is except for [Grune](http://i.imgur.com/DWPKI.jpg)!    	True

t3_mbbz9	1321236715.0	blue_eyedsweetie	FAP	[Request] Not happy to be on here asking again but me and my son are not having a great night :(	As some may know Friday was my husbands birthday and we thought we would be able to deposit my really small check inside the bank but we were wrong..oops forgot it was a holiday. So on top of not being able to do very much for my hubbys birthday (luckily we had a gift card for applebees from a generous redditor for his bday dinner) we have almost no money for this weekend. My last bit of funds had to go to refill my bus fare card for work today and for the week. I will be unable to deposit until tomorrow and it wont even clear till Tuesday.  In the meantime, my husband went to work and I have cleared out our food staples this weekend. I made my son one meal so he wouldn't get too hungry and didn't feed myself. Now he is telling me he is hungry again, and my stomach is starting to rumble.   I am really sorry to be asking but we don't need much. Just for tonight for me and my son. I will pay if forward in anyway I can through assistance, raop, or randomkindess. Thank you kind redditors for reading in my time of need :)  Edit oops Im feeling really scatter brained, sorry for not posting location Southern CA USA  EDIT 2: I had an offer but she and I realized it was too difficult her being in Canada and me in the states. She sent me an awesome gift. Still looking for a little dinner help before we have to go to bed.	True

t3_mb2vb	1321221121.0	rainbowpig	shroom	[Request] Coming out to parents tonight	I'm 16 and very afraid that my dad will kick me out of the house. I've decided that tonight is the night that I will tell my parents that I am gay. My aunt knows and she will be coming over later today, because I'm so afraid things will get out of control. My mother and father have made it clear that homosexuality is a sin and that they would want nothing to do with me if I ever decided to be gay. My father has even gone through my room when I'm out of the house. I feel like I have no privacy and nothing left to lose if they find out. Hopefully someone out there has been in this position before. I'm nervous, scared, and feeling like this is going to be the last meal I have in the house. I know there are others out there who may have a real need for a meal tonight, but I'm simply here to request a pizza as comfort food. My name is Ben and I live in Bellevue, WA. I am proud of who I am and I am no longer going to continue hiding the truth. Thank you for reading my wall of text.  I didn't know where to post my update either in the comments or to edit this post. Well, my parents came home and my aunt came over. I told my parents that I had something important to share with them and that I wanted to be completely honest with them. After telling both of them I was gay, dad began screaming at me. Mom just sat there for a minute before she started crying. When I saw how upset she was, I started to cry too. Dad meanwhile was telling me how disgusting I am and that all gay people should burn in hell. I tried to calm him down, but at one point he raised his hand at me and my aunt told him not to hit me. My aunt got in between us and I really think he would have hit me. He took a deep breath and stormed out of the house. Mom got up and ran to her bedroom. My aunt said that I did the right thing and that she was going to speak with my mom. I'm sitting here now shaking, because I don't feel safe. I feel like I've done something horrible. I can still hear mom crying. I shouldn't have done this. I've destroyed my family tonight.   I don't feel safe staying here, so I'll be staying at my aunts house tonight. I'm hoping mom and dad will at least talk to me tomorrow. Neither of my parents have ever lifted a hand to me and I'm worried that things got out of control so fast. I have my bag packed and I'm ready to leave. Thank you all for your support and kind words. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but I just hope they'll at least talk to me peacefully. I have a feeling this isn't going to be resolved overnight and I will have to remain strong through this.	True

All of my paycheck goes to rent, and then I'm left with nothing. I make tips so I can try to supplement that for gas, cat food, etc. I'm just looking for a little pick-me-up in the form of a pizza. Any help would be appreciated. I have never received before, but I did log on today to find that someone had responded to my post the other day, but I didn't catch it. I don't know if she's online today or not. If you help me, I can send a screenshot of a PM to her telling her I already received. I'm just paranoid that someone is going to think I'm double dipping.

t3_m9i5u	1321072561.0	higherlogic	pizza	[OFFER] Thanksgiving dinner package for 6-8 people	I'm offering a Thanksgiving dinner for a needy family, which includes the following:  * 14 lb turkey * 2 lbs of stuffing * 1 qt turkey gravy * 2 lbs mashed potatoes * 1 qt cranberry sauce  This product comes from Amazon. Unfortunately, I've never ordered this before so I can't give it a review. Here's the product page:  http://www.amazon.com/AviGlatt-Thanksgiving-Dinner-Package-People/dp/B0064QU1CG/  Your choice of Honey Glazed, BBQ Glazed, or Hawaiian Marinade (I'd go with Honey Glazed personally).  This is really only for families that are truly in need of this (as this subreddit goes). Share your favorite Thanksgiving memory and I'll choose the winner from there, followed by a PM to get shipping information. All costs are covered by me (a **$94.44** value).  Please make sure [you're verified](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/) as well.  Since this isn't done via Amazon Prime, and I'm guessing it's probably 1-2 day because of the raw turkey, I can only ship this to the continental 48 states. We can figure out what would be the best day to have this sent as well once a winner is chosen.  **Edit #1**  If you'd prefer a $100 gift card or pre-paid Visa to your local grocery store I can do that instead.  By the way, here is the company website where the food is coming from:  http://www.aviglatt.com  **Edit #2**  I've picked someone who I (and others) feel deserve this. I wish I could give to more of you, but thankfully someone PMed me and offered to buy this for someone else too. I'm going to send PMs to both people shortly.  **Edit #4**  By the way, [goudie](http://www.reddit.com/user/goudie) has offered to give the same dinner package out. I had 5 choices, and since I picked mine, here are 2 other people who I felt could use this:  1. MeechPeach 2. taransean  I'm awaiting **goudie's** reply on who he/she wants to send this to, but if anyone else would like to offer this dinner package to one of the above (or anyone you feel could benefit greatly from this), that would be awesome.  I hope everyone has an amazing Thanksgiving, and I really wish I could give more of these out to everyone who responded that's going through a difficult time, whether financially, due to illness, or the loss of a loved one.  Have a safe and happy holiday season everyone!  **Edit/Update**  User **goudie** has also offered someone a $100 prepaid card or the package dinner (I ended up doing a prepaid because you get more bang for the buck). A big thank you to him or her for doing this!!!	True

t3_m97nu	1321051649.0	shaynagier	shroom	[request] Celebratory Pizza for Amazing Hubby	Hi Reddit, my name is Shayna and my husband posted here asking for a pizza the last night we were in our apartment. I very much appreciated our free pizza and look forward to giving someone else a pizza when I have the money. For now, however, this is not possible. If you want to ignore all the story stuff just know this- I would greatly appreciate it if someone could buy me and my husband a pizza to celebrate him getting a job.  Extended story:  I have asperger's and have been on disability since sept 13th as I just could'nt handle working anymore. Since that time one of the few people I actually connected to in life- my grandmother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and given 2 weeks up to 6 months with treatment to live. She passed away two weeks after the diagnosis due to a blood clot in her leg. The good news is that she didn't go through the worse of the cancer taking over. The bad news is she was like a mother to me and this event has reverted me back to the mental state I was in before going on disability-only now I'm not working and I feel stuck about what to do.  Meanwhile, my husband has been looking for a job for the past two and a half years. Due to a lot more of crappy circumstances, two and a half years ago before we got married he had a job and was forced to quit after 5 months of working there, disqualifying us for most assistance and unemployment benefits. In the 2.5 years since he's filled out several hundred applications, gotten only a handful of interviews, and a lot of " sorry this position has been filled", "we aren't hireling now but I'll hold your app", "call back later",  and other such messages. Today we finally got a call back after an interview for a secondary interview during which he is basically guaranteed a job offer on Monday . It's actually a great deal, both in pay and benefits and very much the answer to my prayers.  So here's why I'm writing you. Currently we're staying at my mother-in-law and her sister until the 20th, at which time we aren't sure where we will be staying. We've got no cash at all but I'd really like to offer my husband a celebratory pizza for getting the job cause I know he's felt like giving up more than once and just accepting that a job would never come. Also, while dealing with the chaos of trying to get a job, I received my diagnosis and he's had to deal with my losing it mentally if not for him. Also, the food we brought with us is running low.  So please help me?	True

Rules are listed.  * Must use one of my [templates](http://imgur.com/a/xoKJp) or create one similar.  That is all. In other words, tell me something funny Jesus said to you.

I would say most upvoted picture wins, but according to some people in recent posts, people cheat. So I alone will decide the winner. (Or if so many people comment on how funny your picture was then I guess you win) That is all.  God bless.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **EDIT**: Going with *Matt_and_Chelle*'s idea, I would like the givers to decide who wins by commenting on which one they like. If no givers read this, I will just make a decision in an hour (6:30PM PST).

I was forced to choose between my phone bill and more food and I had to choose my phone because I can't get a job without one. I have never asked for pizza, I won one in a drawing from BOTW a few weeks ago.

t3_m7yqr	1320964228.0	pookie85	FAP	Last call to be part of the RAoP video I'm making. Clicky Clicky. 	Tomorrow evening at 7:00PM (EST), I'm going to hit the render button on Sony Vegas to start saving the video I've been working on since Sunday-ish.  If you would like to be included in this video, all you have to do is link me to your thank-you photo you've previously posted, or you can make a new one.  I would like to see some pictures of thumbs up, with RAoP somewhere in the picture (piece of paper, hand, etc), or you can just put "Thank you, RAoP" and you can feel free to include your username.  I want to see smiiiiiles.  I want to see happy faces of people who just got pizza from a stranger and it's made their night.  If you've received from here before, you know what I'm talking about!  And if you don't want to put your face in the photo, that's entirely fine!  Do you have a dog? A cat? An awesome action figure?  Cool.  Just put your little paper sign beside of them and snap that picture.  I really hope that you want to participate, because I really want this to be the most awesome video ever.  Thanks for reading.  May the force be with you.  Live Long and Prosper. xx  **Edit:** I have been getting a few offers for a pizza since I'm making this video, but in all honesty, I'd prefer if pizzas went to those who needed them this weekend.  Though I wouldn't mind a pack of cigarettes, I know that won't happen. Btw; why is there not a random acts of nicotine?!  I'm kidding.  But if you **did** want to help me in some way, I would appreciate a dollar donation towards my NaNoWriMo fundraiser I'm doing.  You don't have to, but if you wanted to help a gal out, I'd surely appreciate it.  Otherwise, thank you to everyone who has submitted photos and I'll be uploading the video probably around 11PM tonight, as well as linking it here once it's uploaded.  I use Sony Vegas Pro, and it takes nearly a whole day to upload to Youtube, though I'm not entirely sure why.  Thanks for taking the time to read this ridiculously long additional text.  xx  **NaNoWriMo Author Sponsorship Page:**   http://www.stayclassy.org/fundraise?fcid=158321	True

Also, I promise to pass this forward once I'm back on my feet...  edit:  Delivery driver leaving, etc: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnVtYli87mM  Since my phones microphone doesn't pick up noises 2 friggen feet away here is a transcript:  *  Brother: "I don't get it, why would they do this?" *  Me: "It's called random acts of pizza." *  Brother: "What's the advantage for them?" *  Me: "There is no advantage, they're just being nice." *  Brother: "Do you just tell them you are starving or something?" *  Me: "Depends.."   There was also a video of the driver coming up but I felt bad for flashing a crazy bright light in his face. He seemed very confused about the whole thing. Gruk paid for the tip as well, and being a previous delivery driver years ago this made me very happy. It is especially nice since he didn't know how much to give not being from a location where tipping is expected and gave a crazy generous 15%. Probably fed the driver as well.   Also, My girlfriend thinks that MY cat was not properly shown in the pictures. So here is a video of my cat sucking on a wool blanket. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3gkNbAH-c	True

[Ohio-USA]	Me so hawngry, Love you long time!  edit: Love Gruk long time! http://imgur.com/a/iLSg6#0  Seriously though Gruk, the last few weeks have been really shitty and this is about the nicest thing someone could have done to cheer me up... If there is anything I can do for you please don't hesitate to let me know.  Enjoy your Skyrim!

Any way to edit the post title to say that it was accomplished? 	True
t3_m67tr	1320855991.0	Chr1831	pizza	[OFFER] $10 gift card to the most funny story someone writes (Deadline: 2:30PM -8 GMT)	I've had a pretty bad week so I figured I could use some laughs.

t3_m5kcd	1320804339.0	Azuth	pizza	[Offer] Bedridden sick dude looking for some entertainment.	EDIT: Gift card sent to ChanimalCrackers.     Been out of commission/in and out of the hospital for the past few weeks with a triple-whammy of mono, strep throat, and hepatitis. Sleeping for 18 hours a day and can't get out of bed for the other 6. Reddit can only entertain me so much and I'm close to adding boredom to my list of life-threatening diseases. So, are there any websites/things I can do with a computer that can offer a few good hour's worth of entertainment?  I've already exhausted the following sources:  -Netflix -Reddit -StumbleUpon  I'm running on a Gen1 Macbook air so I can't really run too graphically detailed games, but if you guys know of any free/cheap, low-graphics, preferably multiplayer games that works too.  Person who posts what I judge as the best/longest lasting source of entertainment within 1.5 hours gets 25 dollars of Dominos.	True
t3_m4w3y	1320767981.0	DEStudent	PIF	(Request) DDDD?	So what is DDDD? Doesn't DEStudent Deserve Domino's? Hey all. Hope everyone is well. I figured I would try requesting for two reasons. 1. I finished my Abnormal Psychology class with an A. YAY! Also, I've been dealing with a health issue lately. I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and I've been back and forth with doctors. I don't like the endocrinologist I saw yesterday but the next appointment available with another one isn't until April. It's just frustrating and difficult. Now this isn't to say oh, my problems are worse than anyone else's but I was just feeling like pizza today. So, DDDD? :-)  Those of you that know me- know I do pay it forward, but since I'm a student, it may take me a little bit of time but I love my fellow redditors and will help out any way I can. Thank you all for reading!  **EDIT: Someone very special, kind and caring gifted me with pizza!* Honestly, kind words and knowing I'm not alone, often mean more than the pizza. Yet the pizza is so yummy at times. THANK YOU! I don't know if my pizza person wishes to stay anonymous so thank you**	True

t3_m4oga	1320747969.0	milkasaurous	PIF	[Requset] Help cheer up a guy having a rough time?	Hey there RAOP,  Been having a tough two days. Money's real tight, no real food around aside from the Halloween candy that the Trick-or-Treaters I *didn't* get *didn't* take, arguing with the girlfriend, and I guess I quit smoking two days ago because I can't afford cigarettes so I feel a little sick and agitated. So...I'm giving in and asking for a pizza to help brighten my day a bit (and quell some of the hungry).  Now, I hate asking without giving anything in return, but, I have failed to make the grade in any contests. So, I can offer some haikus of your choice of topic or perhaps some (poorly drawn) pictures in return for some delicious Domino's pizza?  Thanks guys.  --Milkasaurous  >Edit: Forgot my location. I'm in the U.S. in New Jersey.	True

t3_m4396	1320707600.0	DEStudent	PIF	(Offer) Will buy a pizza for someone on 11/10 that can help me with a paper tonight... 	Hello:  So this is what I have to write about:  Tina is a 23 year old black female. She is currently separated from her husband of five years. She is currently employed by two companies, one at which she works Monday- Thursday mornings, and the other on Wednesday – Friday evenings, and all day Saturday and Sunday. However, she hasn’t shown up for work on a consistent basis for the last four weeks, and not at all in the last two days.      Once an energetic, active, healthy female who loved to exercise at the local gym three days a week, Tina now spends most of her time in her apartment. She hasn’t been to the gym in over four weeks, and her body movements that used to be quick and marked are now slow and sluggish. Even though she hasn’t changed her eating habits, Tina has been losing weight.      Joe, Tina’s husband, left her for another woman approximately four weeks ago. When she found out, Tina immediately locked herself in her room and cried herself to sleep. That night, she slept for about twelve hours straight, but that was the last time she had a long stretch of true sleep. Since then, Tina’s sleep habits have been very erratic; sometimes she will sleep for a few hours in the day, some in the evening. She finds herself unable to sleep longer than four hours at a time; as a result, she is constantly fatigued.      When she is awake and able to think clearly, which isn’t 100% of the time, Tina is fixated on where she went wrong in her marriage. She feels that if Joe left her for another woman, it must be because she must not be good enough, just like she wasn’t good enough for her own father to stay at home when she was seven…he left her and her mother, so she must not have been good enough back then, either.      Tina thought that when she married Joe right out of high school, it would be so wonderful. She had such great plans for the two of them...they would both work their way through college and be successful. But it didn’t work out that way, and Tina had to work two jobs just to keep food on the table and the rent paid, because Joe felt it more important to hang out with his friends all day long. If only she had worked harder, or been prettier, or sexier. That must be a lot of it, Tina thinks. She isn’t pretty enough, or hard working enough, or good enough, or sexy enough, which is why Joe left her. She was always so tired from working so much, that it was all she could do to crawl in the bed to sleep, much less give Joe the sex he wanted so often.     Tina believes that because of whom she is and what she has done, no one will ever love her and she will never have a relationship again. She keeps saying over and over how worthless she feels, and that her working all the time must have contributed to the downfall of the marriage. The company kept telling her that if she did just a little more, stayed a little longer, worked a little harder, that she would be promoted, which is why she kept pushing herself as she did. Unfortunately, Tina couldn’t balance the roles, and lost her husband as a result. She feels like a failure, and that she will always be a failure at life and at love.      Tina thought that she and Joe had many friends, but when Joe left, the friends stopped calling and coming to visit, leaving her alone with her sadness. Shortly after Joe left, she called a few girlfriends, but they eventually tired of her constant complaining and wanting sympathy and stopped answering her calls. As a result, Tina has no one to talk to. It would have been nice to talk to her sister, but her sister committed suicide four years ago after becoming deeply depressed over a broken relationship. Tina has thought about suicide too, but she isn’t at the point to do anything about it…yet.  **If you've done this paper or can assist me ( A LOT of Assistance needed) I will be more than glad to purchase pizza for you on 11/10. I've seen 2 possible "helps" on a certain website, but I am broke until then and my paper is due by midnight.**  **If you are really great and help me out today and can find the assistance I need (8-10 pages), I will reward you with the equal dollar amount in pizza... ie $25=$25 worth of pizza**  Thank you very much!  Edit: More details: Abnormal Psychology. Read Tina’s story below carefully. Using her story as a guide, write a comprehensive discussion of Major Depressive Disorder.  Use examples from her story to illustrate the important points to know about this disorder. In your discussion, be sure to include the following points:      **How it is described and diagnosed in the multiaxial system, including identifiable symptoms? (Discuss each of the five axes.)     How each theoretical perspective/approach could explain Tina’s behavior and support Tina’s diagnosis?     Which treatments would be recommended according to each theoretical perspective and the related prognosis for recovery?     Social perceptions about the disorder**   **EDIT #2- I'm done for tonight everyone. I am just amazed how many people were so sweet and kind even just wanting to help because. You are too great! Thank you all for caring, I am going to sleep. Thanks again.**	True
t3_m3r5b	1320690327.0	peternickeleater	shroom	Asking for pizza because my first one never came though. Much appreciated!	**EDIT: Please disregard this request. Tanyagal2 helped us out!**   Hey, I'm Carrie. I posted a request a few days ago. It was received really well... well enough to get an offer! I'm not entirely sure what happened, but it never was completed. The offerer and I were in contact via private message briefly, but I haven't heard back from him/her about it. I sort of feel like a jerk for telling my fiance and his kids I was getting some pizza for us. I contacted the moderators and they said it was okay to try again.  My original post was actually for my fiance. He just got laid off last week. I was hoping to get some pizza for us because he and his kids were coming over to work on his resume (he has no computer since his ancient one finally kicked the bucket). We got that all figured out and they'll be over again today so we can start emailing it to prospective employers. Money is pretty tight for me since I just paid bills and rent. If there's anyway a generous soul out there could help with dinner, we'd be so appreciative.   We're in New Castle County in Delaware.  My original post was here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/lz5pq/bummer_day_want_to_cheer_someone_up/  Happy Monday! Thanks!	True

t3_m2zih	1320630157.0	toncinap	PIF	[Offer] The Saving Abbey the Puppy Idea Contest! (Pretty Big Contest)	Alright, I will try to make this as simple as possible. I know this may look like a ploy to get you to donate to Abbey, a rescued puppy that currently has a $987 bill at my rescue's vet, but that's not all it is so don't worry ;)  HERE IS HOW THE CONTEST WILL GO. You will be entered to win one of FIVE $10 gift cards (hosted by me, not my rescue -- but I am passionate about saving animals, so it's all worth it) if you SHARE [Abbey's ChipIn](http://savingabbey.chipin.com/abbey-the-three-legged-puppy-with-parvo) and post proof here (screenie is fine), where ever you think would reach people. Twitter, Facebook, what have you. That's the easy part.  However, there are also TWO $25 gift cards up for grabs (I won one, and one I am hosting myself :) Thanks you guys!) if you can SUGGEST a fund raising tactic for ICARE to help raise money for this dog! No repeats; whoever posts a tactic first will be entered to win the $25 gift card, and the second will not. Be creative - we have a great team of intelligent people but I don't think we think of everything.  If all of Abbey's money gets raised, I may give out more giftcards. :) Why, do you ask, don't I fund the rest of Abbey's parvo treatment myself? Because they won't LET ME.  ICARE is devoted to their dogs and pay for all bills themselves, through the rescue. BUT they let me fundraise, so here I am, hoping that we can get the rest of the money. The interest rate on the loan we have with them is pretty high.  THIS CONTEST is open until the 10th of November. The contest winners will be random unless you have an especially good idea/creative share, then you will get a card. :) You may enter BOTH contests.  Happy Trails! Here's to awesome ideas about how to help this silly little three-legged puppy!  *EDIT: Contest will be extended to Saturday, the 12th due to some obligations of mine. :) Thank you for all of your wonderful support!

t3_m2u3u	1320620889.0	Cdtco	pizza-gold	[Offer] Tonight, I will E-Mail someone who has LEGITIMATE dire circumstances a pizza gift card.	I would like to give someone a pizza tonight.  HOWEVER, the person to whom I will be giving this pizza must abide by my criteria:  1.) You MUST provide proof of your circumstances. I would like to see an empty fridge, a desk full of books, a blurred-out bank account slip; anything that CLEARLY tells me that you are in a dire situation.  2.) You MUST use the verification system. Please generate a code using the verification system, and I will check it to see if your code is acceptable.  3.) You MUST have a VERY active reddit account. I don't want to see anything with little to no, or even negative karma. If you have had a reddit account for four months, I will consider sending you this pizza gift card.  4.) You MUST make the request HERE, and not by PM.  5.) After we have arranged E-Mail addresses via private messaging, and you have received the pizza, you MUST confirm that you have received the pizza. You will let me know HERE, and not by private messaging.  I hate to seem harsh, but there is a method to my madness.  I was first introduced to reddit early this summer by finding out about RAOP on CNN. I found a requestor who was local. But I figured since he was close, I could give him boxes of food that would last a while. Now, I don't mean to seem derogatory either, but it turned out that he was an 'ent' who was up to no good.  So I will thoroughly check reddit account histories.  **EDIT: 11/06/2011 6:59 PM PST (U.S.)** I have thoroughly vetted a requestor, and have fulfilled that person's request.	True

Your name must be submitted by Friday at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings Time), so that's 3pm California, 4pm Colorado, 5pm Midwest, 6pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have breathed on your own in the last 24 hours.   4) You must either reply or PM me that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ------------------------------  OK! I can't believe the number of people who entered the raffle... 73 Redditors overall!  I felt bad that the odds were so low, so I decided to do two separate drawings, One for the Domino's people and one for the Papa John's people. [HERE are the results:  Realistically1 for Domino's, and Latino_Steak_Knife for the Papa John's.](http://i.imgur.com/UHKRO.jpg) So I'll be PM'ing both of them with their winning certificate.   Also, Cincodenada asked me to pull an extra name so that he/she can add one more pizza to the party! So I sent him/her the name of the third person pulled from the combined group. Happy pizza-ing!

t3_m0dj4	1320421316.0	CharlieJohnnie	pizza	[offer] I got this Pizza Hut gift card for christmas last year, and I'm probably never gonna use it. I think I'll do a little contest thing for fun.	Here's a picture of it with the scratch-off thing intact so you knows I'm not lyin'. http://imgur.com/RaJTI  I think what I'll do is just give the card (the number on the back so you can use it to buy pizza) to whoever I choose, with extreme prejudice. I think it'll be fun.   So do this; tell me why your username is the best most cleverest username there is, and if I agree, you get it. Or I might just give it to a cute girl. But probably not because that seems unfair. Unless she's really cute. Okay guys can apply in this way too, now it's fair.   One rule though, I want you to send me a picture of you with your purchase of pizza or wings or whatever you chose.   I'll make a decision sometime this afternoon. And I'm in the U.S., I don't know if the card would be accepted in other countries, so it's probably best if we keep it to U.S. only. If I'm wrong though, foreign redditors please apply too.   **EDIT:** And just to clarify, the name doesn't have to be clever, it's the story I want to hear.   I'm very pleased with the participation so far. I will pick a winner an a couple more hours, see if I can get a few more submissions.   **Edit 2** Thank you everyone for sharing your stories, this was fun. I chose NannigarCire as the winner because I think it's creative and for the bromance and for a funny story. 	True

t3_lzv29	1320377144.0	longandshortofit	pizza	[offer] To someone who is in a bad job situation.  Unemployeed, underemployeed, or job sucks.	I feel really lucky that I just managed to get a new job that I really enjoy.  Tomorrow is my first pay day.  I'd love to give a pizza or two to someone who needs it.  Reddit please help me pick the most worthy person (good story or bad situation).  I'll get home from work around 6pm EST tomorrow (11/4) and figure out who the lucky one is.  Edit: forgot to mention, please only people with a decent length of time on reddit.  Edit^2: Thanks everyone, pizza is on the road.	True
t3_lzllb	1320362558.0	ekrommen21	PIF	[REQUEST] Thought I would try again. Get paid tomorrow. Help a girl out?	I tried yesterday with no success. Ended up just going to sleep. So yeah, I get paid tomorrow but some pizza would be most appreciated. I'm in Bellevue, WA. Will pay it forward.	True
t3_lzc3o	1320348575.0	graphicdesignmorgan	shroom	[REQUEST] It's this or peanut butter, and I'm tired of peanut butter :(.	My boyfriend and I are in a bad spot right now, and it's been a really long, hungry week. The majority of our situation is detailed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/lvgsj/request_please_help_us_keep_a_roof_over_our_heads/). Basically, we're both out of work right now, and life just kinda sucks. We've both had to drop out for the semester, missed too many classes due to not having enough gas. We're looking for full-time work, but so far the 6 temp agencies we both signed up for haven't called.   One redditor was willing to donate a very generous $150, but it won't be transfered to my bank via Paypal until Friday or Monday. Our pets have food for the moment, but their humans are very hungry! Our cabinets/fridge are basically bare, other than spices and seasoning. We used up the last of our leftovers yesterday, and now we're down to bread, peanut butter, and water. And we've had a LOT of peanut butter, bread, and water lately. I hate to ask, but we literally don't even have a dollar until that money shows up.  If anyone wanted to send us a pizza or two, that'd be amazing. Signed up for a verification code just in case ;). We'd be more than willing to send you pizza(s) back when our transfer goes through, pay it forward to some other person here in need, or provide any variety of services as part of the agreement. Also, FWIW, we're in Bonner Springs, Kansas. Have Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and Dominos/Papa Johns within pick-up distance.  Please?	True

t3_lz5pq	1320339400.0	peternickeleater	shroom	Bummer day... want to cheer someone up.	My fiance got laid off yesterday and he's kind of bummed. He just found out his grandmother was diagnosed with a later stage liver cancer. He and the kids are coming over tonight so we can update his resume. I'm pretty low on money until payday. If anyone could spare some $ for some pizza, we'd really appreciate it. We're in New Castle County, DE. Thank you!  Edit: I'm an idiot and just remembered 2 of the kids are lactose intolerant. Maybe a meatball sub or chicken fingers perhaps?	True
t3_lz2b1	1320334236.0	tangerinesky72	shroom	[request] Trying again! (With my FML week)	PIZZA WAS GIVEN TO ME BY Zeh_Valrus!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! YOU TURNED MY FML WEEK INTO A GREAT ONE(:                                                                                                                                                         Okay so here's what's up. I tried this last night, got 5 upvotes but nothing else ): any way, I'm trying one more time.. Here's my story: I requested for a pizza about 2 months ago, because of having issues finding a job after moving to Chicago IL. Truth is, I havent been on reddit much since then because I did get a job! ...Unfortunatly I got fired last week because the boss' sister wanted a job and since I was the newbie, I was the first to go... total BS! In the past week I have again only had about one thing to eat a day, like rice, mashed potatoes, and ramen because rent was just due, and my roomates don't know how to buy food. I've been fine with this until today. We now have only bread and butter left and I'm starving for some flavor in my diet. Please help me if you can. I'm sitting here with a broken cell, no cigs, no beer, no money and all my roomates are gone, like I said, FML week. Last time someone had me draw a picture on the box after I ate, I am more then willing to do something like that. I am just so hungry. (that was from yesterday, and I'm still sitting here in the same exact position, except bread and butter become less appetizing every minute)	True
t3_lz1on	1320333296.0	Liokae	pizza-gold	[REQUEST] Check is "in the mail"... but apparently not in the mail on time, Central Texas	Kitchen is bare except for some leftover cheese and a couple packs of ramen at the moment; have a check that's coming in, but is already three days late (including today; mail came in about half an hour ago).  Certainly not life or death, but been scraping by on the extremely bland for about a week now, and it'd be majorly awesome to have something that actually has taste.  I plan to pay an offer forward as soon as the check actually winds its way into my bank account.  EDIT:  Pizza provided by Pingspikette!  Thank you very much for the food!	True
t3_lyvo3	1320320995.0	chimpanzee	pizza	[CONTEST] Fluffiest cat gets a pizza!	This is another contest for a Papa John's pizza to be ordered with Papa Points. Please check that PJ's delivers to you before entering, and be aware that I will need to know your address to place the order.  ---  I will have Papa John's deliver one pizza with up to three toppings to the person who posts a picture of the **fluffiest cat** plus their **username**. The username and the cat have to be in the same picture (and the username should be *in* the picture, not photoshopped on), but the cat doesn't have to belong to the entrant - a picture of a friend's cat, or a cat at a local shelter, or a fluffy-maned lion from a nearby zoo would all be valid entries.  Entries should be submitted by noon EST on Nov. 10th, a week from today. That also happens to be my birthday, which may affect my judgement of the entries, especially if there's a tie of some sort. Just so you know. :)  ---  **Winner:** ExtraordinaryGirl! Boozer is Very Fluffy, and also shares my disdain for early Christmas stuff. ^.^	True
t3_lyiw5	1320289123.0	destinyisntfree	shroom	[Request]  Writing away for NaNoWrimo, and maybe pizza would help chip away my writer's block	**EDIT: Forgot the location, and I am in Melbourne Florida!**   So for any of you not familiar with [NaNoWriMo](www.nanowrimo.org), you should check it out.  Awesome project to get creativity flowing.   It is almost the end of the second day of the month long writing contest, the endeavor to bang out a novel in under 30 days, and I am only at 1100 words.  The goal is 50,000 in order to be considered "Complete."  I have huge writer's block.    If anyone could find it in their hearts to send me a pizza to feed my body and mind, I will find a way to work RAOP into the novel, and mention the giver in my acknowledgements when it finally goes to a publisher later in the year!    Thanks for reading and considering me for a pizza.  I know it is getting late, and with pizza places closing in an hour or so, I may not succeed, but I would be so grateful to get one!  If not today, tomorrow would be good, too, as I don't see an end in site to this brain cramp I seem to be having.	True

I found another job fairly fast so just waiting for payday. No food in fridge and no money in the bank. Would really appreciate an act of pizza! Im in Bellevue, WA.	True

I was laid off a few weeks ago, but ndb as I found a new job. Neither paid a lot, but my savings was depleted over the last few weeks while working my new job. Now I am gainfully employed, but have no cash until I get paid on Friday. I could sure use some pizza love to fill my tummy until payday.  Thanks for any help, fellow redditors.   Edit: I got a pie!

t3_lxukx	1320252755.0	dashingcr	shroom	[REQUEST]Day off, broke. Could use a pick me up in MO while I wait to see if it snows or not.	Hi there. I'm just a guy who's had a couple of good kicks from the universe lately. Today is my day off, and I just managed to finally get ahead on all of my bills as well as begin paying a lawyer for a custody case over my kid. Which is all well and good, but now I'm broke, stuck in my apartment, and have been living off cereal. Granted, it's Golden Grahams, and that's pretty much the best cereal ever, but something a little more dinner like would hit the spot. If someone feels like making a lonely single dude's day a lot brighter, I'd appreciate it a lot.   **EDIT No longer in need, won a contest!**	True
t3_lxhnv	1320220867.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] Pizza to someone at work	It's the middle of the night in the US I believe, which is an inhuman time to have to be at work. Lately I've been working weekends and 12 hour days, which means I'm tired and kind of grumpy but also richer than I used to be ;) If you're stuck at work and hungry, post a photo of you in your work gear (face must be visable), with my username written on a physical object in the photo. I'll pick someone and send them pizza.   Offer lasts until I get off work (in an hour, hour and a half I hope.)   **Edit:** I would really like to give a pizza before my brain liquifies and I turn into a zombie. I'll be here for another 20 minutes if I'm lucky and another 40 if I'm not. Offer has to expire then because after I leave work I'm going to studiously avoid all computers/words/thoughts until tomorrow morning, at which time I'll be attacked by a ninja file with stabby knives instead of pages and it will be a fight to the death and I will most likely LOSE after which they will haul my corpse off to another meeting where I'll be trapped for hours and hours with no hope of escape oh god when will it end.   So. Pizza now or forever hold your piece. And I may or may not be on a slippery slope to insanity but Australia is very far away and I can't afford the plane ticket to come stalk you/eat your brains so your info, should you win, is safe with me.  **Edit 2:** My brain has commandeered a pirate vessel complete with pirate swords and launched a hostile takeover. I think it's trying to escape my head so it never has to deal with this file ever again. I'm not sure I blame it. Anyway. I'm leaving. Goodbye, cruel world.	True
t3_lxe9t	1320211904.0	HorrendousRex	pizza	Help! I wanted to get someone an eGiftCard but it isn't sending?! She's hungry!	I'm trying to send someone a pizza as per [this post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/lx271/request_bay_area_hungry_broke/), so I bought her an eGiftCard from Dominos. The problem is that it hasn't reached her yet, and the only invoice I have from Dominos is a 'thank you for your order' email (with an order ID number) that says "We'll be sending you delivery confirmation soon, along with complete order details for your records."  The poor thing must be starving, she asked for this pizza like 5 hours ago. How can I get her her pizza? Maybe I can just buy a second pizza and ask her to send me the gift card when it arrives?  **Update:** I finally just phone-ordered another pizza, but it took trying every major online pizza company and phone-calling two local franchises to find a place that would deliver without requiring the credit card at the delivery. I think it's gonna work now. What an ordeal!	True
t3_lwr9m	1320175708.0	pookie85	FAP	Thank you to PastafarianTwit and the rest of the RAOP community.	http://snd.sc/st7U0F   Edit: I should also let you guys know that the amazing Pasta is sending me a birthday gift, which really..wow.  WOW. I'm beyond excited.  He made me become excited for my birthday again, which hasn't happened in a good few years.	True
t3_lwd71	1320152121.0	pookie85	FAP	My birthday's in four days. But this isn't a request for me.  [Request]	MUCH THANKS GOES OUT TO PastafarianTwit, for always being so incredible and for offering a helping hand. xx  Thank you very, very much.   One of my best friends lives in Massachusetts.  He's taking classes in college and I'm really proud of him for that.  He's someone I trust fully.  Which isn't easy for me to do really. But he's a great guy and I'm so glad he's in my life.  Today, he forgot to bring any food with him to school and he won't be getting home til around 6ish this evening.  That makes me feel really horrible.  I am aware that most pizza places won't be open until around 11 or so and probably don't start delivering until after 3, but I thought I'd go ahead and try my hand at getting him some food if possible.   I would do my best to help him if I lived closer, and also if I had the money. But unfortunately I do not.  I just wanted to try to help him out is all.  You're probably wondering why I'm here asking instead of him, and well, I guess it's because he doesn't know I'm doing this.  He's just a good person who is always willing to listen to me when no one else is.  You can backtrack my reddit if you want to.  I'm not ashamed to say I'm bipolar and my mood swings can be a pain to everyone.  But he doesn't give up on me.  He doesn't judge me.  He's truly one of the greatest friends I've ever had.  If I knew how to preorder a Big Mac for him, I would do my very best. But alas, I don't.  So I'm hoping maybe a redditor who knows what it's like to forget food on class day might help me help him.  Anyway, I really appreciate what's done here, and I love you all for your compassion and generosity.  xx  Edit: He's in Taunton.  If anyone can help.  Edit: He also just found out his financial aid never kicked in for college, and he's so down.  I honestly wish I could do more than what I'm attempting to do as of right now.  I just feel sort of helpless.	True

Now I'm curious about what other strange and wonderful niche genres of music might be out there. I will have Papa Johns deliver one large pizza with up to 3 toppings to the person who posts a link to the awesomest piece of music, in a genre I haven't heard before, before 5pm EST today. (Please limit it to two entries per person, ~~unless there are less than 10 by 4pm, in which case you can add a third entry each~~. I don't want to have to spend too long listening instead of getting someone their dinner.)  Fine print: I'll be using my Papa's Points to order the pizza, so I'll need to place the order myself and enter the winner's address for delivery.  ** Results **  Wow, there were some pretty good entries for this. I've narrowed it down to my favorites, and I don't think I can narrow it down any further, so I'm picking one of these randomly. My finalists are:  1. **[Hanggai - Wuji](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMrjcJpxSlo)**, entered by Realistically1  2. **[Buckwheat Zydeco - Hard To Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHlHt7Djcg0#t=81s)**, entered by this_might_be_curtis  3. **[Detektivbyrån - The Making Of "Wermland" Part 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wLWhSZ1Uvo)**, entered by 911  4. **[Consider the Source - Prophet for Profit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90z5TxW8DAE)**, entered by aleale21  5. **[Huun Huur Tu - Chiraa-Khoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bDntRWfL70)**, entered by stonedchef  And the random number generator says.... 2! Congrats, this_might_be_curtis!  **Update:** this_might_be_curtis declined the pizza, since he doesn't really need one right now. Rerolling... 4. aleale21, that's you!  **Update2:** It is surprisingly hard to give away pizza. Trying stonedchef.  **Update*3*:** Pizza has been ordered for 911.	True

t3_lvnm1	1320096893.0	hookertime	FAP	[Request] I don't have access to my bank account for the third straight week. Would appreciate a lift until the weekend	Two weeks ago I lost my debit card on a trip to Kansas City. I had enough cash to get me by for a bit, but it's run out. I still bank from my hometown (a little under 2 hours away) and I got told today that I have to pick it up from the bank. Since I work and go to school, it'll be this weekend before I can go home. I'm not broke, but I can't get to my money without my card. I bank at a local bank, so I can't just go to a branch where I currently live to get money out through a withdrawal or cashing a check. I want to pay it forward when I get access to my card, so if there's a way I can promise to do an [Offer] this weekend or next week I'll do it. I'm just sick and tired of eating cereal and sandwiches and a pizza would really boost morale to the weekend. Thanks to all of you givers out there, even if nobody can help me out tonight.

Edit: Taken care  of by fuzzysarge  Hey there everyone;  My wife broke her hand about a month ago and while it's healing up nicely it's still in a cast ( her third for this break, this newest one is more like a brace though) and that makes cooking difficult. I'm sorta useless in the kitchen myself and have exhausted my repertoire of easy to make stuff even I can't screw up. It'd be nice to have a pizza night where neither of us have to worry about cooking and can just relax together.

I had a rather lengthy contest planned but this whole weekend is pretty busy so I'll do a standard guess the number post. 1-100. I'll leave this up for a bit and check in later. I'll have to order the pizza and send it to your house, since I'm cashing in my Papa's Points to do this. Good luck!  **Edit: Sorry for waiting so long to draw, my night got kind of awesome. The winning number was 41, so pm me comeonnowbro and we'll get this set up.**	True

t3_ltj5k	1319923837.0	badbrownie	brownie	[Offer] Credit Card debt just earned you a pizza!	**[EDIT2] Sorry this is taking a while.  I've gone through the posts and as best I can tell Toncinap has out-proved everyone for credit card debt.  It's not as high a number as some other debts but it seems to be the largest proved credit card debt.  So - I'm buying Toncnap a pizza but if there's anyone else on this thread already that can send my documentation of more than 10k of Credit Card debt (no medical bills or student loans unless you've transferred them to your credit card) then you'll get a pizza too!**  **[EDIT: Contest closed.  This is going to be a little harder to work out than I thought.  A lot of the pics are unclear as to what kind of debt they are.  I'm stepping out for a few hours but will go through all the pics and announce winners.]**  I don't care if it's because you're a shopaholic or because you've got medical bills.  The 2 biggest credit card debts get pizza!  If your debt is spread out across multiple cards then cumulative debt still counts!  BUT - I'm only counting "verifiable" debt issues!   Please post the amount of your debt in your post in this thread so people know what they have to beat.  I'll feed the 2 or 3 most financially challenged folks/family with large pizzas!  You don't need to post proof here, but you need to be able to PM it to me.    Remember: it doesn't count if you can't prove it.  Your PM should just be explanatory text around a link to your evidence.  If you're a family, then please post a pic of the family too with  a drawing of a pizza so I know how many people will be eating.	True

t3_lra4v	1319742763.0	debotehzombie	PIF	[REQUEST] 3 time giver/1 time gifted needs lunch	Good afternoon, RAOP! I'm a 3 time giver on here after I won a contest and won pizza (that I didn't NEED at the time, as I had food to eat, but it was apreciated), but now I am in need of a nice pizza. Due to a complete oversight on my part, I overdrafted my bank account after helping pay for prescriptions for my girlfriend's mom, so now I am -$27 (and some change) until help arrives in the form of a check from my grandparents at the beginning of the month. The only food we have are food items that need to be saved for dinner (a whole chicken, family size lasagna, and the like), so I can't just snack for the rest of the month. If you would like to help my girlfriend and myself, I would definitely pay it forward with any extra money my grandparents include (if they do so). Thank you for listening to my sob story, everyone, and have a great day.  EDIT: If you're in doubt as to my giver status, I will update with a link when I'm back home, but for now just search my name on the subreddit. I have one thread about my giving, as the others stopped responding after they said they were enjoying the pizza (one stopped after saying they'd get the pizza tomorrow). Also I have proof of my bank overdraw. If any potential giver is skeptical of my plight, just PM me and I will prove myself. Thank you.	True

Conditions:  1. *They* must agree to accept said pizza, either on the thread or via PM to me, and take a picture of the pizza.  2. *You* must make a compelling reason for me to send them pizza.  Not necessarily a sob story, but a good reason.  3. I will be a snoop and ensure that accounts are active, not brand new, and don't sniff of spammer.  I will also ask for a verification code.  US only (sorry, guys) and I'll send it via an e-card from either Pizza Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.    IMPORTANT EDIT:  I will keep this open until 4pm Pacific Time.  Then, I will draw names of all eligible entries out of a hat to ensure that it's random and fair.    EDIT 2: WHO DOWN VOTES THIS?!  May your pizza always arrive cold and congealed...

Now because another resident found out what he has a felony for and reported it to the corporate office we now have to be out on the 31st.  We've been here less than a month.  With bills getting in the way we have no money for food.  I made the last of our food last night.

It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able. I'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!  Hello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.  I have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.  I've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.  Also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.  So here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.  NOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)  EDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.  	True
t3_lm8af	1319395543.0	Nyrvana	shroom	(Request) Sick and tired of being Sick and tired	A few months back I found out I had Lupus and RA.  It hasn't been easy but you do what ya gotta do.  I am now to the point of "sick of being sick and tired" all the time. If anyone could perk up my day I would humbly appreciate it! Location: Oklahoma	True
t3_lm3j1	1319386363.0	TheGoodEarth	shroom	This place is amazing. Thank you to all the givers.	As a reader of Reddit for six months or so and a "member" for less than a month, I have to say what a wonderful community this is and how thankful I am to ALL those who contribute to it.  Like many others, I entered the working force at age 15 and have yet to be unemployed until this past Friday. I worked for a local bank, but then it expanded. I moved to another "local" bank last year with promises of opportunities for growth and security. I was laid off on Friday. It's the plight of 31 million other Americans. We study and we work and we save and then shit happens. I can sit here all day and blame others and even myself, but shit happens. We're given ample opportunity to thrive here, and we even have safety nets that others just aren't ever afforded, but we are given more than plenty of chances to sink or swim.   And now, I enter the unemployed population more scared than I'd like to admit. Scared of failure, scared that I won't be able to provide for my family, scared I'll drown in a pool of my own debt and scared I'll become a number that we consider the "greedy lazy looking for handouts."  My fears are comforted though. Comforted by those who have been where I am and now have success stories. I also find comfort in knowing my fate if I give in to feeling sorry for myself and my situation. The comfort I found most recently was those so readily willing, for whatever their reason, to help complete strangers. There are a thousand adjectives that don't do this kind acts justice. It leaves me speechless and brings tears to a grown man's eyes.  There's really no point to this post other than it being another "thank you" to everyone that contributes here. Not just the givers, but those that offer sympathetic words of support and encouragement and those that "pay it forward" be it in pizza or some other random act.  Matt_and_Chelle reached out yesterday offering to help us with "staples" next week and are even making room for us at their upcoming yard sale. iRedditAlot provided us with a very generous gift card to a local pizza shop. Not in a million years would I have ever expected this. The gestures themselves, getting pantry items and food, are things we don't think much about at the time. The fact that others think to do things like that is the true "act of kindness" that "restores one's faith in humanity."  Thank you to every single one of you.

t3_lltxp	1319353486.0	badbrownie	brownie	[Offer] Thanks for the Thanks!	This offer for a $25 pizza gift card goes out to all past receivers who've brightened this sub-reddit with the sweetness of your Thank You posts.  It's a simple contest that works like this:  * You comment here with a link to a submission of Thanks you've made in the past.  The thanks must have been its own post though, rather than just a comment (and it must be in the past.  ie, before this post)  There, that's it.  However, there's a twist to the winner-selection process.  It will be raffle-style where you get 'tickets' for the draw as follows:  * one ticket for a text post * two tickets for a post including a picture of the pizza * 3 tickets for a post with a pic of you (either enjoying the pie or just with thumbs up or whatever).  Pics with masks DO qualify (you know who you are you superhero, you). * 4 tickets for a post with a video thanks (I only remember seeing one of these but it truly moved me).  AND...if you've received multiple pizzas and made multiple thank you posts then you can enter multiple times and have more chances to win.  This is just a Thank You to all the 'receivers' that make giving so rewarding!  The draw will be made sometime Monday evening (west coast time)   **[EDIT: Ok, I think we have enough contestants.  Here's the plan: I'm going to use the random number generator on my command line to do the 'drawing'.  Will get back to you with a winner soon**   **[EDIT 2]  Ok, here're your ticket numbers:**  medusa010:  1-4  hawkeyepeers: 5-13  srhk24: 14-15  rwheeler720: 16-17  razzmatazz1313: 18-19  beachpatty: 20-22  hello_mellow: 23-25  jenners: 26-28  Defiledxhalo: 29-31  kristekitty: 32-35  Madmortigan: 36-40  OneCrookedVulture: 41  pookie85: 42-43  d46ron1337: 44-45  beachpatty: 46-47  Now all I have to do is go to the command line on my mac and type this:  echo $[RANDOM%47+1]  and the winning ticket number will come up.    **[EDIT3] WE HAVE A WINNING TICKET NUMBER:  Will the owner of Ticket number 31 please step forward to claim your prize!  Please send me a [verification code](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/) and your choice of PapaJohns/Dominos/PizzaHut and your email address and a gift card will be coming out to you.**	True

t3_ll74n	1319307390.0	badbrownie	brownie	[Contest] Halloween Costume Time (part 1)! (all pizza givers vote on the winner)	**EDIT: Voting Canceled.  Everyone Wins!**  Post a pic of you in your Halloween costume.  Yes it's early but this contest will benefit the prepared.  You must be holding a drawing of a pizza to verify it's this years costume and that it's you.  Entries can keep on coming till the winner is awarded but the judging begins tomorrow evening (let's say after 2pm PDT).  The judging will be done by any user with a pizza icon (giver) or a custom icon (repeat giver).   Just add a comment on the sub-thread of the pic you like best and that will count as a vote.  Upvoting the pic won't count for obvious reasons.  The votes will be tallied on Monday at 3pm PDT and it's Monday evening pizza for the winner.  **[EDIT]considering the wise words of JetBoyTerp, let's say that this contest requires at least 5 entrants before it's complete.  So it may end up going longer than tomorrow...**  **[EDIT2]  Ok - me and the mrs and the kid couldn't agree.  Lucas voted for the ghoul, the wife voted for Osama Banana and I couldn't get my head around the madness that is a horse riding a horse.

Here's some clues so you'll know your judges  * Lucas The Bloodthirsty likes war movies * Luz hates war movies and likes the chickiest chick flicks you ever saw.  The Hallmark channel has a picture of my wife in their "creative lounge" and every day they say "Make another movie for Her!" * I like time-travel movies.  Damn, I've seen some nonsense because it promises me time-travel.  I once watched a christian movie about the end days from beginning to end because I came across it in Blockbuster with a time machine on the cover.  I complained about it and mocked it the whole way through but when the mrs told me to turn it off I said "I can't!  It's got time-travel in it".  :(  We'll announce the winner at 10am PDT on Sunday (tomorrow)  [EDIT: Sorry I thought this contest was finishing on Monday!!  Ok - better late than never.

t3_ll3lr	1319300687.0	scuatgium	pizza	[OFFER] The Begining	So I have discussed this with a friend of mine since finding RAoP and I have decided to implement it this weekend. Since I am sitting in my local pizzeria waiting on a pie, I thought now was the best time to follow through with my plan.  So, RAoP, I want to give away pizza to one person each day of the weekend who I decide needs it. I really have not come up with any criteria as to who gets the pizza, but I think I will know when I read the comments based off of need. If it be the starving college student, the family in need, or someone who says something worthwhile, then they get pizza through a a gift card, delivery, etc.  I plan on doing this every weekend for as long as I can. This is my first time, so forgive me if I take my time making sure I do it correctly.  I have something planned for December, but I'll wait to make that announcement when the time comes. Until then, tell me why you need pizza!  Edit: I have chosen someone for today. Awaiting their pm to give them pizza.  Edit 2: WOOT! Card delivered, this feels so good! Thank you reddit for this awesome idea.  Edit 3: Till tomorrow folks!	True

I don't want to hear sad stories so post things that make you laugh, stories, pictures, whatever. I'll send e gift cards to whatever I find the funniest when I get up and into the evening. I'm in California and working nights so it'll be around 3pm pst when I get up.  **Edit** Alright, just woke up, going through the posts right now. Also, it's not that I think that nobody cares about me, just a few people that have recently let me down, or are in the process of letting me down.  **Edit2** Just picked the first few to get pizzas. I will probably give out 1 or 2 more later tonight, I just have to go get some food for myself.  **Edit3** Alright, hopefully I haven't promised more pizzas than I can afford. If I have, well, I might be requesting some in a week or two. As long as everyone gets back to me, that will be it. Thanks for the funny stories and videos.	True

I would appreciate pizza for lunch today. I didn't pack anything to eat for lunch, ran out of the apartment late , since I didn't plan ahead in case of lateness, I didn't have time to eat a breakfast because being late to my job could cost me my job....and I live an hour away from where I work. I get off from work at 4:30. I am really, really hungry. And, in the interest of proving  where I live to prove what happened.....there is only one bus from the city I live in to Reno in the morning that will enable me to be on time to work. I also have to walk a mile from the bus stop to my job to be on time. If I miss the bus....I'm late. Unless I pay $75 for a cab.  www.rtcwashoe.com check the RTCIntercity Schedule. I have to be to work by 8. I have to leave my apartment no later than 6:53 to make it to the bus stop on time. My alarm didn't go off and I woke up at 6:39 instead of 6:00am. Hence the running out the door. My fault....but I'm willing to admit it.  Thank you.	True

t3_lhrdu	1319049594.0	72hours	shroom	[REQUEST](Now with more Manners!)Day off, still no real food for a couple of days. Would appreciate a pie. (MO)	First of all, thanks for even clicking the link and reading this. I hope its okay to repost so soon, but my last request went unnoticed except for a scolding by allioops for my lack of manners, and frankly, she was right to do so. But basically, like the title says, its my day off, and I'm out of real food, Ramen and rice are ok, but they get a little old. Its a cold, gloomy day, and I've kind of been sleeping just to avoid the reality of my cupboards lol. If someone would please be kind enough to hook me up with a pizza, I would greatly appreciate it. I usually wait for contests, but the last one I though I won in never panned out for me. I still don't understand why someone would enjoy doing that to people, but that's life. Thanks for reading, and have a good one.	True

t3_lhdia	1319023099.0	p_i_z_z_a	shroom	Veteran in Detroit in need of some food.	I'm 23 and I'm back in college. I served from 2007 to 2011 in the U.S. Army. I am surviving solely on military benefits now. Unfortunately, coming home from the military comes with many bills. While I will be receiving funds in November, I am utterly broke until then. The savings I had has been completely spent due to purchasing a vehicle, furnishing an apartment (as minimally as possible), and groceries that have lasted me until now (well, a couple days ago). I haven't eaten a single thing since Sunday.  When November rolls around, I promise to return the favor to someone else on reddit in need. I will literally be living off water until then though. Thank you so much, reddit, for this wonderful opportunity and service to reach out to.  **Edit 1:** I'm sorry, but I do not understand how to properly do a request in this subreddit. I see other posts have [Request] in front of their titles, but mine does not. This is a request, however.  **Edit 2:** As requested, here's verification that I am indeed a veteran: http://imgur.com/a/vmv5j  **Edit 3:** It's done! Thanks so much to "m2mu" for the pizza! Upvotes for everybody! Even for the people I disagreed with! Thanks, RAOP! I will definitely pay it forward in November :D I'll use this throwaway to do it with too!	True

(MO)	Hey RAOP, I hate to post a request, I usually try to just get in on contests and random giveaways, but I'm not sure what I'm going to eat besides rice and ramen for the next couple of days, so I figured Id give this a try. If someone would be gracious enough to please hook me up with a pie, I'd really appreciate it. I lurk here enough to know my odds aren't the best, but I may luck out. Thanks for giving this request a look.	True

But I am glad you did!  I literally devoured an entire pizza, and your post and generousity really inspired me.  Post went something like this!  I just read garbage on "ASSISTANCE" and I need to give away pizza ASAP.    She said she would give pizza to the first 3 who responded, I responded fourth and she gave me a pizza calling it a "tie".    SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE ANOTHER PIZZA TO THE FIFTH PERSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   You are an absolute guardian angel, I am very sorry I did not post picture - I have no means to do so.

t3_lfob1	1318893620.0	Grwl	shroom	[REQUEST] hey RAOP, I thought it'd be cool to get some random pizza. DFW, TX	Just checking this out, I've been consumed by Reddit recently and am now branching out into the subreddits (does this count as one? lol Im new to all of this).   Not really a sob story but hey Ill tell you whats up in my life right now. I live with my gf of 4 years in a modest apartment in some suburb in between Dallas and Fort Worth. In May I was laid off by Best Buy when they closed the facility I was working in and moved it to Kentucky. I have been on unemployment since and have been finding it a might difficult to find a job that will allow me to pay my current bills better than unemployment can. I've gone to college on and off since graduating high school in 03 (if you had asked me then if id be be a college-dropout on unemployment 8 years later...I would've called you nuts) I suppose this is how life goes.   I'm not sure if this is too long of a post for this and I apologize if it is!  if I don't end up getting pizza, that's all good.. I understand that there may be someone in a more grave situation and by all means I would love for them to get it before I.   EDIT: OH! I'm an artist so I would be willing to draw any random thing for free pizza (dont expect it to be like mind-blowingly amazing but I will definitely try to make it cool!) if interest is shown in that avenue, I can link to my photobucket to show my style and see if there is still an interest. thanks all!

t3_lfmd8	1318890351.0	rwheeler720	FAP	[request] i got fired today, AND our car got towed.	So this past month has been incredibly shitty. My job has been treating my like shit, and I've been trying to transfer out, but I'm sure some of you know how restaurants can be... Well the other night they crossed the line. I had a coworker drive me home, and I was crying because of the shitty night I had and the shitty way management treated me and after he dropped me off, he called my manager and told her I told him I was going to kill myself. They called the cops, cops came to my house to make sure I wasn't dead, or going to kill myself. When I didn't answer right away, they yelled "MISS, ARE YOU IN THERE? ARE YOU OKAY? ARE YOU ALIVE? DO YOU NEED HELP? HAVE YOU HURT YOURSELF?" I was just trying to put on some pants because its was 1 fucking AM. I was mortified, and my neighbors asked questions the next day. (The cops got here at 1AM, and as you guys know, cops aren't quiet.)   I made a big deal out of it at work and they came up with an excuse to fire me.   http://imgur.com/XFvWq **PROOF**  Also, when I got home today from my meeting with the manager where they formally fired me, I discovered the car was towed for illegal parking. It was parked across two spaces in the back of the apartment complex parking lot so my boyfriend could fix it (water pump busted). Of course, when he left it, the car wasn't altogether, so we're pretty sure pieces fell out along the way to the "towing place". They're asking for $125 just to get the car out, and towing back to our complex is extra. The past month has been fucked, but the past three days have been especially fucked. Due to my food stamps being cut back from $200 a month to $31 a month, we have 3 days worth of food left in the house, and since I got fired, and my boyfriend is unemployed, we have no money coming in. A pizza would really help, as it could feed us for two days. And put a smile on my face. I can't stop crying. :'/  **TL;DR: I got fired, car got towed, can't stop crying (I'm such a girl) and need something-ANYTHING to make me smile, and fill our tummies tonight. Please help?**  *Edit: to remove my last name from the post*  Edit2: CUTIEJUDY said my pizza will be here in 45 mins. Thank you so much. :)	True

EDIT: There was a change of plans and I am leaving tonight, so I no longer need a pizza. I'll just eat when I get home.   I posted yesterday under r/randomactsofpizza yesterday because I didn't know about this one before hand  I'm over in Port Orchard, WA dog sitting for some people, and I was under the impression they were going to leave me some food to eat. They aren't coming back until very late tonight and until then I don't have many options until they pay me.  What I can offer is a picture of me, the dog, and the pizza as soon as I get home on Tuesday.  A pepperoni pizza would be a great lunch and dinner for me, and I would really appreciate one.

t3_lf682	1318864224.0	badbrownie	brownie	Gotcha, you scamming scumbag.  That's one trick that won't work on me again.	I got man-in-the-middle scammed.  Someone trying to take advantage of northernInfinity's plight and snag their pizza signed up as a redditor called northemInfinity and it slipped past me.  I sent the scumbag a $25 gift certificate for papajohns.  Luckily it all happened after Dominos was closed and I got to them before the giftcode was used.   So - now it won't work and there's another trick that I won't fall for again.    Of course, shame on me for falling for the top most scam mentioned on the Don't Fall For Scams page.  But I win this round - in the end.  EDIT:  For fun, this is the email I sent to the giftcard people...  Hi,  I got scammed by someone and sent this giftcard to the wrong person.  Take a moment and see if you can appreciate how annoying this is and help me stop the thieving little bastard from getting away with it.    I'm a part of the Reddit community called Random_acts_of_pizza.  You can find it here  www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza  It's a lovely little community that gives away pizzas to people.  Sometimes because they need them and sometimes just for fun.  I myself have purchased about 15 $25 gift certificates from you guys.  In fact, I only ever give away PapaJohns/Dominos/PizzaHut pizza because I can just give them your eGiftCard.  Check xxxxxxx@xxxxx.com as one of your regular customers.  So - this guy made a post and I offered him a pizza:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/leogq/request_havent_eaten_in_36_hours_got_six_bucks_in/  So (if you can go to the link) you'll see that I told him to send me a message with his email and preference of pizza and that I'd send him a gift card.  That's when the scammer stepped in.  He created a new account with a username Very Similar to the person making the post and he sent me a private message with that email address in the hope that I wouldn't notice the difference in the username and that I'd send Him the gift card instead of the needy person.  What an utter ass, eh?  Well, it worked! :(    I Did send him the gift card.  THIS gift card.  And now I'm hoping that you'll rescind it and foil his evil plan.  Maybe give me a new gift card number as a replacement that I can donate to someone worthy.  If you do this then I'll be sure to mention how you helped foil this nasty little thief.  But here's the thing.  He may have already spent it (in which case I'm screwed).  But if he hasn't then he's likely to spend it very soon.  So - if he hasn't spent it yet, please cancel it so that I can give it to someone worthy.  Thank you! 	True

I have a slow leak on one of my tires that I have to fill about every 3 days, so all my quarters are gone.  I sleep in the laundry/office room of a close friend nice enough to take me in. Though, he says ill have to move out soon. I was lucky to be able to fit my bed in here. That, my car, and this laptop are about all I have. I have decided tomorrow to use my last 2 bucks on gas so I can go by the local fast food and gas stations to apply for work.

Goddamnit.  Anyway, the first thing that popped into my mind, of course, was "REDDIT," and getting back to my room, the first thing I do is jump onto my computer and go right to RAoP. Now, I'm sitting here, pretty damn hungry, listening to Ensiferum and wondering what I can do to get some delicious pizza in my belly. So here's my offer. I am willing to provide a custom funny drawing of the giver's choice in exchange for a pizza. I'm not looking for anything extravagant as far as the pizza goes, and we have a cheap local place that delivers until midnight. In exchange for said pizza, you receive said drawing. The only other food I have right now is Martin's Salt and Vinegar potato chips, and while they are delicious, they simply aren't much of a meal. Please help this broke sophomore get himself some 'zza?  Help me Random Acts of Pizza, you're my only hope!  EDIT: ANARCHYREIGNS, YOU ROCK! Thanks for the pizza!  EDIT #2: Here's the picture, as promised: http://i.imgur.com/X7Koz.jpg	True
t3_lcoa8	1318638328.0	Schpsych	shroom	{Request} AmeriCorps service member in need of pizza relief in Toledo, OH.	Alright...so, I'll try to keep it brief, not sure if I'm doing this right...I'm a grad student studying school psychology, I work as a fitness coach training the elderly to stay limber and healthy, I mentor, and I am currently working as a AmeriCorps member with United Way going out and meeting with parents and community members discussing how to get them more involved in their school.  On the weekends, I volunteer at an organic CSA farm and I'm getting getting ready to get married next summer.    Man, long story short reddit, I never eat out, but I just finished giving this brainiac an IQ test that took 3 hours and I would REALLY love to have some pizza...I'm broke (make less than minimum wage when my 2 "jobs" are averaged out) otherwise I'd just buy it myself.    I have beer, but no pizza.  I'm not gonna go hungry but...I've been up since 4:00 a.m. and I really need a pizza.  If I get a pizza I'll plant something for you at the farm :)  Thanks for your consideration!	True

t3_lchh9	1318625650.0	darkmagician1983	shroom	{request} Nothing until Sunday, but need something now. I live in Idaho.	Do yourself a favor, don't major in communications. In three years my best job was turning dials at an old radio station. The kind where they cut off late at night and restart in the morning. So my worthless major stays off most of my resumes because it's doing more harm than good at this point. I flaked my way through college and now I'm working 20 hours a week bagging groceries. My coworkers are ten years younger than me or thirty years older than me, it's embarrassing.  So anyway, food pantry doesn't open until 10 on Sunday, I got tap water until then. Any chance anyone could buy me some dinner? I'm watching what little TV I can get on these rabbit ears and could use something to tide me over today and tomorrow. Any help would  be great.  Ryver is offering to buy me dinner tonight, this site works like a charm, thanks everyone =)	True

Oh, and for your listening pleasure, please listen to the following:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK8RQZclSns&feature=fvst  Now, here's the situation, dears.  I just came from having lunch with my twisted sista, and she seems really, really sincere about burying the hatchet  (she promises this time not in my back) and being there for each other, you know, soul sisters, I've got your back, "defying gravity," yada, yada, and so on and so forth...BTW, lunch was devine.  The munchkins fixed this salad that....oh, sorry to digress. Oh, which brings me to "Condition Number 1":  You must have an  abundance of patience for this offer and "Condition Number 2":  You must be able to personally pick up your za from Dominos.  Anyway, as I was saying ad naseum, she wants us to be friends again.   Please listen to the video 'cause it will help explain everything.  Anyway, dear people:  What say you?  Does she deserve another chance?  Should I trust her "yet again"?  Tell me in 50 words or less what you believe her message is, not only to me, but to humanity, in general.  Now you wonder why you need patience?  Well, I was cleaning out my pink bubble last night and happened upon 8  --you read that right -- Dominos codes anywhere from .49 on up totaling over $25.00.  So, those who submit responses to my query will have to be very "patient" while the cashier at Dominos rings in 8 different coupon codes; but the reward is a feast, I say!!

t3_lbm72	1318561216.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] Pizza on behalf of the lovely toncinap and the very hardcore sierraechowhiskey	Here's the history:  * I made an offer [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/l3jhj/offer_for_a_martial_artist/) which sierraechowhiskey won, with details provided in a PM. (Trust me, he's hardcore.)  * Sierraechowhiskey generously asked me to offer his pizza to someone that I can help, instead of accepting it for himself. I told him there'd be a slight delay since I'd spent all my money, and he was ok with that.  * I won a pizza off the very lovely toncinap [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/l8zqy/offer_my_husband_loves_my_little_pony_the_new/), who was kind enough to let me pass it on to sierraechowhiskey, who asked me to pass it on to a hungry redditor, which toncinap agreed to.  So! After that very long history, I'm making an offer to:  1. someone who is hungry and who can't easily justify spending the money on a pizza treat (you don't need to broke, but if you can easily afford it, celebrate your good fortune by buying yourself a pizza!); and also  2. has the coolest* comment history.  I'll keep this up for a day or so; e-card will be collected off me or toncinap. Probably toncinap.  Go! :)  *this may mean dorkiest or funniest or nicest or most interesting or something else as yet to be determined	True

Tonight they are going out of town to visit their kids at college and I'm on my own for food. Problem, they haven't gone shopping for a while, and I could make a provolone cheese sandwich...

t3_lariz	1318510411.0	Binerexis	pizza	[OFFER] Pizza for long-haired bearded folk	Greetings people of RaoP! This offer is due to something that happened to me the other day.   I'm a guy who has shoulder length hair and a long goatee. Whilst I was out celebrating my friend's engagement, he told me that his sister-in-law has a *thing* about guys with long hair and beards. For some reason, she gets freaked out by them, thinks they're freaks and all the rest of it. This is seriously not cool. So seriously not cool that I'm spreading some long-hair beard love to you guys.   All you have to do is post a picture of your long-haired bearded self holding a sign with your reddit username and the date in the format DD/MM/YY(YY) and then I'll get things underway to get you your pizza. The gentlemen with the most epic hair/beard combo wins it (basically if you have extremely long hair and a Pai Mei beard then you definitely win).  **IMPORTANT:** I live in England so if you're American, you **MUST** tell me what pizza place you want a coupon for out of Domino's, Papa John's and Pizza Hut. If you happen to live in England, I'll be using the Domino's site as the default for ordering online which requires you to give me some more personal info but I won't be holding onto it or anything. If you happen to have a different/better pizza place near you with an online pay/delivery thing with deals then I'll look into that too but please only online secure stuff.   **EDIT:** Ok, it looks like I can't use my card for American ordering. This leaves me with only being able to give to English recipients at the moment until someone can give me a work around or can check if one of the listed chains will take payment from PayPal or something.   **EDIT2:** My mortal enemies,the Beardless Brigade, seem to have downvoted this because they are beardless and suck.   **EDIT3:** Pizza was received and was delicious.

Not too sure how the whole process of actually giving away a pizza goes, but I figured I would give it a shot and hope that IRL karma grants me a pizza. I would use these gift codes myself but Domino's doesn't deliver to my college, and it would be too much of a hassle to find a way to secure a pizza to my bike. The quickest, best-reasoned responses get the pizza.  Edit: Proof pics, and ye shall recieve (i.e., post pics for added legitimacy so that I'm more likely to give pizza to you!) Edit2: I'm also going to be more likely to give pizzas to people who haven't gotten any in the past, so yeah.  Edit3: Both pizzas sent out!	True
t3_l6eu5	1318199734.0	monkeyhihi	FAP	[REQUEST] Haven't eaten all day; my wallet was stolen friday (Atlanta, GA)	So on friday, my wallet was stolen. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until yesterday evening, as I thought I had simply left my wallet in my dorm room (I didn't). My roommate's wallet was stolen too unfortunately, but he was lucky enough to have his school ID outside of his wallet. I would get another ID so I could go to the cafeteria, but with my luck, the office to get new ID's is only open from M-F. I've had to cancel my debit cards so I could get replacements, so unfortunately ordering a pizza online (where my CC# would be stored) is out of the question.  So I ask, could you guys help a hungry redditor (with low karma <_<) out?  Edit: I discovered I have enough Papa John's points to get a free pizza from them. Only problem is that I have no credit card to pay the delivery fee. Crap.	True
t3_l6bt2	1318193604.0	Matt_and_Chelle	FAP	[REQUEST] We humbly ask for your help for NOT pizza that is NOT for us. 	**Glinda the bitchin-ist witch in the world helps our friends out. Thanks RAOP!**  We know we haven't been a part of the RAOP community for a long time, but I'm reaching out hoping someone can help our neighbors. I know I'm about to ask for a lot, but it's worth a shot. I know you guys rock.  I'll try to keep the sob story short-- Within the past month, they've dealt with a hefty Roto-Rooter bill, a blown up motor in the car, a death in the family, and a brand new baby. They're great people who have had some shitty luck (the baby isn't shitty luck, but it just adds to the commotion) come their way. They don't have any family in the area that isn't as old as the pyramids. We're helping them with their car, but that's all we can do for the time being. We're totally tapped out which is why I come to you all.  I know this is Random Acts of *pizza,* but the problem is pizza won't work for them. The wife/mom and the oldest can't have tomatoes (they have a reaction of sorts. I don't know if it's a true allergy, but they get an outbreak that is or may be eczema) and the now-middle child can't eat cheese (lactose intolerance). I was thinking subs or steaks, or Chinese, or whatever.   We all know people in shitty situations so I know this is a lot to ask. These neighbors were the first to greet us when we moved here.They've done a lot for us. We even spent one Thanksgiving with them. I've got a list of local places if anyone can help. Thanks!!!  **TL. DR   Our friends need not-pizza.**  I don't know if it will help as an incentive, but we'll be able to offer some pizza (or give you a pizza back) later this week after we get paid. 	True
t3_l5quu	1318135249.0	jofus_joefucker	shroom	[request] Some fellow redditors have been very helpful in trying to get me a pizza, but we keep running into a snag :(	So yesterday Darahen2004 was generous enough to send me a $10 egift card to pizza hut, but since they require a print out of the egift card, I can't use it because I don't have a printer. So I posted a message to see if maybe somebody could help us use card and get some pizza my way....  Alli0ops was kind enough to try and get me some pizza last night, but sadly they were no longer taking any more orders online for delivery, so we figured we would try again tonight. Unfortunately we couldn't get it to work because of the international stuff :(   I am located in Mountlake Terrace, Washington, and was just wanting to know if there might be anyone else who might be able to help get some hot food sent my way!   Thank you very much :D  *edit* I will give you the code for the pizza hut card so that it gets used as it was intended.	True

t3_l598j	1318096827.0	richgiverguy	pizza	[Offer] I forgot about this site and "randomly" remembered it	I haven't been here in a while, but my exploring of the internet somehow got me to Reddit.com and I remebered this subreddit. I decided I'll make an offer.   I don'twant you to make me something, or waste your time with any of that bullshit because frankly, I don't wanna see any of it. But, I do believe in hard work, and not in people asking for handouts. I didn't get to where I am today by begging. You need to grab the bull by the tail and fuck it hard!!! Take charge!!!  Anyway...  I will give 5 pizzas, maybe more today. Just write something random and I'll give you a pizza.   edit: I have 2 ppl so far, gonna order, rest a little, then pick more  edit: I have 5 people!! 	True

A pizza goes to you my friend!]  He's the judge of this one.  He's just turned 7 and he likes Beyblades (don't ask) and Lego.  He also wants me to mention that he likes guns (!!) and video games.  Please submit a pic that is taken specially for this contest so it should have the word "Lucas" somewhere in the pic (and not added after the pic is taken).  Other than that it's all up to him!   We'll be awarding this one around 4 or 5pm PDT today providing we've got at least 5 contestants to choose from.  Otherwise this contest may drag out till tomorrow.	True
t3_l546z	1318084559.0	badbrownie	brownie	[OFFER] Pizza for the tallest girl and the shortest guy	**[EDIT2: Well, hilariously, I've only had ONE real contestant!  One pic taken in a doorway for the purposes of this contest.  rwheeler720 is a worthy winner at 6'1" and I think many of us were pulling for her as soon as we saw the pic of her with the fella.  Tall AND beautiful is always enchanting in a girl.**  **But in the 'shortest fella' contest 7'0" Dashuhn would have won if he'd thought to submit an entry.  All that was needed was a pic in a doorway to be a part of it.  Telling me that you're prepared to submit a pic if I ping you to let you know you'd won just made me chuckle.  So, the guys contest is canceled and I'll open up a new contest today instead]**   [EDIT: This pic will run till at least 10am PDT on Sunday 10/9.  Also, it would be nice to verify the pic is you that it include a drawing of a pizza in the pic (so I know it wasn't culled from google.  ikaite is exempt as it got introduced after she entered.]  The title says it all.  This one goes out to the gals who get asked what the weather is like up there and the guys who got picked last at basketball.  The guy pic has to be of someone at least 18 years old for obvious reasons.  Here's what I'm looking for as proof.  A pic of you in a doorway with no shoes on.  The pic should show that you're not wearing shoes or standing on anything and the top of the doorway should be visible.  I'll lean toward assuming that all doorways are the same size, but I reserve the right to doubt you if the perspective doesn't look right.    Photoshopped pics will be named and shamed!	True

People I love to feed are any/some/all of the following  * Demonstrably needy (photo evidence helps) * Redditors for more than a day! * Good people * Teenagers or Seniors   I can be a bit of a pain regarding satisfying myself that I'm not getting scammed and if my requests for evidence seem unreasonable, I apologize in advance.

t3_l4cn0	1318010751.0	Ignem	pizza	[Offer] Couple's night out.	Happy Friday, RAoP! The GF and I were talking about how important it is for couples to have an occasional "date night," and decided we'd try and provide some semblance of a date for a couple that needs one.  We were thinking an e-giftcard for some pizza, and we also have a couple of codes that can be redeemed on Fandango for free movie tickets.    Leave a post, tell us why you and your SO need a date night, and around noon central tomorrow, we'll pick a lucky couple for a Saturday night out.    We'd like it to be someone who's been a Redditor for at least a month, and standard verification stuff applies.  I think the Fandango codes are US only, so we'll probably want to limit it in that regard as well.  If you'd like to leave a picture if you two on your date, that's great too!  Thanks!  edit:  GF just couldn't decide on one couple, so we're going to give away two date nights tonight.  Congrats to busymommy83 and hawkeyepeers!	True

We've redone the website [www.randomactsofpizza.com](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com).    Lots of new people were having trouble learning the Reddit site, so now [www.randomactsofpizza.com](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com) is geared as an entry point into Reddit.  It has links to all the important stuff for all of us old hands (like verification) and instructions for all the newbs.  The site is still beta and we'd appreciate it if people would look it over and suggest any wording changes or point out grammar and spelling errors.  All of the mods have gone over it and we will be tweaking it some more over the next couple of days.  We'd also like some community suggestions.    We will be getting some more media attention soon and we'd like to emphasize the community nature of RAOP and the ethos of giving and "Pizza It Forward" that we've all developed.  Any ideas on how to best educate new members is especially appreciated.  Please feel free to include text suggestions that we can add to the site.  As part of the new web design we have a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/random_pizza) account and a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/randomactsofpizza) page.  New Reddit threads are auto-posted to both.   Thanks to [Craig Morrison](http://www.craigmorrison.ca/) aka [seamore555](http://www.reddit.com/user/seamore555) for the webpage design and twitter and Facebook integration.

It is pretty easy to find my real life name when searching for Random Acts of Pizza.  I'm proud and humbled that my real life identity is tied to such a great group of people!	True

t3_l1wdk	1317835113.0	dummyhead	shroom	[REQUEST] Student Loan Blues	We've been pretty responsible people, my Girlfriend and I.  We've worked hard, spent within our means, and have always been on time with all of our bills and rent.  It seems that last part may have gotten us in a bit of deep water.  After doing the right thing and scraping by, it has come.  My Girlfriend's student loans have kicked in.  This has been a bit of a culture shock to us, and in all honesty, we weren't prepared.    Our total amount of bills almost doubled because of this new one.  My girlfriend has been a bit stressed of late, as have I, because it's increasingly looking like one of us(if not both) is going to have to take on a second job, or the eviction fairy shall be making it's rounds.  We have enough food for maybe one meal, and the nearest payday is next week.  It would be a great stress reliever, and an overall solid evening if me and my girlfriend could share a Pizza tonight.    It would be double the awesome, because her absolute favorite food is pizza, and seems skeptical of this entire community(Reddit all together, not just RAOP). If one of you fine Redditors could show us the way to pizza goodness, not only will you have the good karma, and satisfaction of helping a hard working college grad out, I'll also get my girlfriend to draw you a rad picture!  Win, Win in my book.    I'm located in NW Ohio, and at the moment we only have a Pizza Hut within the miles we have gas to make it too. Thank you in advance, and know, that I am in love with the RAOP community.  This is a true beacon of humanity.  Kudos!   EDIT: Thanks so much to Frankto for hookin' it up!	True

So here is what I am lookin receive, a nice pizza for myself and the GF to enjoy this afternoon while watching a movie.   In return I shall offer this, I am a fairly creative guy with less than stellar grammar skills so; I will write for you a small short story a few paragraphs. You can set the plot, characters, timeline, and any other strange quirks that you would like incorporated. I'll do my best to accomplish what you want, if you like the story than we make a trade. If you don't well than I just wrote you a short story for fun?   So there it is Reddit, if someone is willing to work with me here I'd be grateful.

It won't turn back on. Yes, it's plugged in. The cord is a week old.   If you can help me fix it, I'll buy you a pizza. I don't have a shit lot of money, but it's better than Paying someone to look at it.   This really sucks. Like reaaaaallllly sucks.   I'm typing this from my damn iPod so I might not be able to respond very quickly. Thanks!!  EDIT: I just stole my friend's laptop. I *really* needed my Reddit fix. I'll be able to use this for a while. If it isn't fixed by 3pm (US east coast), I'm gonna take it to someone.  **EDIT: Stepdad is gonna take care of it. Goddamnit. Anyway, I promised a pizza, so I'll pick someone at random and message you.** Straight from the step-dad's mouth: "Holy shit! This is the first time my daughter *didn't* break something (electrical/appliance) she couldn't fix!" That cheered me up even though he was teasing me. Simply because I didn't trash this POS beyond repair, I'm happy to offer a pizza. **Thank you to everyone who came to my rescue!!!**	True
t3_l1lcz	1317812496.0	DEStudent	PIF	OFFER! Pizza from a Muslim	**HELLO ALL** Well the time has come that I can finally begin helping rather than requesting. So I'm thinking of how I want to do this. I'm going to make this post a contest. Some of you may know that I am a Muslim woman. Rather than a number generator, **I want someone to guess my favorite surah of Quraan. You don't need to be Muslim to enter.** **It's that simple. One entry per person. The first one that guesses correctly will win a gift card to one of the top 3.**  Also, because I know we have trolls, anyone making sarcastic or rude comments, will not only be disqualified, they will also be reported. It's my offering, my money and I can decide who is gifted. Thank you.  Keep guessing all! I will announce the winner later this evening. There are 114 Surahs  **EDIT**: Contest is officially closed all. My favorite Surah is Surah Yaseen 36. For those curious to hear it or what it means, here is a link to a Youtube recitation. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrD8gO43F0c with English Subtitles.   I have many favorite, but that one just touches my heart. I know some of you may be wondering- So what? Why did I post that I am Muslim? Well honestly, I wanted people to know that despite a lot of media coverage, not all Muslims are terrorist. There's no need to fear us or hate us. Those that are so extreme make up less than 1% of my way of life...  It's my sincere intention that I helped some people, maybe got them to thinking and at least fed some people today. I also sent pizza to others that may not have guessed correctly, but just genuinely seemed to wanted/needed one. I hope that if anyone has any **questions about Islaam or about what we believe they will ask me or another Muslim**.  Lastly, I plan to give another day and time and I look forward to hopefully helping others and making people **smile!** Please don't be discouraged if you didn't win. **THANK YOU ALL FOR PLAYING AND TAKING TIME TO READ**	True

Like the title says I'm in a tight spot and could really use a warm pizza to lift my spirits and give me a break from KD.

EDIT: Thanks to the wonderful DEStudent I will be having pizza for supper! Thank you so much!	True
t3_l1j6v	1317804394.0	in2itiveact	pizza-gold	[Offer] Haven't bought a pizza in a while, figure now's the time.	Here's the scoop. I'm in Australia so if this is going to the USA or UK I can't do a gift voucher I can only put an order in your behalf. So I will need your physical address and phone number to sort this out.  If you're comfortable with that, and are prepared to use the verification system then post a photo on here of you (and anyone you may be sharing the pizza with) including my username and today's date. You can obscure your face if you're shy :)  It's also a condition that you post a pic either of the pizza or you enjoying the pizza when it arrives. If you won't do this, you need not apply. Also - if you say you're going to do it and you don't, bad karma for you :p  Will pick a winner or winners at random. Am happy to order the pizza for a future delivery too.  Get amongst it.  **EDIT: People seem to be missing the initial requirement for a photo with today's date and my username in it. Please don't post your request without it :)**  **EDIT 2: Have thrown pizzas to Mr_Blue_Sky (Scotland), pengupanda (Germany), Bdiehr (USA) and am looking at the possibility of crossing more borders by ordering one for MesMeMe (Denmark). So three, possibly four pizzas and three, possibly four countries later and I think I'm pizza'd out for this evening - so that's it for this offer. See you next time... !**  **EDIT 3: It's official, fourth pizza away - this time to Denmark. Four countries from a fifth country in one night. Not bad! :)**	True
t3_l0wml	1317760833.0	Grymnir	shroom	(request) Year old redditor looking for some pizza	Times are hard, asked last week and I got no responses, figured Id use my reddit b-day for something I can really use instead of karma whoring it up.  EDIT: I'm asking because i genuinely need it, not because its my reddit b-day, I have been working day labor because I cant get an actual job where I live, but part of the problem with day labor is if you dont get sent out for whatever reason, you dont eat that day. I havent been sent out since friday. So here i am. :/	True
t3_l0v3j	1317758483.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	[OFFER] Anyone in San Antonio, TX - (Willing to potentially be on TV)	I switched to a throwaway for RAOP giving once the ABCNews coverage tied my Reddit username to my real life name.  (I kind of freaked out when googling turning up my real name in the top ten results.)  However, RAOP has been contacted by group wanting to show off our community and I've been willing to forsake my internet privacy in the name of spreading the Random Pizza message.  So I'm offering to anyone in San Antonio who also is willing (potentially--- nothing set in stone yet) to be filmed.  Please Post details of your situation.  Live Long and Pizza  EDIT - Just to be clear the offer is for PIZZA + 15 minutes of fame.  So at the very least you'll get some hot saucy goodness.    EDIT2 - Congrats to the 3 Recipients chosen.  That is my budget for the month, so  I won't be able to feed any more.	True
t3_l0oj4	1317748010.0	christmasape	shroom	[REQUEST]I've been robbed. (MO)	So I went out for a run last night, and was gone from home for around 30-40 minutes or so. When I returned home, I was greeted by the sight of a broken window and a clearly kicked in back door. After calling the police, I took an inventory and found my wallet, laptop, XBox, my kids' Wii and DS, and my ipod all missing, as well as any cash that was laying around. (Bastards broke my son's piggybank even. Hope that five bucks was worth it.) The police told me these types of things are rarely resolved unless there's a huge amount of luck involved, but they do have serial numbers and everything, so we'll see.   This leaves me in a position where I'm going to be up to my ass in insurance company dealings all day, not to mention canceling necessary cards, getting a new license, fixing the door, etc. All while broke and low on food. (Today was to be grocery day.) If someone would like to help us out for the night, it would be greatly appreciated and paid forward as soon as I can get my ducks in a row again. Sorry for the wall of text lol.  **Edit Thanks to setlax182! Gift card received. And to capitalb620 as well. What an amazing group of folks here.**	True

t3_l076w	1317703640.0	sprileet	pizza	[Offer] (sort of) "Give a man a pizza and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to pizza and you feed him for a lifetime."	Ok, so maybe this proverb doesn't apply *quite* as well to pizza as it does to fish...  In any case, I saw that Amazon has a really great deal on [The Complete Idiots Guide to Pizza and Panini](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Pizza-Panini/dp/B005FOGGQS), and I'd like to buy a few copies for you guys. I just found out about this subreddit, and I think it is a really great thing that you guys are doing here. I would totally donate a pizza today, but I am currently _very_ cash poor.   Luckily, I do have a balance on some Amazon gift cards. There are currently 3 of these books left on Amazon at this price, so as long as they are still available, I'll give away all 3 of them.  I know that this isn't exactly how people usually give away pizzas here, but its all I can afford to do right now. It certainly seems to be consistent with the spirit of this subreddit, so I hope it is ok with everyone. If for some reason this is against the rules, please let me know and I will delete this post.  Logistically, I think that the best way to get the book to you would be for you to create an [Amazon wish list](http://www.amazon.com/wishlist) with the book on it. Amazon keeps your personal information (email address and shipping address) private... That way you don't have to give out your personal information to anyone (including me). If anyone has a better/safer way to do this, please advise... but I'm pretty sure that Amazon wish lists are about as safe as it gets.  I think it'd be fun to know that someone baked their first pizza with a little bit of help from me :) It'd be awesome to see pictures of the pizza that you cooked after reading it... so preference will be given to those who would not only be likely to actually make use of the book by making a pizza, but would also be willing to come back and show us your creation.   **TL;DR - I don't have any cash to buy you a pizza per se, but I do have an Amazon gift card to buy you a book that will teach you how to cook pizza.**  *EDIT: I'm heading to bed now, so I won't check this again until sometime tomorrow morning. At that time, I'll do what I can to fulfill several requests. Since the current Amazon price is so low, I'd really love to buy them for people at this price before they sell out (and before I run out of money). I've already committed to sending one to prances_with_pantses, and hopefully at least a couple more people indicate their interest before they are gone.*  *If there happen to be more requests than I can fulfill, then I'll decide who to give to (roughly) based on the following:*  *1) Will I be able to buy the book for you before they sell out? (If you already have an Amazon wish list set up that includes the book, that'd help expedite the process. Don't post any personal information, but as long as your wishlist doesn't include personal information and you are comfortable doing so, you could PM or post a link to it.)*  *2) Will you actually make use of the book and cook a pizza? (If so, Great! I'd love to hear that it won't just end up sitting on a shelf.)*  *3) Are you willing to post a picture of and/or story about the first pizza you bake after receiving the book? (If so, I'd love to hear about it, so let me know whether I can to expect to receive a follow-up post sometime in the future)*  *Anyway, if you'd like to receive a book, just go ahead and leave a comment indicating so. I'll send what I can tomorrow morning.*  *I know it isn't much, but I hope that a few of you are able to enjoy this random act of pizza (cookbooks).*   	True

t3_kzie3	1317661300.0	onlyorange	shroom	[REQUEST/TRADE] [UK] I have a US giftcard.. who wants to trade?	I got a giftcard from a very kind redditor the other day and only just realised I have to be from the US to use it. Is there anyone who would take it in exchange for ordering me a pizza in the UK or sending me money so I can do it? I know it sounds tight and I should just give it to someone in the US but I've just come home and my Mum is out tonight and hasn't left any money/food. I'd end up eating kidney beans or sweetcorn or some sh*t if nobody takes me up.  Thanks a lot!  EDIT: The giftcard is a $25 Dominos gift card! I would like a large cheese and tomato pizza from a Dominos in the UK which I doubt will come to $25. 	True

t3_kyp31	1317592169.0	leftnewdigg	pizza-gold	[Request] Family of ONE. Buffalo, NY	EDIT #2 - Thanks for the kind words and generous offers, jetboyterp hooked me up, I'll feast tomorrow.  Want to give a pizza, but don't want to get scammed? Here's your chance! I'll be honest, this pizza would likely be for tomorrow night or Tuesday night, but I would never normally consider asking except that I'm a little drunk right now. I used to be pretty active on this subreddit and gave multiple times before parts of it just turned me off (haha, I'm not even sure this will post, I may have been banned!). I am not poor, just broke. I have a decent job and usually have enough money to pay all the bills and have some leftover for "fun". I am not on food stamps. I am not a single mom. I don't even have any kids (I'm sorry!!!!). But last week my uncle passed away. It was not shocking or devastating, he was very sick, elderly and we weren't close. BUT, I had to give my mom about $60 towards the flowers we sent to the funeral, AND I had to take 8 hours unpaid time off to go to the funeral, so it will be a 32 hour check this week. So this week is WAY tighter than usual, and if anyone could hook me up with a Pizza Hut gift card (they are the only of the big 3 in my area), I will be very grateful for the help eating this week, and I will definitely post a thank-you complete with pictures. If someone is willing to help me out this week, I will be willing to come back next week and keep giving.    EDIT: Just because I don't have a gaggle of hungry kids right now doesn't mean I won't someday, and I guarantee you that my potential future children all would be very appreciative of you helping me now.

Times are hard here, I don't have a stove to stretch my food budget further and the food bank here is only open on Wednesdays. We've been applying like crazy at any job available since we moved back here to my hometown, but nothing so far. We had to spend the last of our money on gas, car insurance and repairs so we could have transportation to a job if anyone ever calls back. I know I've gotten a pizza here before, I've been broke for the past 3 months or so since I've moved, just waiting for the call for a job so I can pay it forward to you kind people.

This is somewhat of a photo scavenger hunt, somewhat of an offer, and generally something to keep me entertained.

Of course, thought went into these ten requests, by no means did I just pick out random items from around my room.

Yesterday she, out of no-where, announces that she is going to get married THIS MORNING. No friends, no family...they just signed a paper at town hall and she even had to come into work after.   My request? This girl is obsessed with Margarita Pizza and Pizza in general...she eats it everyday. She didn't come in with any today though. I'm guessing it's because she just got married with no party and miiiiiight be a little sad about it.  I don't know why they didn't have a ceremony as I'm afraid to bring it up.  Personally, I just started working here and haven't gotten my paycheck yet so I'm broke. Would anyone be able to order a large Margarita for this poor girl?

t3_kwdx8	1317385120.0	Collaterlie_Sisters	PIF	[OFFER] A Friday night pizzazza to one of you! (UK only, as we often get neglected)	As promised previously, I want to gift a pizza to a hungry hippo as a thanks for this community being SO DAMN COOL. The important bit - the qualifier:  We all like to see the fruit of our labours, and on RAoP most posters ask for a photo of the spoils once it's been received. This isn't good enough for me, I don't goddamn trust you, so to qualify you must do the following...  Post a photo of you enjoying the pizza you do not yet have. It has to be the exact photo you would post if you had, in fact, got the pizza, but I'm requesting to see it beforehand so we're clear on everything. If you want to post a photo once you get the pizza, great, do it for the karma.  I get home at 6.30 and I'll pick a winner then - it'll be a dominoes or something, no gift card, just straight up phone-in a delivery to you. So you'll need to be comfortable giving me your address. Don't worry, I'm too lazy to go to my own friends houses, let alone a RAoPtor's.  Ps: I like cats, that'll score extra points. GO!  **Edit:** I'll be back home in 30 mins, at which point [one of you *will* get pizza](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01418/sugar_1418175c.jpg). Also, thank you [AdamBs](http://www.reddit.com/user/AdamBs) for the Reddit gold!! :D  **Final edit:** I've decided. :) Thanks all, have a good evening and keep RAoPing!	True
t3_kw5di	1317358805.0	neverandever	pizza	Been drinking...ready to offer a pizza!	Title pretty much explains it all.

t3_kvd0u	1317310561.0	jetboyterp	jetboyterp	[Contest] It's that time again...	OK, new contest.    Think about this:  You are a country.  Meaning you, personally.  Think about what the flag of the country of you might look like.  Flag design should reflect your personality, likes, etc...something(s) about and representative about you.  Go [HERE](http://artpad.art.com/artpad/painter/), click on the logo somewhere, and draw your flag there.  When done, click *save & send* then click on the right side, halfway down the box where it says *for link only click here*.  Copy/paste that link in this thread.  That's it!  There will be two winners.  One $30 gift card, winner chosen on sheer awesomeness of their flag execution and design, and one $20 gift card, for the "not so artistic" amongst RAoP, winner chosen for my perceived time and effort you put into your design, and it being a cool flag.  So you don't have to be an artist to win a gift card.  Card will be good for Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's (your choice) and winner will be chosen tomorrow evening, Friday, at 7pm EDT on Sept. 30th.  Any questions about the artpad site, the contest requirements or further explanation, or how to link, let me know in the comments.    Cheers, and good luck!   **Edited for spelling.  ****EDIT 2**:  (Thu, 2:40pm) Wow, some really cool ones in already...everyone's on the right track for sure.   ****EDIT 3**:  (Thu, 7:05pm) Whoa...there's a few that raise the bar there.   Remember tho, there's two card, one for the obvious arteests, and one for the no-so-obvious Picasso.    ****EDIT 4**:  (Fri, 11:00am)  lotta entries...I may have to recruit some help judging...8 more hours to go...  ****EDIT 5**:  (Fri, 5:00pm)  Going over everything...I'd do this early, but if someone's working on one, I gotta be fair and keep it to 7pm.    ****FINAL**:  Cheers to all the entrants!  It was tough, but here are the winners...  $30 gift card goes to [resolutionsz](http://artpad.art.com/gallery/?lsb381m9vd0) !  Awesome work there!  $20 gift card, after deliberating between three, goes to [razzmatazz1313](http://artpad.art.com/gallery/?lsbkd554nrg) !  I only wish I could send everyone a card...Congrats to da winners, pm me with your choice of pizza place and your email, and I'll send those out ASAP.  Thanks!  	True
t3_kvf6l	1317314031.0	DEStudent	PIF	REQ Pizza in 19720 because my water is off!	Hello all: I have a request... Pizza... and a coke...  My apartment is upgrading the water system(leaving me without any running water) and I'm still waiting on my FAFSA to show up; this leaves me without water and without cash. I plan to pay it forward soon as my FAFSA money comes in.  They installed new toilets in my building on Tuesday but they are still working on this even though it's Thursday. It's been off for 3 days now between 9a-5p.  I can flush, but would love a pizza and soda to make this time go by a little less painfully. If someone can help, great, if not, please look for me soon to be handing out some Cheesy Goodness!  Thank you all!  **Edit- Ok, I couldn't make this up if I was paid to, the water has been off and last night, I hear drip, drip, drip when lying in bed. I thought it was rain only to discover the apartment above me has a leaky air conditioner that leaked down on my clothes and my laptop. I didn't panic, I called my insurance company this morning. Since my laptop is older and I have a $500 deductible, it's really not worth it. I do have a desktop, but I will miss my laptop. :-(  I know it's early but I would love to pizzza myself out with all this headache and hassle. I can and will post pics of the damage** TL- water off, water back on, neighbor's leaky air conditioner leaked on to my laptop.  	True
t3_kv9bv	1317303933.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] Shitty day 	Although parts of today were good, enough shitty things happened that today was the worst day in quite awhile. To prove that bad luck happens on threes, today included: a (minor) car accident, news of someone dear's imminent death from cancer and the potential crushing of an ideology held for a very long time (it's complicated).   So. Maybe making someone's day better with pizza will make today a bit more worthwhile. A few conditions, though:  1) it's nearly midnight here so I won't be sending any pizza out for 12 hours or so, maybe a bit less.   2) I don't know what my requirements are. I'll just pick a request that feels right.   3) if nothing feels right, I'm going to be a b!tch and not give pizza to anyone.   Live long and prosper.   **Edit:** Thank you all for your kindness <3 I realised this morning it was quite a whiny post but you were lovely about it anyway.	True
t3_kv660	1317295728.0	pookie85	FAP	[Request] Today is a very special day for a little girl turning 6. Please read her story.	I know that I have come before you guys for pizza to benefit myself.  But today, the story is different.  For the last two weeks, I have had the joy of watching two incredible girls.  Bre & Skylee, ages 12 and 5..no, 6 as of today.  Skylee's father is currently in El Paso, Texas.  He is a soldier and he had to send his little girl to live with his mother for reasons I cannot explain.  So Skylee is here in Kentucky, away from her father, and it's her birthday.  Her grandmother is an EMT, who works 3 days in a row and isn't here for her birthday today.  But I am, and I'm doing my best to give her an incredible birthday.  She's at school right now, and I promised her I'd try to have a surprise for her when she got home.  She asked me before she got on the bus if she was going to Chucke-E-Cheese's.  That was what she did with her father on every birthday.  Being in a small town, we don't have anything like that.  And her grandmother won't be home until Saturday, so I won't have any money until then.  So what I'd like to ask, is if anyone would like to make a little girl's birthday even more bright despite the fact her father isn't here to be with her.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.  Edit:  A special thank you goes out to MaeBeWeird for her generosity this morning. Thank you so much!	True

One will be given out at some point this week to a request, the second in this contest.  Unless I end up having to leave computer for some reason, contest will end at 2:00PM EST.     What is the contest, you ask?    Well, good question!  Remember Moe the Camel?  Here is a picture to refresh your memory:  http://i.imgur.com/mB1CE.jpg  There have been many pictures of Moe: as Captain Picard, as The Doctor, with his wife Moeina, as Sherlock Holmes, in a cave.  This was the original, however.   The contest is this:  Draw a picture of Moe.  In a costume.  Doing something.  Draw him like I do, or draw him more realistic, or more ridiculous.  But draw him.  Most upclicks will when, or if that is a tie I will use a randomizer.    Have fun, and don't forget to include his 38 tails like I sometimes do.    EDIT:  Oh, and I already purchased the cards from cashstar last night, so you won't have that pesky wait time.  Fun for me AND for you!    EDIT 2:  Winner by BOTH randomizer AND upclicks is urmomwasabadlay with Moe as the Jimmy John's Delivery Cyclist!

t3_kt9im	1317152158.0	DinoJr14	pizza	OFFER: 15$ Domino's e-gift card for the person who lives the closest to my hometown. Details inside, winner decided at 7:30PM EST, gift card to be sent immediately after.	It's my reddit cake day and I feel kind of dirty after submitting a blatant karma whoring post to r/pics, so I decided to balance my IRL karma by giving someone the best gift of all, pizza! As I said in the title, the redditor who lives closest to my hometown of Winchester, VA will receive a $15 Domino's gift card. If multiple Winchester redditors show up (which would be impressive since I've only met 3...) I'll base the winner on who lives the closest to my actual address. Addresses will be exchanged through PM. And if this results in acquiring a personal stalker, hey, at least I started the relationship off right with a gift. Don't be discouraged if you live in Idaho or someplace super far away, maybe no one will see this thread and you'll win be default. Also, I may throw in a smaller prize for the person who lives the furthest from me (continental US only, sorry overseas redditors :( ). Winner decided at 7:30PM EST, so act quickly!  UPDATE: Bdiehr emerged as the winner and received the $15 gift card. I also threw in $5 cards for taris300 (who was the only other person to send photo proof) and DorthyMantooth (who was the furthest from me in the continental US). I hope you guys enjoy, I had a blast doing this and I'll probably be back soon :)	True

Conditions: I'm in Australia and can't do gift cards. This means I will need your address and phone number. Not comfortable giving that out? Move on. This must be sorted soon. I will go to bed within the next hour and a half. That said, there's nothing to stop me from setting up a future order if you're keen but it isn't pizza time right now. Verification is a must. PHOTOS. I don't know about any other pizza giver, but for me part of the satisfaction of giving is seeing a photo of either the spoils or the recipient enjoying the spoils. If you can't or won't post a photo of that, then move on. Two of my recent giftees have said they'll post pictures and then haven't. Most annoying. Don't be that guy/gal.  Other than that, giddy up. Who is keen? Multiple pizzas may be given out depending on response levels and quality of said responses.  Edit: should have edited this earlier... But gave out two pizzas (menmybabies and Tabor91) and then passed out, so this offer is done with. Until next time....!	True

I'm moving back in with my parents. Why? Last year I moved into a nice little two bedroom place with a roommate. After six months my roommate left because he lost his job. I could barely afford the place and started looking for replacement roommates.  Had one stay for one month then abandon me (That's Craigslist quality there). A third roommate moved in, but only for the summer because he was doing an internship here in Dallas. While he was there I was laid off from my packing/shipping clerk position and spent two months unemployed.  Third roommate's internship ends and he has to go back to school in August. Fourth roommate moves in for the final two months of my lease.  I have a new job now but it pays less and has less hours than my previous job. Three weeks after starting this job, my car caught fire. The power steering pump overheated and ignited. In the time it took the fire department to arrive all plastic components and aluminum pieces under the hood melted and the hood itself was scorched. I only had liability on the car, so no insurance payment.  Sunday I move back to my parent's apartment. A)To help them save money to buy a new car (my mother's was repossessed a couple months ago.) B)So I can save money and buy a car.  Also, I will be 30 on the 25th of October.	True

t3_kpi24	1316815070.0	KevRose	shroom	[REQUEST] Student here - Playing Oblivion all night for the first time. Pizza would be amazing to aid me in my journey!	Hey - The title says it all. After a week of exams, I'm letting myself spend the weekend playing Oblivion, since Skyrim is soon to come out, and I have yet to play Oblivion for myself.  I'm waiting for a client (freelance webdesign is my job) to pay me Sunday, so until then, I really have no food other than chili I made 5 days ago, and has been my only meals every day since.  I'll even do any crazy thing you tell me to do in game, if you're familiar with Oblivion, and consider it done (for better or for worst). I'll murder towns in the name of pizza!  It'd really help - thanks!  [Charlotte, NC]	True

t3_kph2c	1316813236.0	hett	shroom	[REQUEST] Been a tight month, low on money, no groceries in the house -- could use some eats to bridge the weekend.	So, it's been a considerably tight month. I am barely, barely making my rent, let alone my other bills. Hours keep getting cut at work, that sort of thing. Trying to get some quick freelancing jobs done in order to make the rent and have some surplus.  In the meantime, I could use some grub to bridge the weekend without having to spend any money. In the house right now I've got a quarter of a loaf of bread, water, and some lettuce. I had a few slices of deli chicken breast but that was my lunch.  Would really appreciate a random act of pizza! When I have gotten some more money saved up I will definitely return the favor.  Thanks for reading.  Edit: Forgot my location, I'm in Lauderhill, Florida.	True

My wife and I are celebrating our one year anniversary this weekend with basically no money. I just started a new job, and my first pay check was all spent catching up on bills. Neither of us get paid again until next Friday and we have just over $20 to live on for the week, with no food in the house.

t3_kpfiv	1316810484.0	Vekter	shroom	[REQUEST] Jobless and sick of ramen...	Okay, I'll be up-front with ya RAOP. Before we get started, I have in fact requested Pizza in the past, in better days. I completely understand if you don't want to fulfill this one knowing that.  Anyway, about 2 weeks ago, I got laid off. Market and whatnot, couldn't afford to pay me anymore. Finding a job has sucked hardcore, and I am absolutely SICK of ramen. I think I'm actually getting physically sick from eating it, to be honest (though I am a hypochondriac), and I have about $40 to my name which I need for food in the next few weeks and gas money.  So, something from Pizza Hut would make my day quite a bit brighter.  I've got a verification code, and I'll message an admin as soon as we settle up. :)  EDIT: I should note that Pizza Hut and Papa John's are the only games in town, so if you were to send me a gift card it'd have to be to either of those. Also, I live in Tennessee	True

t3_kmv2w	1316622523.0	0bi	pizza	[Offer] Pizza, first one to solve the riddle in the post.	Hi, I'm located in the Netherlands. That means I can buy pizza for someone here, or anywhere in the world,  ## as long as I can pay with paypal.  (of course, I can buy for anyone somewhere in the Netherlands, don't need paypal for that.)  ### The riddle:  A couple throws a dinner party. They invite 4 other couples. All the guests arrive at the same time. Everyone present greets all others (once), except their partner. Greeting can be done in several ways: by waving, nodding etc. **or by shaking hands**.  During dinner the host asks his messmates how many hands they've shaken (so **not** how many people they've greeted). Everybody replies with a different number (of hands they've shaken).   Question: How many hands did the **hostess** shake?  First one to answer correctly (with explanation) gets pizza!  [EDIT]  Please post your location in your reply, that way I can research for possible ways of payment. I will require use of the verification system.    [EDIT] [EDIT]  ### The correct answer has been given multiple times. Order of send-ins: 1. punkkitten8511 2. gimpz 3. fatalillusion 4. garseed 5. mumof2girls 6. Miss_Bee  ### Send me your locations, and I'll work on the pizza, starting from the top (i.e. if I can't get the pizza to punkkitten I'll try gimpz etc.).   [EDIT][EDIT][EDIT]  ### Turns out I can only order directly with paypal in the UK. That means that fatalillusion is the lucky winner. I now know this, I'll specify next time in the post. Sorry punkkitten and gimpz, if I ever get a creditcard I'll get you a pizza.	True

t3_kj2tj	1316303477.0	t__mhjr	shroom	REQUEST: Los Angeles! Starting my business, would love a pizza. Let's make a deal.	Starting a personalized songwriting business. It's going to turn into a community for songwriters and listeners to interact and coordinate the creation of a personalized song. Ideally, it's going to forever close the gap between the songwriter and listener, and give struggling, talented songwriters an opportunity to bring happiness to anyone in need of a song, for anything; but I've got a lot of work to do before then.  I probably won't have enough for rent this month, but my landlord's anniversary is coming up and I'm writing a song for his wife, in exchange for letting me be a week late. This leaves the unfortunate angle of food. I'm all out of bread.  Instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. I will write a song about whatever you want. (Literally.) It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza.

Following up on thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/khznc/offer_payday_pizza_offer_remains_open_til_7pm/ with a second pizza.  Still considering some of the requestors from that thread. (I have an ongoing random-determination list of names)  As before, let me know why you deserve it.  Be hilarious, random, weird... but most importantly show EFFORT, and do your best to post something that everyone else reading the thread will enjoy.  Upvote people you think deserve pizza, I may take public opinion into account.  CLARIFICATION - I am not only offering it to people in the Western US, I just figured closing my previous one at 7pm eastern would be too early for people in other time zones.  The pizza is offered to anyone who has an open pizza place nearby.  WINNER - ~~by random drawing from the short list I picked - rdcarlson for sharing lovely artwork and designs!  Arranging details by PM.~~  ~~Sadly, rdcarlson was not available to recieve pizza - AllieOops wins on re-draw for her positive attitude and good karma from past & current giving!~~  Apparently I am having trouble giving away pizza.  Notifying all the multiple people on my list - ~~first to respond with a verification code and location & preference will get it.~~  Pizza goes to Blinkworks, for faaabulous Thor drawings! :)	True

I have narrowed it down to a handful and will be randomly determining from those.    WINNER IS: ~~mattmagician!~~  (EDIT - ~~IF he responds soon, otherwise I roll again~~ He did not.

t3_kgfae	1316087817.0	Phantasos12	pizza	[OFFER] New to RAOP. Giving away first pie!	Ok, so this is my first post to RAOP, so to mark the occasion I'm giving away a $20 gift card to your pizza chain of choice to the first person who can explain how to fly according to a certain Douglas Adams book. Not looking for an exact quote, just someone who knows the general idea. I won't be able to fulfill this until sometime after 5 P.M. EST though. I really love the idea of this subreddit. Looking forward to getting involved :). Have a good day everyone.  UPDATE: congrats to cmh324 foranswering correctly first! For those interested, the full explaination of how to fly is in the book " life, the Universe, and Everything" by Douglas Adams and it's quite amusing. It's a part of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. I highly reccommend them if you like silly but intelligent humor. Have a nice day everyone and thanks for the welcomes :)	True
t3_kfyb8	1316046452.0	Wolfemann	PIF	[Request] I am requesting pizzatastic assistance. 	So, I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this. Basically, I've been lurking on this subreddit for about two weeks, and let me say, you people sure don't disappoint!   Anyway, I recently remembered that I haven't had one of Domino's delicious oven-baked sandwiches in a long time. So, in more or less words, I have a hole in my stomach that would be fixed by one. But, as luck would have it, I'm in the middle of moving and a bit tight on cash.   So, if you grant me this sandwich of delicious-osity-ness, I will write four stanzas of terrible haikus for you. Also, on October 6, I will provide pizza for five accounts. If you doubt I will deliver, well, that's too bad.  Because I will.  tl;dr -      I need a sandwich     From Domino's Pizza Co.     Thank you very much.  Edit: Thank you so much, **CZHUNC**!  Edit 2: As requested, Starcraft 2 Haiku     I am in bronze league.     MMM - To Victory!      This is not so hard.      "What's that?" you may ask.     Chargelot colossus death ball.     "I hear you dying".      Quick, thors to counter.     Suddenly, immortals there!     I am just so bad.      The game is over.

t3_kfxsm	1316045414.0	warchamp7	shroom	[Request] Broke College Student	Currently been living on about 30 dollars for the last week and a half in college, waiting to get my student loan. There's been a strike going on though so I couldn't try to schedule a pickup until this week, and today I learned they still think I'm on my probation from last term (Which I corrected by achieving a high enough GPA and got off probation with the school, but not OSAP).   Anyway, it's going to be a while before I can even pick up that loan but even after all that it will take a little bit before it's deposited to me. A pizza would easily last me a few nights worth of dinner and certainly beat the rice krispies and peanut butter sandwiches I've had for every meal the last week.  Once that loan comes through I'll be sure to pizza it forward if someone comes through for me :)  I'm located in Oakville, Ontario	True
t3_kfuhx	1316039265.0	mrautomatic17	pizza	[OFFER] TO THE PERSON WHO LOOKS MOST LIKE BILLY MAYS!	So here's the deal, I'm a fourth year college student and I'm broke as hell (obviously, college is expensive) BUT just got my loan refund check deposited into the bank today. CA CHING!  I've always wanted to get in on the action here at RAOP, but I've never had any money or mustered up the dignity to ask for a 'za on here.  Sooo...  Now that I have some cash money in the bank (not really), I am going to have a little contest of my own.  As a marketing major, one of my idols has always been BILLY MAYS. I've actually pitched a few products myself and let me tell you I am far from Mr. Mays, but I digress...  I'm not asking anyone to pitch a product like BILLY MAYS (although that would be awesome), I'm just asking you to post 2 things:  * A picture of yourself if you think you look like my idol BILLY MAYS * A note card of some sort with the date and your username to prove it's you  It's that simple.  My roommate and I will judge the quality and authenticity of your submissions. Hopefully we will have a Domino's Pizza out by tonight!  Good luck!  *Edit (8:33pm EST): We're going to give this contest another hour or two and then we are heading to the bars. Last minute entries are welcome!  **Edit 2 (9:46pm EST): CONTEST CLOSED. My roommate and I (along with others now) are going over and voting on your submissions! We are seriously impressed with everyone's entry!  ***Edit 3 (10:01pm EST): Congratulations to [smeenatchu](http://www.reddit.com/user/smeenatchu)! Better late than never on the entry! We came to the conclusion that since you would sell an 8 year old for only 1 easy payment of $19.95, you could probably use a pizza! For those who didn't win, thanks for participating. Your consolation prize is a video of [Stop Motion Pizza Eating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lim0iDMo9S0) dedicated to Billy Mays!	True

t3_kdqot	1315878572.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	Thoughts for requesters	I'd like to state first up that these are just some thoughts. Not even solid hypotheses, or firm opinions, or unbreakable laws. Further, they're just MY thoughts and shouldn't be taken to represent anyone else here, although I'd appreciate other people's thoughts too.  RAoP is awesome. I'm sure you knew that already. Requesters have the chance to be gifted with tasty pizza, and givers get the chance to help someone out and feel warm and fuzzy about it.  Sometimes I see a lot of unanswered requests and it makes me wonder why some requests get offers but not others.   Here are my thoughts:   * The people who give pizza, on the most part, aren’t spectacularly rich or anything. They’re people who are doing ok, or who have an extra bit of money this week, or have a bit of discretionary income. They’re people who are not buying that new pair of shoes/new game/cup of coffee/magazine/expensive food because it’s more fun and rewarding to give pizza. Givers can’t afford to give to everyone, so every giver has their own criteria (and WHATEVER that criteria is, it’s a perfectly fine criteria).  * Posts with only one line requesting a pizza may be more likely to be overlooked because perhaps it’s easy to draw a line between how much effort someone puts into requesting a pizza to how much they want it.  * Similarly, people with accounts which are hours or days old, or only post on RAoP may be overlooked because they may be creating the impression that all the requester is interested in is pizza.  * People are empathetic – they like to hear stories and feel connected and involved. Perhaps telling a bit about yourself and your situation may help people connect with you. If your account is a new account, this may be particularly important, as there’s not even a reddit history to look at. Let people know what a pizza would mean to you. Perhaps you could describe your job, or your family, or the things that you like to do/watch/play. Maybe your burning passion for alpacas is shared by another alpaca enthusiast who happens to have some extra money from an alpaca sale. Make the reader feel as though you’re not just a screen-name looking for a quick feed, but a real, live, feeling person whose day would be brightened by a pizza or two.  * Speaking as someone who’s given a couple of pizzas away, there’s nothing more I like than seeing a photo afterwards! (It can be via PM, and it doesn’t even need to show you in it.) I like to know that the pizza got there safely and that you’re enjoying it. Your joy is my reward. Also, *please* and *thank you* are wonderful words – free to use and they make the world a nicer place. Please, use them liberally.  **TL;DR** – nothing, these are just some idle thoughts. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT take them as RAoP gospel or apply them as though they were! Oh, and don’t be mean to each other. That’s not nice. :P 	True

t3_kcldp	1315791186.0	KeeperEUSC	shroom	[REQUEST] We are Ivy League Students Willing to Confirm Every University Stereotype in Exchange for Food	Here's my pitch:  I'm a sophomore at Yale University, and I've got a long week ahead of me - I've got a fundraiser to run in New York City, I'm going to be without my laptop for a week while it is being serviced, and classes are actually making us do work now.  I could go on and on about my firstworldproblems, but I think you get the picture.   What I'm asking for tonight is what I think will be a fair exchange.    1) YOU ... provide the food. New Haven is arguably the pizza capitol of the world (I can hear the hisses already), and so there's plenty of pizza places out there we can set this up for, however... There is also a really awesome website called OneButtonWenzel.com that allows you to a press a single button and order the ultimate buffalo chicken sandwich.  It's cheap, its easy, it supports a business - a great deal for you.  2) I... Will do my best to give you a fair shake. I'm not going to make some sort of pitch that you're helping a dying college student over here - we do have a meal plan and everything, so I want to give you something of substance.  I will photograph the consumption of your order, while confirming as many Ivy League/Yale stereotypes as possible.   AS A BONUS If you order two (2) WENZELS, my whole SUITE will get in on the action! That's right, you'll have a pictures of a room full of WASPY New England folks enjoying the delicious late night meal you have provided.  Offers like this don't come around every day - now is the time for food.  I hope you'll join me in this venture.   EDIT: Zombica has been kind enough to provide us with food, and so we'll do our part to provide the pictures while we are waiting for it to arrive. Delivery here is totally random, so it could be until 2:00am before they deliver - if that's the case, it is a risk we are willing to take.  EDIT 2: The Wenzels arrived, and they were awesome. Check out the pics below, and give Zombica as much karma as possible - she is the best, and totally made our week.	True

I'm an independent business guy who turned being laid off a year and a half ago into my own small business. It's been challenging, but generally working out.

Due to me already having gift card, Gonna be a pizza to Dominos!  And here be my list for this one! And hey im gonna complete the list myself!  1. Favorite Picture, video, or pretty much feel good thing! 2. A short or long essay abut what the day means to you today. (if it means nothing, that works too, just thought it was fitting for the day.) Maybe include something like where you were or what you were doing on this day 10 years ago.  3. Take a picture with your name and mine, and draw your favorite animal on it. ^_^ 4. A love story! Something to make me say awwwww! (although I cheated down below, id like something different here then 1.) 5. Favorite song with a link. ^_^  ------  1. Favorite flash: [There she is!](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/161181) - its actually a full series. love it! 2. This day is a day of remembrance to me in the sense that when this happened 10 years ago, I didn't know what it meant. It wasn't till a few years ago that it truly set in. I was in middle school doing Radio and morning announcements when I found out. I remember many of my fellow classmates being taken from classses and being taken home. People were freaking out and rumors started.. I am in a town where FEMA has a building, and people were saying that the president had landed on a main highway here and was being rushed into the building. I think a few years ago it truly set in the enormity of what had happened when I finally sat down and listened to a few of the speeches and watched the videos from years ago. 3. My contest, im skipping this one =P 4. go back up to 1! 5. [Without you - Keith Urban](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3TWpWf798s&ob=av2e)   Rules on the right apply, Verification is required.

t3_kcaqe	1315770008.0	badbrownie	brownie	2 'hardship' pizzas coming up today!	**[EDIT2]** Pootamoonrockit missed out on the required proof.  Candis2k6 Very Sweetly decided to withdraw from the contest because she saw others more in need (though she quoted the pawnedTV story as her example reason for withdrawing and that's the item that went unverified).  So - we try again.  And I'm by my computer now so I'll be able to be more attentive!  I've awarded 3 potentially, but the chances that all 3 will be able to provide proof of their stories is, historically speaking, highly unlikely.  If they can, I'll be buying 3 pizzas, but I'm gonna continue to be a stickler for the requested evidence.  I trust my reasons for that are easily understood. **[/EDIT2]**   **[EDIT**: we have 2 winners.    * candis2k6 just PM'd me (but will have to post on the thread to win the pizza.  Wins, because she actually sent in convincing evidence without me having to propose what I defined as 'proof'.  And she has 1622 comment karma.  A new record in my pizza recipients so I find it easy to trust her. * Putamoonrockonit.  You're a provisional winner.  Validate your story - The Way I Have Requested - and your whole family can dip into pizza tonight.  Without wishing to sound like a dick, if you half-validate or explain why my validation can't be met then I'll move on to a new winner.  I got scammed once and I'm getting comfortable being efficient in this process.  Summary: You deserve it.  So does the next person.   You get first crack!  :)  Both of you, please let me know what kind of gift card you want (PapaJohns/Dominos/Pizzahut) and send me a verification code from [here](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/).**[/EDIT]**  If you're having tough times then prove it and I'll buy 2 of you a pizza (actually, I'll give you a $25 pizza gift card, so with the help of the right coupon it's possible that I'm buying you 3 or 4 pizzas).  However, I'm a suspicious sumbitch so you may find it's a high bar to make me think "Yup, that's Definitely not a clever scammer".  If you think you can get over the bar, then Come On Down!  BTW - I'll be out for a while today so may not be monitoring this thread constantly.  So it's possible that the pizza you win will be feeding you tomorrow night.	True

I've got a free pizza from Papa Johns from the papa points system, and I'd like to give it to someone here!  Since this will be coming from my Papa Johns account, I will need to know your address to get the order through. If you aren't comfortable with that, I apologize, but this is the only means I have to do this right now. I've given before and received as well (though I don't think I have icons for either) so I promise I'm not going to stalk you. You may be able to even just give me a generic address in your city if you want to do carry-out.  Rules!  * One guess per hour * Each hour, if no one has guessed it, I'll add a hint. You can then guess again. * Player is currently on the team. * You don't have to be a Steelers fan. Hell, you can even be a Ravens fan and I'll give you the pizza if you win. Just grudgingly so.  I'm going to go try and find an antenna for my TV so I can hopefully watch the game later. I'll be back to look through the guesses in the order they come in.  Good luck!  Hint one: in the nfl shorter than big ben  Hint two: Not really necessary, there's very few options left after all that's been guessed, but, he's a defensive player. Everyone's welcome to guess again now  **[Winner](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/kc35y/offer_papa_johns_guess_my_favorite_steelers_player/c2j304g)** 	True

t3_kam7x	1315612294.0	CatalystParadox	FAP	[OFFER] 2 Medium 2-topping Pizza (sorry, Dominoes only) to... someone who gives me a reason I like.	I just discovered RAOP this past week, and amidst what has otherwise been a rather shitty week, this good-hearted exchange of pizza has inspired me.  And here I am today, thinking how nice a pizza would be...  But then I see all the requests on this page.  Wasn't it the altruism, not the pizza, that inspired me in the first place?  Better to give, I say.  I don't know what my criteria are.  Let me know why I should give you pizza, whether its sad, weird, awesome, hilarious, or just plain random.    The give will be this deal from dominoes: http://www.dominos.com/pages/track.jsp?promocode=HME599 - I'd like to say "whatever place within reason" and do two or three seperate gives, but, I'm actually pretty broke right now.  Looking forward to giving more freely in the future.  P.S. - Be able to tip your driver as I cannot through the ordering system.  Edit - a few responses in, I've figured out my criteria: - Make me feel like you need/deserve pizza more than I do (I decided to spend the few bucks I have giving instead of getting for myself) - The post that makes me feel best about giving you pizza wins.  So I guess in a way it's selfish after all :P  UPDATE - Pizza sent to KimBERLY71 and her daughter.  Hooray for that!  Dominoes deal did not work, apparently, and I was charged twice what was advertised... not hooray for that part.  Consider this a recommendation against using dominoes, if possible.  D'aww....

t3_k90ov	1315502748.0	MonkeyHouse	pizza-gold	[Offer] feeding a starving artist - or two.	Here's the deal. My boyfriend's birthday is October 4th and I would like to produce for him a piece of artwork. He knows I participate in redditgifts and RAOP so I think he would really appreciate an internet created, personal gift.  I want something physically sent to me in the mail. Since I know this is a lot to ask, I'm willing to offer two pizzas AND a care package in exchange for the art. I have no requirements for what the artwork medium is (painting, drawing, computer designed, etc.) So long as you put a little thought into it.   If you're interested in my offer, leave a comment or pm me. I can provide more information/pictures if requested. I'm at work presently and have limited access to reddit, but I will be able to respond to queries after 5pm eastern.   TL;DR if you appear legit and have artistic talent, I will send you a pizza today and a pizza when I receive artwork from you and a care package of awesomeness.    EDIT 1: Okay, so, finally home! For those wondering: my boyfriend enjoys cars, music (anything from Opeth to Joanna Newsom - no pop or country though) video games, history/science. We have been playing Little Big Planet together recently and previously played a lot of Portal 2. This is a picture of us at the [beach](http://i.imgur.com/fiYMq.jpg). I will give 3 people gift cards to dominos pizza in the next few hours. To those 3 people: if you actually complete my request of artwork, mail it to me, and I receive it by October 4th I will not only send you another dominos gift card but I will put together an awesome care package for you! Inside the care package I will include snacks (you may request favorites, no promises) possibly gift cards (grocery store, maybe pizza!) some crafts I have made and various other things I think may brighten your day. I probably will decorate the crap out of it to, it's what I do. Thank you in advance :0)   EDIT 2: I have sent out 2 pizza gift cards so far. Will be giving away at least one more.

Here is why today sucks:  -Guy I've been seeing for a little over a month socked me in the face last night, so that's over.  -Can't find a fucking job.  -Roommates just ditched on us after eating our food and not paying bills... because they found a better place.  -Don't get foodstamps refilled until the 9th.  -Totally coming down with something.  Damn it, I would love someone forEVER if I got pizza'd. I'm in New Orleans. The only thing close-ish to me that delivers is Domino's.  Le sigh.  **EDIT: Thanks to czhunc, I'm nomming on some delicious chicken-bacon-spinach pizza right now, there's another pizza next to it, and this is an amazing end to a day that started out the crappiest in recent memory. czhunc rocks my face off (and breakfast tomorrow is going to be AMAZING)!**	True
t3_k85fs	1315437612.0	IrritableOwlSyndrome	pizza-gold	[OFFER] Lonely $15 pizza gift card wants to find a home. Who wants to help?	I tried to hook up a fellow active redditor in his request thread but someone beat me to the punch. So now I have $15 that I've already mentally committed to giving away. Who wants it?  Note: I wanted to help out this person because he is extremely active on reddit and has a buttload of karma points. So here's the deal. Meet the following criteria and your name will be tossed into the virtual hat:  - Have more than 1000 karma points - Have an account that is 4 months or older - Be active in a wide variety of subreddits - Promise to pay it forward on RAOP at some point - Not have enough funds to buy your own pizza tonight  I hope to find someone by 5:00 pm Pacific time.  :)  edit: Apparently I am supposed to include my location in my post. **SoCal.** There. But I will send the gift card anywhere where Dominos, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns can deliver to.  **FINAL EDIT: AtheistAgnostic has been pizza'd.**	True

t3_k7af8	1315374265.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] For anyone who's not feeling well or has temporarily broken themselves	**Caveat:** I want to see whether I can order pizza from Australia to the US. Found out today that I can send it to Canada, which is awesome, but now I want to try my luck in the States. If it turns out that I can't send pizza to the US, clearly I won't be sending pizza :P  That said, I'd like to make someone feel better if I can :) Post a pic or something with RAoP/date/jesses_girl on it. If a picture's not an option, I'm sure something else can be worked out. I'll also scroll through your history because I'm curious like that.  Pizza will most likely be Domino's, which is what worked going to Canada. I'll leave this up for 24 hours or so because I think this is a weird time in the US atm.  **Edit:** I picked cryemoxkidcry for a pizza, because if getting thrown through a windshield doesn't merit a pizza, I don't know what does! But I'll still leave the post active for another 7 hours like I originally said I would and if a story compels me to buy pizza, then I will :)	True
t3_k6wyx	1315349566.0	Stregano	pizza	[offer] Random Acts for Random Pizza	Now, some of this text I will tell you, it is just how I am, so please do not judge me.  I am doing well in life right now. I am not rich, but I am far from poor.  I want to give somebody a random pizza. In true fashion of a place called random acts of pizza, this will be random. How random? Well, kinda random.  I am more than happy giving a person in need some help, but I can tell you this, I am not planning on giving a person in need a pizza. If you are looking for that, hit up one of the other threads about that, as I am not about that.  Do something cool. Write a short story. Write a cool song. Draw a picture. Paint a painting. Obviously, if you do something with physical stuff like record a gymnastics performance from when you were 12 and you were amazing, I am not expecting a hard copy of that tape, or if you paint a painting, I am not asking for your painting, but maybe an image of it thrown up on imgur or something. Hell, maybe a cool wallpaper in photoshop. Maybe do some parkour in your backyard. Maybe make a video showing me your awesome gasoline rc car running. Whatever your skill is in life or whatever you enjoy in life, use it and show us a random act (please, lets keep it legal though folks).  I don't care what it is, but make it random. It can be about pizza if you want, but I could care less if it is not. Now, I started coming here because I enjoy the after images of people who get pizzas. I love those images. The people are just so damn happy, and now I want to do that for somebody.  So r/raop, let's get random. I will be honest, there is a 90-95% chance that it will just be an online gift certificate or something since I do not really check reddit from home (plus, it gives everybody time). This is not a do something cool and get pizza tonight, as that would not be fair to everybody. I am thinking sometime tomorrow, or Thursday, or possibly even Friday (Friday pizza on me, that might not be a bad idea). Keep it awesome and keep it random. Remember, this is not a talent show, it is you being random. Maybe one of you draws a picture and you drew your damn heart out, but that image sucks ass, well, this is random, so it might get picked.  I have never given on this site, but that is changing now. Take your time. Do not rush what you want to do. If anybody wants an extension if they are working on something, chances are I will extend it.  Remember, this is not a talent contest, but I will say that I will lean towards people either posting something about what they enjoy or are good at. So if you just reply with a curse word, sure it is random and you have a chance, but hell, even if you think your job is boring, throw something up on wordpress and talk about it and let us be the judge. Maybe you are a collector (like me personally, I am a video game collector and with enough digging, or you asking nicely, I am willing to show images of it).  So, a pizza on me. Sob stories will not get pizzas (unless, that is, you are really good at telling short stories, but please say something if you are). There are plenty of others out there to give those people pizza, and that is not me.  tl;dr - keep it random, keep it legal, I will lean closer to people who post their talents (just words in the post, an image, youtube video, blog post, etc) even though this is not a talent show, sob stories will not get pizzas here (sorry, but that is how I roll, there are plenty of other threads for that)  EDIT: upvotes will help. Since that means that a bunch of people like whatever it is that you post. Also, if you post something up anywhere, just provide some type of proof it is you. I will not be that picky, but this is the 1st time I have offered anything, and if somebody posts up something awesome they just Googled for, then honestly, I probably won't be nice and give people pizza anymore. Just sayin, please show some way, even if small, to prove it is you  EDIT 2: The purpose of me doing this is to prove a point to not just me, but to yourselves. A good point, and that is that some people do not care how much money you have. We all have something about us that makes us unique. Flaunt it and be yourself, and who knows, maybe someday, like in the next couple days, some random dude on the internet will want to see it and buy you a pizza for it. We are all unique individuals, so I am looking for something that you personally do. Don't show me something your kid does or your parent or your uncle. I want you. Yes, the person reading this, I want to see a small glimpse of you, not somebody else. Don't think that you can't impress me. It is not about that. Your talent in my opinion may suck ass, but if it is your talent, I will hold it in high regard.  EDIT 3: I have not given any pizza out yet. I am still letting this ride out. I personally am unsure when I will pick the random people, but it will more than likely be tomorrow or Friday, so please do not feel like you would be left out from posting something random and fun.  EDIT 4: I have decided to give multiple people pizza money. It could be 5 people, it could be 2. It will be a minimum of 2 (probably 2, but maybe 3 depending on how cheap I can get a mattress for my bed since my current one blows).  FINAL EDIT BEFORE PIES ARE GIVEN OUT: I work until about 5pm Pacific Time, and am going to come home and will get the names, so stay tuned. I will announce the lucky people who gets pies from me here at about 6pm Pacific time. That is the earliest today that I can do it. It will happen, I promise. It may not be exactly 6pm Pacific time. It may be 5:45 or 6:15, but around there  2 People who get Pies: hyuugurt, garseed  congrats you guys.  send me a PM with your e-mail address and the pizza place of your choice where I can send you some type of giftcard to.  If you do not respond within 24 hours (I have been contacted by one of the people already) then it will go to another random person.  If you did not get it from me, do not feel bad.  I will do this again sometime hopefully soon.  The random stuff people posted was awesome and put a smile on my face and everybody else's face.  So please do not think you lost a contest, as I just plugged the names into a random generator I made and these 2 came up the most after 10 runs of the program.  Keep it awesome, and keep it fancy you guys.  Thanks for giving me a great week with the awesome random stuff and thanks for sharing.  I enjoyed every single post on here, and I am sure that everybody else did as well.	True

I've given and received on here before, and I was looking forward to getting paid today so I could post another offer, as I was going to get a pie for dinner myself, along with the usual groceries and whatnot. Unfortunately my boss decided to not show up with everyone's checks today (that guy is a post waiting to happen somewhere else on this site...) so I'm left unable to post my offer, or snag anything tasty for dinner myself. I plan to post an offer tomorrow regardless of how this works out, but I figured if someone was willing to throw me a bone tonight it'd be nice. You guys have usually come through when I need it (or at other random times) so I figured it would be worth a shot. Regardless, I hope everyone gets what they need from this site today.

t3_k5u3c	1315266246.0	badbrownie	brownie	Pizza For The Cutest Smile	<Drama>  Well, I'm not sure how to say this.  Disappointment, thy name is RAOP Pizza Giving.  So - here's the story: yesterday the lovely Brandi's mom earned a hardship pizza.  And inspired by the cute smile Brandi made in the pic I decided to have this contest and let Brandi judge it.  I thought to myself "Wouldn't it be a shame if they fixed it so they snagged another pizza by awarding it to themselves" but I figured that that kind of level of suspicion is where madness lies so I ignored it (just like we all correctly ignore a million little suspicions like that every day).  Then, this morning Nathanbucher posted "Can we email our pic?" and shortly thereafter NathanBucher responded "Well brandi would like to see it so u can email it to us I PMd our email address...".  Hmmmmm.  Not being an utter moron, my first thought was "Shit.  Nathanbucher is a sockpuppet and my honorable judge didn't logout before responding."  But I didn't want to start accusing.  This is RAOP and We Believe In People so I figured I'd just seem confused and hope that the problem would go away.  It was easy for the problem to go away.  All that had to happen was for our judge's mom to realize she was somewhat busted and NOT award the pizza to Nathanbucher.  Then I could have pretended to myself that I saw nothing and not go re-assessing my faith in Reddit strangers.    but Lo, 5pm rolls around and the results are emailed to me and who should have won the pizza in the adult category?  Yup.  :(  I could waffle on about how disappointed I am but, to be honest, life is good to me (as I am to it) so all this is about to be put behind me.  But I'll be more stringent in the evidence I require of hardship in the future and less embarrassed about asking for it.  </Drama>  There.  It's behind me.  So obviously Nathanbucher and the other "Brandi" nominated winner are not getting pizzas so I pulled my wife into the judging.  There were a couple of super strong contenders.  The late entry from imawsomeyay was, as promised, awesome, but the mrs and I were in agreement that Mom is going to have to learn that you can indeed get things with nothing but your good looks when those looks are fronted by sandpipers smile.  PM me and send me a verification code and your email addy and your preference of pizza coupon (papajohns/pizzahut/dominos) cos you're a winner.  In the under 13 category there was, in the end fewer contestants.  After Cassiewilber's nomination was DQ'd (no blame, you may be totally innocent but I trust you'll understand my reasoning), the award goes to cuttyflam, who - hilariously - may be the mom for all I could tell but if you are then you've aged well 'cos you just took the under 13 category!  :)  Sorry for the drama.  I'm not interested in appeals of innocence though and will try to avoid getting pulled into anything to do with such appeals.  **[EDIT: This contest may end up getting lopsided if there are lots of kid entries.  I love the "Know Thy Judge" strategy of entering kid pics but to give the grown ups a chance we're going to award 2 winners.  One in the Over 13 category and one in the Under 13 category (if you're 13 you are therefore disqualified! :))  So - don't give up just cos you're old and the judge is 5.  Brandi: It's 2 winners we'll be needing]**  The judge will be Brandi, the 5 year old daughter of CassieWilber (winner of a pizza pie today).    I'll send a $25 pizza coupon to whoever Brandi decides looks like the nicest person based on their smile.  Her decision is final.  I don't care if you've won a pizza every day you've logged in, if you can convince her you're the nicest entrant based on your smile, then you're about to win another.  This contest will be decided tomorrow at 5pm PDT.  Cassie, let me know if that's too late for your little girl and I'll move it earlier.  So put up pics of you with your best smile.  Also include a sign saying hi to Brandi.  She's your judge and it is she who will award the prize!  My only restriction is that the sign is a requirement to demonstrate the pic is of you and taken for the contest.  Good luck to all you all!	True

t3_k5pte	1315257983.0	badbrownie	brownie	[Offer] For the needy working single parent, or needy college kid or needy anybody!	[EDIT: Contest Closed.  We have 5 winners: JKenney1 (please contact me to claim!), cassiewilber, Phosoup, and IwillPayYouBack and 12223Go.  Other than that, I'm pizza'd out!]  Prove it to me and I'll give you a pizza coupon.  But here's your challenge.  Whatever evidence you offer I'm gonna ask myself "Does this prove it or is it easy to fake".  If it's easy to fake or is not evidence of hardship then No Pizza For You.  This is a tough contest and it's my first attempt at this kind of thing.  I'm hoping that you guys who are struggling know how to demonstrate it better than I, who am not.  If this contest works then I'll make it a regular thing.  I'm happy to help the needy but have allergic reactions to scammers so it makes it hard.    Some thoughts:  * Photos help but they should be personalized so I know they're from you.  the photo including a piece of paper with BB written on it would suffice.  **I'll probably ignore photos that aren't personalized as I'll think "Too Easy To Fake"** * Evidence of collection agencies chasing you would probably help to convince you were struggling * paychecks (with personalized parts blanked out) and BB written on them would be convincing. * pic of you with the kids would demonstrate need also  Please don't post any pics that give away personal info.  Redact that out.  Cover it with something or color it black.  Up to you, but please don't show names, addresses and SSNs on anything you post.  I dunno.  I just want to help the needy and I **know** that RAOP is a great way for some people to see if they can scam people cos, to paraphrase the batman quote, some people just like to see the world buy them a pizza.

t3_k4jaj	1315160167.0	tokenfemale	pizza	[OFFER] $20 Dominos Pizza Card US	A week or so ago, I had a little kerfuffle in getting pizza for someone in Canada - I eventually got him his pizza, but ended up with an extra dominos card in the process. It's for $20, and can only be used in the US.  I love the RANDOM part of Random Acts of Pizza, and am totally one of those who gives pizza to people with stories that just get me for whatever reason or another. So this is for someone with a great, random reason they need a pizza this weekend.  A coupla things tho:  - Please be a redditor of at least a few months. - Please have a verification code - if you have received a pizza recently you don't need a smile now from me. - Please leave out the sob stories. There are tons of people here who respond to those...I am not one of them.   I'll pick the best (in my opinion, this isn't objective by any means) random reason in 4 hours, that way I don't automatically respond to the first funny answer that comes in, which I'm prone to do. :)  Edit: You're all awesome - I'm going to take a bunch that I think are "best," assign numbers, and run through a random number generator. There's no way I can pick one, I dunno what I was thinking!!  **Edit2: Thanks everyone - ended up with over 20 names on the list, used a web-based random number generator, and gave the pizza to blackbanner. :) This was fun!! **	True

t3_k40eu	1315101928.0	Kendallscott	shroom	[Request: Fort Worth, TX] Room mate just bailed on rent money	Having to cover him which means I'm broke until next check in a week. I've never been one to ask people for much, but I've always given away. If anyone in the area could help me out, buy me a pizza so I can make it last a few days, I would love them forever. And I do plan on donating in return as soon as I get paid. And if no one can do this for me, thanks for at least taking the time to read. It's still nice to get the little frustration of my room mate out there. =P  Edit: So, here I am a month later. The last month of our lease, and I was actually abandoned by my other room mate as well. Left to cover the whole rent of 1080. It was paid for, but I've been living off ramen since the beginning of november because of it. I can't think Connor enough for his donation last month, but here I am humbly requesting another pie. And I can't wait until I am in the position again to return the favor to other redditors. 	True

t3_k3lyq	1315068339.0	TheGreatGildersleeve	shroom	A big thanks to **Sierraechowhiskey** for his generosity and a behind the slice look at why it meant so much to me. [*Warning: Wall of text ahead*]	Let me warn you, this is pretty long and personal so skip this if you don't want to read that kind of stuff. Instead of telling my sob story in my request for pizza, I'm going to tell it now that we've eaten because I want to go beyond a mere thank you and give you all some perspective into the difference one giver made for my family and why it's wasn't just the pizza that helped us, but the emotional lift that came from feeling at the end of my rope only to find a generous stranger reach out and throw me and my kids a lifeline.  From the minute I posted my pizza request last night I felt a nervous pit in my stomach and the urge to just delete it and forget about it. *"This is stupid, no one is going to buy you pizza, you look like an idiot, delete that post"* kept running through my mind.   I didn't delete my post though. Truth was, I really couldn't -- this is the part where I apologize to the ROAP community for not being entirely truthful; my request said we had an alternate dinner if the pizza didn't work out, but that was just because I didn't want to be one of those sob story posts, even if I actually had a sob story. We had generic hotdogs and ramen as a plan b, and maybe I should just said that, but I didn't want anyone to feel like I was using my kids to manipulate my way to free pizza. Instead I just said in my post our week was bad, and boy was it, actually the whole summer was bad.   This summer my children's mother was caught stealing my pain medication by my 14 yr old daughter, which led to the revealing of her addiction and betrayals. Their mother promptly cleared out my bank account, left town and then pretty much cut us out of her life. She doesn't pay any support and she doesn't even contact the kids.  My youngest turned 10 last week and didn't get so much as a card from her mother. On top of all this I suffer from an auto-immune disease where my body destroys the soft tissue between my joints and spine and it has reached the point where I am disabled and must use a wheelchair for anything other than a trip to the bathroom. I cannot stand for more than a minute so I even have to use a special chair just to shower.   And the icing on the cake is; this week we got evicted and have 8 days to move out.  When I said we needed something to brighten our week I wasn't kidding.  Anyway, the reason I am telling you this after the fact is because I wanted to let the givers and mods know just how much these acts of kindness really mean to some of us. When Sierraechowhiskey sent me a generous gift card so that I could buy my kids their favorite kind of pizza and root beer for our movie night, it wasn't just the pizza that made me so happy -- it was that someone, anyone cared enough to go above and beyond to do something nice for us. It's cliché to say something like this restores your faith, but honestly in my case that was true.   As my kids were digging in to the pizzas and trying out the different toppings they'd each picked they were laughing and goofing off and...well, they were kids without a care in the world - and that is something I could't give them myself last night. That was what Sierraechowhiskey really gave my family last night; joy. Almost instantly a little party broke out and my kids were having a blast. Seeing them like that moved me to the point where...well, let's just say the pizza had A LOT of onions!    Every parent thinks their kids are amazing, but really you'll have to take my word for it; they are awesome kids. I have two girls and a boy (14, 10, 13) and I never need to ground them, they never cause trouble, they are kind-hearted and sweet and funny and smart and interesting and inquisitive. I love sitting and talking with them. They are so creative and talented and you'd never see that typical teenage "too cool for school" attitude from them. They clean their room and do their chores without asking and no matter how bad things get they never complain. They are the kind of kids that when there was only one piece of sausage pizza left last night, my son asked to make sure his sisters didn't want it before he took it. They deserve so much more than I can give them right now, but for one night we lacked for nothing, we had each other, a great movie, and delicious pizza sent by someone whose generosity made those pizza the best we've ever had.  So thank you Sierraechowhiskey and thanks you mods, and really thanks to everyone that gives and makes this community such an amazing place.  I am so grateful and inspired by you all. I don't have the money to pay it forward right now, but I do have other ways I can contribute and so as I move this week I will continue going through my things and trying to find items that match need posts over on r/assistance and r/favors. Between extra clothes and winter coats me and my kids no longer wear to things my ex doesn't want and some furniture and tech stuff I no longer need, I really hope that I can be a positive part of the community soon even if it's in small ways.  TL/DNR: Sierraechowhiskey is awesome and sometimes pizza makes me cry.  EDIT: Thanks everyone for your kind words and wishes! I was just going through some pictures and I came across two of my favorites, this one I took of my littlest after she danced around the backyard during a rain shower, http://i.imgur.com/hbiPX.jpg she's soggy but cute and the next one is with me and the kids http://i.imgur.com/M1pFg.jpg" huddled together.

I would like to use the verification system. If you don't know how to use it, you should probably figure it out.  Don't PM me first.

I'm stuck now at home with a massive sinus infection, and thanks to co-pays from my insurance I'm now left with a grand total of $49 in my bank account to get myself and my boyfriend through until next Friday (he doesn't work due to getting major dental surgeries done to fix abuse damage to his teeth, hasn't been able to get a job due to the extent of the damage).   Every cent of that remaining $49 has to go straight into my gas tank, because while I live in Pasadena I work all the way in Tarzana.   The cupboards are a bit bare, and while I feel bad turning here for a second time I could really use a little cheering up/something to alleviate the financial strain of feeding us both for a day or so...

t3_jyt6g	1314685400.0	luckytopher	pizza	[offer] A pizza, for you, but no sob stories please!	I was lucky enough to be gifted a pizza a few weeks back.  I could afford it, but I was upset due to a pending divorce and it was nice to have someone give a shit, someone that didn't even know me.  Reinforced my views on things.  So I promised I'd give back and now I'm going to.    My rules, because, hey, it's my pizza to give away, right?  * Leave a comment in this thread (duh) *  Tell me something interesting.  It can be a random fact.  It can be something neat you've done with your life.  Anything.  Anything EXCEPT a sob story.  I already gave mine and that's more than enough for the both of us, buddy. * Tell me what kind of pizza you like. * Tell me what kind of soda you like (particularly the kind that pizza guys deliver hint hint nudge nudge) * Please post a picture receiving/enjoying/munching.  It would not only make *ME* happy, but I know others enjoy seeing happy pizza-chowers, too.  I will be unavailable to do the actual gifting until Friday evening as my next few weekday nights are booked with work clients, and I don't want to leave anyone hanging or thinking I took off.  So I give you guys a couple of days to "enter" this "contest" and then the winner will get a pizza on Friday night (not a bad way to start a Friday, right?).  (FYI - winner will need to use verification system)  ***  EDIT (Friday): We have 2 winners!  I put numbers in a randomizer, then counted posts down that number of posts, and it gave me HTP5's post, but then I was also intrigued by danrick's so I decided to give out two of them.  Both of you PM me your verification code and let's get you some pizzzaaaaaa!	True
t3_jyitj	1314664707.0	tromboneham	FAP	[Offer] US, Contest! Drawing poorly for pizza.	I posted this really really late last night, and I don,'t think many people saw it. So far only three entrants. As I didn't actually get the check I was hoping for, I have to extend this another day anyway, so I'm going to repost.  Copy/paste: I was lucky (or stupid enough) to win a contest a week or so ago, and now I'm expecting a rather large check today, so I can finally return the favor.  &nbsp;   Prefacing this contest with this: I have no real artistic skills beyond playing my instrument. I can't draw anything decent to save my life. As such, I'm requesting you make some sort of art, and trust me, it can be god-awful. I like to laugh, I'm a fan stick figures. Rage comics are boring, don't do that.  &nbsp;  Only rules: Needs to relate to two photos, and have either my username or yours with the submission.   &nbsp;  First photo: [Myself, in China, doing what I do for a living.](http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/s720x720/189442_747909007567_37606829_38879036_447129_n.jpg)  Second photo: [My kick-ass dog.](http://i.imgur.com/tFcPV.jpg)  &nbsp;  In theory, this will be for Monday evening, after I get back from classes (7 pm est). There's a chance the direct deposit on my check won't go through until Tuesday, so the ending time is a bit open-ended.  &nbsp;  With that said, make me laugh. I'm going to bed now, but I will see every submission. The amount of upvotes you get really has no bearing other than other people liking it, so please, if you see your fellow-contest-entrants with something funny, upvote it. I'm going to post the three that already posted. If I still don't get my check tomorrow, I got a small refund from my previous cable supplier today, I'll just use that.  Not at all ending this, but I'm definitely buying a pizza for prances_with_pantses, because I am for sure making that my phone's background. Keep submitting, I'll pick another (or two more) tomorrow  **Last Edit, for Now: Unfortunately I won't be able to help out more people today. When I do get my check (the department of Ed is so damn slow) I'll be contacting some people through PM's if they're still in need. Thank you everyone for the submissions, I laughed at every one of them, promise. Hopefully it'll be sooner I can hook some of you up rather than later. Until then, I wish you good luck in your pizza hunting.**	True

t3_jxwbn	1314620499.0	Collaterlie_Sisters	PIF	[Request] Stuck in bed (UK), broken and hungry (WARNING: Self-inflicted)	I went to a BBQ on Saturday and lost my shit. Jager happened and I spent 3 hours playing tug-of-war with my boss' dog, several hours got absorbed by the sponge of drunk and I ended up with war-wounds similar to that of Arnie at the end of Terminator 2. Yesterday was a blur of hangover and today I woke up to find I can barely move to get to the bathroom. My back is covered in scratches, I can't bend my knees, I've lost the ability to look up, both my armpits are bruised... the list goes on.  Would anyone be in the mood to donate me pizza? I'd be most grateful, and would show this appreciation by making the painful journey to my front door to collect it. Then I will make sure I promptly return to my bed to let you know how delightful it tastes.  **EDIT:** Although I didn't get pizza due to my country being frigid with its online pizza ordering, I did have some lovely conversation and my aches and pains feel so much better now :) Thanks to all those who replied.

t3_jxogy	1314594481.0	Stalked_Like_Corn	pizza-gold	[Offer] And what an offer it is!	*edit*  **Offer has now expired as it is 12pm.  Those who have won have been notified.  I will be sending out coupon codes to those who have verified as soon as i possibly can.  I do have errands to run so if you get it back within the next 15 minutes you will get it sooner then later.  The lucky recipients are:**  * Superfiedman * KaziArmada * mandamoolah * nathanbucher * moodmuzik * Insanire  "But, Corn, that's less then 10! Why didn't I win!?"  Simply put there were other factors, that I won't disclose, that were considered and unfortunately if you didn't get one, I am sorry and hope that everyone understands.  **end edit**   A few things, first, i will be using verification system to weed out the scammers as much as possible.  I want to hear why you need a pizza.  This is based on need only please, not want for the sake of want.  I've been very fortunate lately and I have enough to fulfill numerous requests.  I ask people vote on the ones they feel deserve it most and i'll want some sort of a verification.  Show me a negative bank balance, a 2 month past due electricity bill, something to show you're having a difficult time.  If you're in school show me that you just bought tuition and books for like thousands of bucks.  I ask that you not make them into novella's as I can't read all that.  You don't have to post proof unless I ask for it in PM.  Again i'll be using verification and oh, if you've given pizza and have the icon i'll be giving you extra consideration.  Basically i'm going to pick the top 10 people i feel need it the most.  Others can comment with votes on why they think the person needs it the most as well.  I will check back tomorrow (monday) at approximately 11am to noon EST to sift through the people and pick the lucky 10.  All that I ask in return is that you let the mods know i sent and you post pictures of the pretty pizzas (and what you got on them, i am always curious).  Thanks for reading, good luck and post you stories.  	True

Congratulations to travio with his incredibly sexist and offensive submission:  travio A man walks into a bank and says to the teller "I want to open a motherfucking checking account." The teller is shocked and tells him "Please watch your language sir or i will have to get my manager." He replies "Lady I don't care about your manager.

I just won $20 million in the fucking lottery and I want to open a motherfucking checking account." The manager points to the teller and says "is this bitch giving you trouble?"  thanks to everyone who submitted jokes I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I'll definitely do something similar soon.	True
t3_jwe1j	1314477337.0	MrDannyOcean	shroom	[Request] Bought a pizza, now I could use one	A couple months ago I bought a pizza for a friend on another site.  I don't have any verification, but I hope you can trust I wouldn't lie over a 10 dollar transaction.  I'm fairly poor in grad school, but this guy had cash flow problems and deserved a break.  Right now, I could use a pizza because I have some serious cash flow problems.  My wife and I just paid for both of our grad school bills, and while we have some support from our university, it's monthly support.  What that means is that we just emptied our accounts to pay the bill, but our support comes a little bit at a time throughout the year.  The first installment won't get here until 9/2 or 9/3 and we could really use a pizza.  Long run, we should be perfectly fine, but right now we've barely got enough money to pay our rent on the first.  I plan on repaying reddit's kindness when I'm able to later this semester.    Thanks,  Danny  Edit:  Living in Athens, GA right now.  	True
t3_jw9qj	1314468515.0	Dirk_Hardpec	PIF	[Request] Always wanted to try out RaoP (Seaside, CA)	So i've been a redditor for a little over a month now and just stumbled upon this subreddit and found it very interesting. I'd like to get tangled up in this pizza awesomeness and truly find out how Random acts of Pizza actually works. Upon receiving my pie i will of course pizza it forward and treat someone else to a Random act of Pizza!  Ps. If you could get the pizza guy to draw the reddit alien on the box, mucho props and photos will ensue Pps. I have no sob story, I'm just a guy enjoying his day off from work ~~waiting to say "Booya!" to my girlfriend when she wakes up and I tell her reddit got us pizza for lunch before she goes to work at 1PST.~~  Sincerely, Dirk_Hardpec 	True
t3_jw2ig	1314448618.0	Androecian	shroom	[REQUEST] Bellevue, WA - Broke, studying to be work-at-home medical transcriptionist, been on EBT (food, not cash) for 2+ yrs. $200/mo for food (not withdrawable as cash) IS NOT enough to live on. Plus rant about my situation. Sorry.	Background: 26/m, 27 in October. I think it's safe to say that I'm shit at this life thing.  My last two jobs were three years ago, part time, just above WA minimum wage. I think it was 8.50/hr and 30-35 hrs/week for the first, and Saturdays 9/hr 9A-6P for the second. Even then I could only pay *half* of the rent for the 100-sq-ft bedroom in the all-other-amenities-shared house two blocks from my bio-mother and stepfather's *huge* house that I couldn't stand to be in at the time (because I wasn't making as much as I wanted to be making, and the prospect of ~50 hours a week in retail still gives me the reversed-Yao-Ming "gaaah!" face) and I still can't stand it there. It's rich, it's froofroo, and I am comfortable being less so - but not *this* much less so.  I think I may have a serious social anxiety problem.  I grew up socializing on the Internet - not needing to speak, just to read and type and laugh at funny things and look for the next distraction. Pry me away from a computer and away from people online who I don't have to know unless I choose to, and I can't talk casually unless it's about something I like and am hoping someone else likes so I don't end up wasting our collective time.  I'm in the middle of a hy-uge Venn diagram of subsets of society known for being reclusive and abnormal - I'm a nonvisibly disabled, high-functioning Aspie, not straight, an atheist, a geek, a furry [mostly on TapestriesMUCK], I get off on BDSM [see previous], I overshare and awkward the hell out of the place in an effort to feel comfortable around people I don't know... - and some days I do nothing more than wake up in the afternoon and browse politiblogs and Reddit and sneak out for errands (food, cleaning supplies when I can afford them, mail-in ballots which *should be less expensive* when you have to save every damn cent) and I sneak right back. I am nobody. You never see me. It took me a few months of being on the nicest fucking subreddits on here, r/trees and r/mylittlepony and a lot of their spinoffs, in order to open up to where I'm commenting semiregularly enough that my karma is over 1100 for the first time in *two years.* Thank you, bronies and ents. In the words of Fluttershy: you rock. Woohoo. In the words of Bloomberg, the best ent in Ponyville: nothing. It's an apple tree, for buck's sake.  Back to why I think I could really use a pizza.  I've had not very much luck adjusting to life on my own. Being on EBT is ...nice, I can make it work, but it's not enough to live on forever - which is probably the point. EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer, I think?) is like a food-stamps account in card form, set up between some big chain-bank and the Dept of Social Health Services, and refilled $200 a month for groceries - and also $100 for cash, which would solve my problem entirely, *BUT* I stopped getting it after I had nothing to say at the stupid useless awkward goddammitsomuch DSHS counselor meetings because I hadn't been successful at finding work.  Rent is handled with a Section 8 voucher (WHICH FUCKING RULES BTW) but the intermediary program I'm with, Porchlight (who handle things between Sec8 and KCHA, the King County Housing Authority) covers 60%-70% of the rent and someone else has to cover the rest. That someone is currently bio-Dad. Love you, Dad. I'm trying.  But until I finish this goddamn medical transcription course - CareerStep, careerstep.com, awesome legit work-at-home courses in lots of medical fields (billing, coding, MT, etc.), certificate's yours if you have $1000, a year to work through it, and an Internet connection - I have to deal with goddamn EBT for the foreseeable goddamn future, and that's goddamn depressing.  A lot of my life has been handled by other people behind the curtains, and I just never asked what I needed to do. I really should have. Never been to a Home Ec class, but I can follow package directions for cooking. I don't know about finances, and I used to think balancing a bank account was like a "number line" from high school algebra - balance it at the middle, not positive, not negative, zero. I want to be fucking done with this course and have a job and enough food to last more than three weeks before I need to resort to ramen and ricearoni and dollar-a-can condensed soup. I want to be secure enough in myself not to feel like crying just for sharing embarrassing and true things online to people I'll never otherwise know.  I have never more in my life wanted to tell a Redditor why I would really like them to buy me pizza over the Internet. It seems like such a simple and fulfilling thing to do. It's so crazy, it just might work.  Also - if there's any subreddits you fine upstanding gentlemen and -women could point me to, where I could find common ground with people-who-like-things-I-mention-above, that would be very much appreciated. Even if it's r/psychoanalysis (does that exist?) or, I'm not really near this desperate but I could use a little feel-like-I'm-important reassurance, r/suicidewatch...  I want not to feel like a chooser instead of a beggar just because I'd like a larger size of random-pizza, but even if it's a personal-pan or whatthehellever I'll enjoy it. I guess in the end it's up to you. I don't even know you, and I trust you like family. Is that stupid of me?  **tl;dr** I waste your time explaining why I would like a very simple reward for making it this far in life even though it still doesn't seem like much from here. Please read. I put a lot of work and thought into explaining myself. I cried while typing this. Over *pizza.* Yes, it would mean this much to me.  I love you people. Every one of you. Even broinbromine, just to spite him.  EDIT: Just realized I don't know how to send a PM. Tell me how in comments? Or in a PM, then I could just reply with my address I guess... [fingers crossed]  **EDIT:** I'm feeling much better than I was this morning. The pizza is fantastic, the salad is awesome, and [puremorning1](http://www.reddit.com/user/puremorning1) is a very very worthwhile person.	True

I'm currently trying to save up money to pay forward my generous pizza gift from a month ago. We are really struggling with food and would like a decent meal.  Feel free to read my past request. I will give you any details you would like. I'm just looking for some help to get through this hard time. I don't like to be so persistent but we really do need some help.

t3_jvdrr	1314384414.0	worriedgrandma	pizza-gold	smiles for my grandbabies	REQUEST      Allow me to introduce the Ramirez family: John Ramirez a 41 year old father with five children still in school. Twin girls Juana and Viviana 15 year old sophomores at Southwest High School, Mario a 13 year old eigth grader at McCollough Middle school, Roman a 7 year old third grader at Hidden Cove Elementary and the youngest Liliana a 5 year old kindergardener at Hidden Cove Elementary. His partner and mother of his two youngest children and stepmother raising all of his kids is Elizabeth is 26.  On Thursday July 21, 2011 John went to the Santa Rosa Hospital downtown for what was thought to be a routine issue from his diabetes and was subsequently diagnosed with Acute Lymophatic Lukemia Stage 4. This family was shaken to the core with the news. They have begun Chemotherapy and the family goes daily to the hospital but the cost of gas,oil etc... and keeping their old van running and still having the normal bills has drained them.  I ask today for prayers for this family and for those of you who are able, a donation to help get the school kids ready for the upcoming school year and to help this family meet their needs, and for final expenses should the outcome be fatal. The family is near Walmart, HEB, Family Dollar, Dollar General and tries to shop economically.

t3_jv8lb	1314375663.0	hippymatt	shroom	[Offer] Pizza'ing it Forward, As Promised... North Texas...	A couple of weeks ago, NY_epigenes answered my pizza prayers on the pretense that when the money came back in that I would pay it forward. I'm sad to say I haven't hit it rich just yet, but I do have a few extra bucks after paying tuition.  Anybody out there really hankering for a 'za but can't get it themselves?   EDIT: The Pizza has been forwarded! I wish I was loaded and could hook everybody up but alas, I'm as broke as us all... Happy hunting pizza bros...	True
t3_jutej	1314334403.0	downvotesreposts	pizza	[offer] Requesters, it's your turn to give a pizza to someone.	Requesters,  I find it impossible to decide who to give a pizza to this evening- you all seem like fine recipients!  So, I was hoping you could help me out and recommend a fellow requester to receive a gift card.  Just post a link to their request and tell me why they should be the one.  Then I'll pick a recipient, and you'll have given them a pizza by proxy.  It will be a bit of an experiment, so my apologies in advance if this process sucks in some unforeseen way.   update- my daughter demands I play legos with her.  I'll check back in about half an hour and see if any consensus has begun to develop :)  update 2- Ok, so I've learned that this process didn't really make it any easier to pick who should get a pizza.  Oh well!  So, how about one for Meowschwitz123 and one for Zhennlash?  update 3- Ok, gift cards ordered for Meowschwitz123 and one for Zhennlash.  Thanks everyone, it was fun!  Sorry for those I didn't get; good luck with your requests.	True

t3_juo1u	1314323703.0	polarbear_15	shroom	[Request] Pizza Hut screwed me last time I accepted an offer.	I accepted a pizza a few days ago, but Pizza Hut wouldn't give it to me without the cardholder present so my friend offered to scrounge up some change to pay for it. I'm not starving or anything, but we're somewhat broke (too broke to eat delicious fast food very often anyways) and looking for jobs. No sob story, food is just one of my favorite things in life and nearly nothing beats a hot pizza. I'm in Tucson, AZ.  **EDIT: Never mind! jimwil gave me a gift card [over here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jupq2/request_p/) Go give him some love!**	True
t3_jumg2	1314320434.0	lasvegasnv11	lasvegas	[offer] Pizza because I feel guilty	Living in Las Vegas can get very expensive if youre a gambling addict. I just got a HUGE check and wasted over half of it at the tables. I couldve bought a new car with what I wasted, which makes me feel guilty because Las Vegas has more homeless people than probably anywhere else. So, to make myself feel better, I'm buying pizzas for people who need it. So, if youre down on your luck and need food, tell me here. Please dont PM me unless I ask so that I dont get 50-60 PMs in my inbox. Ive also been a part of this site long enough that I know about fakes and scams so if I feel youre a scammer, please dont be mad if I ask for some sort of proof.  Edit: This thread is almost 24 hours old, but I'm still sending pizzas. 	True

t3_ju26j	1314283602.0	capitalb620	FAP	[REQUEST] Today was my little girl's 1st day of Kindergarten. Would love to surprise her with some pizza (her favorite food) when she gets home this afternoon.	Hey, RAOP, this isn't really a sob story or anything like that, but the title pretty much says it all. Her mom took her out for her favorite breakfast this morning before meeting me at the school, so I'd like to surprise her with her favorite dinner after school. (I was a delivery guy here for a while, so she developed quite the affinity for it.) The downside is payday is tomorrow. Nobody is going to go hungry or anything, I just thought it would be a nice (random) treat.   Here's a picture of her this morning after having a few too many pictures taken:http://imgur.com/1V8gr  And one of me with her outside the school:http://imgur.com/VWe5f  Pizza or no, its been a fun day so far, and if you even bothered to read this, then thank you. Have a good one, RAOP.  **EDIT: Taken care of thanks to unmoderated! Thanks again!**  **EDIT Numero Dos: Wow, that's a lot of upslices. Thanks guys. I'll update with a couple more pics soon. In the meantime, help some of these other fine folks.**  **EDIT THE THIRD: Pizza Time! She was so excited.

t3_js156	1314127890.0	shhhXdontXtell	PIF	[Request] heat index is 101, ac is out Kansas City, MO	Still not a need but it would be devoured and appreciated. The temperature is 92 with a heat index of 101(as of 2:30pm). Im applying deodorant like it can save my life. All windows are open, the fans we have are on. Around 7 it usually cools down some(yesterday is was 84 at 11pm though). Id love to be able to eat a hot meal withouit having to cook it and warm the house up more. There are 4 of us. We have papa johns and pizza hut close by but prefer papa johns. We usually get 2 mediums(the deal ends up being about $16) and that would do. My daughter gets home from school after 4 so pizza sometime after that would be great. Id gladly pay this forward on my birthday (September 3rd).   My RAoP history: This is my 2nd request. The last one went unanswered(not complaining). I did win a contest ReillyBoy put on and with his permission passed that pizza on to a friend of mine who is a single father and was living on ramen at the time.   Edit: [Its now 6pm and the temp is 91.9 with a heat index of 100. Humidity is at 51%](http://i.imgur.com/ARtIt.jpg) its a sweat fest here but Ill need to begin dinner soon. The girl goes to bed at 8:30, its a school night.  Edit again: going to make dinner. Its too late to order in time for her to eat with us. Thanks anyway, guys.  Edit part trois: thank you jimwll(I think) and Elysianbtrfly for passing this along. Will post pix when we use this.	True

t3_jrysw	1314124704.0	Deleccles	shroom	[Request] Hungry girl in the UK	First off, I will admit I am new, and I made my account after discovering this subreddit.  But I have been a lurker for quite a while and have even gotten my mum addicted to this site (and the aww sub).   Right now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.  I don't think it's fair to people, especially if they think I'm only after pity.  But I will explain some, at least that's connected to why I'm in this situation.  Otherwise, what's the point?   My baby sister died when she was barely out of her teens.  I was still a teen myself at the time, and my mum took it very badly.  I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.   I do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.   I'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.    I don't know what kind of proof you could ask for about me.  But please feel free to ask away and I will try my best to verify anything.  Unless you want a picture of me.  That's just wrong.  And evil.  And....wrong :)  Edit: Forgot to include [request] doh	True

t3_jrr7j	1314113029.0	DEStudent	PIF	Have a little Faith... A special thank you to marx1st!	So I made a request last night. I was honest- I received before, I burnt meatloaf and my IBS was flaring. And I know how some of us are- we're naysayers. Sometimes we get so tired of the beggers, we become cold and callous. And sometimes there are trolls and spammers. But I want to remind us all to have little faith. I got a PM saying the person saw my request and wanted to get me a pizza. I submitted all my info and verification. This kind soul was in the process of asking what I wanted and then said she was going to send me a gift card instead. I thanked her and waited and checked my email and spam and no giftcard. I sent her a few messages after an hour noting the problem and that I hadn't received anything. No messages back. It was late and I laid down. I still hadn't received anything. I didn't get angry or upset. So after I woke up later this morning, I was going through my emails that came in, while I was asleep. And TaDa! I had a gift card from **marx1st!**  I want to thank her so much for her kindness and generosity but also to remind us all- sometimes we need to have a little faith. That's for the givers and receivers. **Not everyone is out to scam especially those who received more than 1x.** Sometimes a person is just really in a bad situation. And for the receivers, be honest, be patient and remember no one here owes you **Anything!** Its up to the donor to decide what criteria they want to use. Thank you **marx1st** in more ways than you know. You just never know who's life you may be effecting-just by offering a pizza. I love you all RAOP and I will be *paying it forward* next month. Please make sure marx1st gets her icon because she really deserves it!   *Edit*- Here's the link to my Pizza Feast   http://s1229.photobucket.com/albums/ee478/RMS913/	True

I'm a graduate student, so I'm still not loaded, but if there is anyone out there who could really use the help - especially someone with kids - I'd love to lend a hand.    EDIT: I just mention that I've been poor in the past as a way of saying I empathize. I'm able to pay my bills fine now, and I'm interested in helping those who cant.

t3_jr50s	1314058823.0	DEStudent	PIF	Requesting a Pizza but I've received Before	I don't want to make up some sob story, I just would like a pizza. Burnt meatloaf and my IBS is acting up. Pizza would cheer me up. I'm broke and I have 38 cents in my account. I know there's lots of scammers, but I'm not one of them. I'm just a broke Psychology student. I can verify if needed. Sincerely: DEStudent *edit- someone has been kind enough to help me-Thank you all!* 	True
t3_jr1lq	1314051776.0	BigPlunk	shroom	[Request]Vancouver, BC, Canada Father of 5, wife just got out of surgery, we were suddenly cut off from employment insurance.	The government screwed up and now we have to wait over a month for them to refile and reestablish my claim.  There is no way to expedite this at all, in spite of the fact that it is their mistake.  We have 2 girls (9 and 7) and 3 boys (5,3, 2months).  My wife had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital last week for emergency gall bladder removal surgery and we are feeling a bit beat on at the moment.  This would be a humungous pick-us-up.  I am happy to provide any verification you need.  Thanks in advance.  **EDIT: http://imgur.com/4FXXT Thank you so much Gama-Go!**	True
t3_jqqzt	1314033378.0	BlackLeatherRain	FAP	[REQUEST] Winston Salem, NC - I f'd up dinner, royally.	Really, I spent ALL NIGHT last night working on red beans and rice - and when I say ALL NIGHT, I mean that I went to bed at seven in the morning.  My husband and I are separated as of this past Friday, and this has been my first weekend alone (ever - I've always lived with someone since childhood).  This hasn't been nearly as terrifying as I'd anticipated, however...  My meals for the week were going to be surrounded by the idea of a big assed pot of Red Beans and Rice.  Yes, I've never cooked this before, but how hard can it be?  I soaked the beans overnight, rinsed them, brought them to a boil then took them to a simmer and added rice.  I sauteed onions, the last of my linked sausage and bacon, and simmered.  I simmered for *hours.*  Currently what I have is sausage-smellin' gruel (really, it does smell good) punctuated with rock hard little red beans.  It's infuriating, and I can't figure out how to salvage it.  In addition to that, this was supposed to be dinner and lunch until I get paid on Friday.  Luckily, I bought a couple dozen eggs and I have milk for protein shakes!  That will last me a bit.  So, I'm here at RAOP not because I'm the neediest person here, but because my day is going to be spent moving furniture (HEAVY furniture) up steps, dismantling things and then putting them back together, and putting this house into a semblance of order before I return to work on Wednesday.  A pizza would go a long way to keeping me fed and energized while getting shit done, and hell... it would just make me feel good.  I'm not the neediest person in the room, I have no kids, I can give you pictures of my cat(s) and even the absolute wreck that is my basement, but I would be terribly appreciative and you can be assured that I will pay it forward again when my future stabilizes a bit, likely towards the end of next month.  For your patience in reading my ramblings, here's a picture of a stormtrooper dancing, which helped me cheer up after my cats locked themselves into my bedroom last night: http://i.imgur.com/lpPa5.gif  **Edit:** I did get an offer, but unfortunately once the giver received my street and email address, their account was deleted and I haven't heard a lick since.  It was worth a shot, right? :D	True
t3_jqp40	1314029876.0	creativetm	shroom	[request] trying one more time (troy, mi - usa)	I tried this a few days ago, but we came to no avail. So I'll try one last time:  Original Post:  "So, my little sister and I are stuck at home for the night while our parents are out of town. We're really hungry, and we just finished the last box of Frosted Flakes (FML).   To be honest, we could probably get the bus to take us to the nearest gas station (as I don't have much money), but some real food would be nice.  Please Reddit, somebody help us! :'(  http://imgur.com/X6k1q"  The circumstances have actually changed a bit, though. My sister and I are at home alone, again. And we're still so hungry. The reason we don't have anything to eat is that we just rented out a new house, and we're living here while we move the rest of everything here. So, please, someone; help us! :(	True
t3_jq9rp	1313987322.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	Thoughts on giving and finding recipients	A growing problem here seems to be how to find people to give to who are less likely to be scammers.   I've been thinking for awhile (and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jpkje/whats_your_personal_fuck_my_life_story/) helped cement the thoughts) that perhaps we could search outside of RAoP for recipients. Find somone on reddit that looks like they need cheering up, contact them and point them to the fact that you're from RAoP and offer them a pizza (if they meet criteria, etc). Posting could still be done on RAoP announcing the gift, etc. Details to be sorted out by someone with more time.  It's just an idea - what do people think?  **Edit:** As pointed out by meteorliath, this would be in addition to, not instead of the current set up in RAoP. 	True

t3_jphkx	1313909918.0	zombiechow	FAP	[Thank you] If life existed as it does on Reddit.....(Posted earlier on /r/Self)	Everybody would have a cat, bathe with ice soap, and carry a portable troll face in their pocket. Everybody would have access to amazing low cost education, Fox News wouldn't exist, and Conan O' Brien would be our awesome ginger president.  Joking aside, this community amazes me.  I started reading Reddit over a year ago as a late night thing I did before bed. While initially I thought it was nothing more than /b with a touch of class, I quickly learned that this was not the case.  Redditors do amazing things every day for so many people and it's touching. Between the amazing push for donations at donorschoose.org, providing advice and sometimes solving problems for people who have been wronged, and feeding people who don't have the means to do it for themselves. A few days ago, I was directly effected by the Reddit community.  I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but a Redditor over at /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza completely changed my view and prospective on life. Here's why.  I'm a Biology student working my way up to medical school where I want to become a Neurologist. I was broke, got laid off from my job, and recently lost my apartment. I didn't have money for food and at that point, had not eaten in a little over 2 days. I couldn't even afford a 6 pack of Ramen noodles which I had been religiously eating for several weeks.  Enter Random Acts of Pizza which I discovered from a Reddit ad. I was tired, hungry, depressed, and simply didn't want to leave my bed. I don't like charity but was desperate and posted topic requesting a pizza. Within an hour or so, redditor srinuv (I hope he won't mind me using his name here) messaged me with an offer to buy me a pizza and even offered to help me out way beyond what I ever expected from a stranger.  Several hours later I received my pizza with a bonus of breadsticks and a coke. It was the best meal of my life.  I've battled with severe depression since my late teens. Most of the time it's well under control, but it was very bad for a long time leading to numerous suicide attempts. Laying in my bed, hungry, depressed, recently evicted, I felt myself slipping back down into the abyss and a silly little pizza changed all of that. I woke up the next morning feeling great and with a renewed sense of purpose. Everything was going to be ok.  It's amazing how something so small can improve somebodies outlook on life. If you haven't already, please consider heading over to /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/ say hi, offer words of encouragement, or even better to donate a pizza to a needy person or family. In many cases you're doing more than just feeding peoples bellys.....you're renewing their spirits.  I hope to pay it forward sometime soon. Thank you again, srinuv and to all of the other redditors who have sent me messages wishing me good luck.	True

High bills this month and a car accident have cost me a lot of money, plus the gas use from having like 4 appts with the doctor and oncology(both about 30 min away) have drained my acct to about 2 dollars.

I can't say first-come-first-served because I want to check people out to make as sure as I can that they're legit. I may ask for your Facebook name so I can see if you actually go to college...I mean, what college student doesn't have a facebook? I don't need you to friend me, I just want to use Facebook's ability to make sure you've got a college address.  **Edit: OK, I sent a PM to LaserCow for this week's pizza.

We will judge and award by Friday, Aug 19, 12:00 PST. edit: this is a PIZZA gift card! yum  EDIT: Hi All! First off, thanks so much to everyone for participating, it was great to see all the wonderful doodles. It was a really tough decision, but after much deliberation the top prize goes to johansrobot - because I adore The Brave Little Toaster. (shut up, you stoopid blanket!) On a more somber note - this was Reilly's last contest. Due to some very unfortunate BS on another subreddit - he has chosen to pack up and leave. This saddens me greatly, and my hope is that people remember all the generosity that he shared, and next time think twice before shitting on someone.	True

t3_jmsi7	1313679768.0	NYGalz	pizza-gold	I have a unusual [request.] 	My daughter is involved with her high school marching band. They have camp this week and next from 12-9 M-F. These kids have been and will continue to work their butts off. They have spent these hours outside in the heat and in periods of rain in order to get their show ready. They will perform at our football games and compete in competitions. I can't stress how hard these kids work.   Running these shows takes not only work from the kids but a lot of of money, we are estimating this year to spend over $10,000 on equipment, supplies and show fees, etc.   Now to my request, I would like to reward the hard working kids to a pizza dinner next Friday (8/26). We have over 60 kids and 10 staff members who really deserve a reward. If anyone would be willing to donate Pizza Huts gift cards to help make this happen, I would really appreciate it.   I am off to help with camp and will not be back online until about 10.00 PM EST so I will check back than.   Thanks in advance. :-)   EDIT - We are in Pennsylvania  Edit 2 - We have to do MAJOR fundraising and ask for donations in order to keep our  program running. Each child is responsible for a commitment fee and also asked to help with fundraising. NO we are not rich, we have about 5-6 hardship cases every year that as an organization we have to take as a loss and need to make up the funds else where.  	True

t3_jlv78	1313606891.0	shhhXdontXtell	PIF	[Request] celebrating a great 1st day of Kindergarten in the KC,MO area	This is completely not a need by any means.

t3_jlj01	1313583833.0	6995	shroom	[Request] Enable me to be a lazy bitch and not cook dinner tonight.	Single Mom here. So, my oldest is almost 9. She came down with strep three days after school started back. Yay. =\ Had a semi stressful weekend with trying to keep her and my youngest (almost 11 months) apart so the youngest wouldn't get infected too. However, the baby woke me up at 2am yesterday morning with a faucet for a nose and a slight cough. Called the doctor to see if that warranted a visit, and low and behold it does. She was also positive for strep. She's a really good baby though, and except for being off her bottle (I guess the sucking hurts?) a little bit, and hating to have her nose wiped, she's dealing amazingly well.   So to sum it up, I've got two sick kids and I'm behind on household chores (anyone got a laundry fairy they can spare??) and I'd really just like a night off from cooking dinner. I'm not desperate for food, and I totally understand if there are others who are and you'd rather help them.   We're in Metro Atlanta, and are happy with any of the three major chains, but we also have Hungry Howies and Bucks pizza who both have online ordering. My oldest only eats cheese, and I'll take any meat product on the other side. Allergies to mushrooms, so please none of those. :)   I hope that's enough info.. but if not, feel free to ask me anything. :)  EDIT: OMG. Thank you so much JimWill. You are the awesomest. :) 	True

t3_jkra8	1313521811.0	Stonecipher	shroom	[Request] Temporarily Poor and Could Use a Pizza	I cannot prove that I have no money in my bank account because I have no bank account.  I cannot prove that I am unemployed because I cannot collect unemployment as I voluntarily quit my job in order to move to Colorado.  I cannot prove that my girlfriend also has no job and that between us we currently have nothing other than her new grad school debt and a small box of cash.  Until next week, we don't have anything from her loan and the 30 singles and one $20 bill in the box is all we have to live off of.  Also, I am stealing an internet signal, which is fading in and out and really getting quite annoying, but I can't even really afford to put gas in the car and go sit in a coffee shop in order to get some wifi.  So, while this crappy picture of the cash box is all the proof I have, just know that it took me 37 minutes to post it.  I am committed and hungry: http://i.imgur.com/hJ3FX.jpg    By the way, don't worry about the red pepper flakes, we've got that covered, but some Parmesan cheese on the side would be a huge plus.  Thanks for considering me and I promise to return the favor as soon as I can get a job.  EDIT: Removed my completely incorrect use of the term "Pay it forward".  EDIT 2:  Thanks RAOP!  You guys are awesome!  I have a pizza on the way from crashin, this is really a big help to us right now, and a really pleasant treat.  Everyone say thanks to crashin for me.

So you don't like the fact that someone is new, or has a sob story and then decide that person is not worthy. Well thats not fair. I put in 2 request, offered to pay it forward, and got no help just because a few redditors decide that I am not up to their standards. Well I have news for you, my story is leggit and I do have children and a dog, and as a matter of fact I started my new job today, though it was only 4 hours of orientation and filling out paperwork. the fact is that being hateful can hurt people. I know there are people on here who make up stories, but I also know that people like me and my family really are hurting. In fact we only ate once yesterday and I have not eaten at all today. but I'm sure you dont want to hear my sob story about that. Just think next time before you are so quick to judge someone. maybe one day you might find yourself hungry and would not want someone to judge you. EDIT: This is only my opinion on my experience here on RAOP Your opinion and your experience may differ. I did not Mean for this to become a bitchfest Nor did I mean for this to offend anyone. I was just mearly pointing out the fact that some people have no idea what a person is really going thru and should not be so quick to judge as some people really are Hungry and do need help with food, etc....

They'll have to scrounge off the rest of you like the helpless babes they are.  But I'll accept grannies and grandpas if they're over and visiting.  Other conditions may apply:  * You must have >500 karma on reddit.  That's where you spend all your time after all. * The teenager must be the owner of the reddit account.

The 500 karma point condition *may* be flexible if you seem extra likeable, but not **that** flexible  PPS. Previous pizza winners ARE eligible for this pizza.   	True

t3_jhqi5	1313250283.0	badbrownie	brownie	Suggestion/Question: Can we see the town/city of the requester when entering their verification code?	the IP address check is a great idea but is relatively easily circumvented with various anonymizing tools.  However, what those tools can't do is come up with a fake IP that is in their own town (and be definition, they wouldn't want to).  So - how about we add an extra line to the verification page that shows the town/city of the IP address to shave off one extra layer of scamming scum.	True

t3_jhc9n	1313199976.0	warfrogs	FAP	[Request] Will pay it forward when my new card arrives.  Western Minneapolis Suburbs (MN)	**EDITx2: ReillyBoy is my own personal hero of all redditors.  So in PM, he asks me what I would like and whereabouts I am.  I tell him the location and then say something along the lines of "just a thin crust with extra cheese would be awesome... chicken and bacon if possible...." **  **He responds a bit later, telling me they had some troubles at the place and that I needed to post pics of what I ended up getting.  i laughed but was really grateful i was getting something that would be hot and delicious.  I'm grateful enough that I figure I'll do what he asks and take a picture of the Dominos he got the order placed for me.  I had meant to take a picture of the Dominos guy holding up the pizza he got for me, but instead I'm greeted by 2 large pizza boxes and a bread side box- my jaw drops, I sign the slip for the gift card order, take the pizzas, mumble thanks, and step outside completely in shock.  I'm not kidding that if I wasn't so manly I sweat Brawndo and breathe straight nicotine smoke I would have cried... so maybe I did choke up a bit... BUT IT WAS MANLY DAMNIT.**  **[Enclosed are the pictures that he asked I post of my pizza.](http://imgur.com/a/YaFaI) (Sorry for the crappy quality of the exterior shot.  Dark outside and didn't want to seem SUPER weird by photographing the outside of a Dominos at night with a flash.... ANYWAYS... ) ReillyBoy, you are my reddit hero.  You are a benefit to everyone and a blessing to mankind.  Thank you so much my friend.**  *EDIT: It seems I will be fed shortly.  Expect to see me getting an offer up on here in a few days Reilly.  Thanks again man, you are my personal hero for the night.*  Hey guys, so I did something kind of stupid.  My debit card got damaged and I called in to request a replacement.  I told them that I didn't need a temporary card and could just wait until the new one arrived. Mistake number one.  Mistake number two was lending 20 bucks to a co-worker.  Mistake number three was not getting cash out FROM THE VERY BANK THAT I WORK AT.  So for tonight I am without food other than hot sauce and sour cream and it seems my existing debit card won't work for ordering pizza because my security code on the back of the card is different.  Anyone able to help me out?  I have a verification number and all that jazz, just need someone who can help me out until I get my new card!	True

Must have a place nearby where I can order online (Domino's, Papa Johns, etc.)  I will make my decision at 5p Eastern Time Today.  EDIT: Wow! I didn't think I was going to get this much attention. The stories were awesome! Unfortunately, I can really only afford three rewards. Valladian, kittyp123, and pookie85 check your inbox! :-)	True
t3_jh3fd	1313180138.0	meteorliath	frog	[Offer] US, $20 Domino's	so I tried to give away last night but the person never came back to collect, and the time before it was a country issue, which is fine.  This way I'm guaranteed to be able to give it away!    I don't feel like just using a random number generator or a guess number thing, instead I'll use what I like :)  I'm a super Doctor Who/ Torchword Fan, along with Supernatural (though I'm not happy with the latest season finale at all), and I'm a former UW Husky.  So for this all you have to do is either post your favorite moment/thing about those shows, or if you are/were a Husky, your favorite spot on campus and why.

t3_jgtfw	1313161992.0	r4v5	PIF	[Request] My waitress friend's broke and has no food 'til Monday. She's too proud to ask for help.	She lives in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, which hasn't been hit super hard by the recession but certainly isn't doing well. She works as a waitress for a restaurant that just opened, and it's not doing too well. It's looking like she's gonna be unemployed soon. She's down to a day a week, and unfortunately I'm not in a position to help her out with food. A random pizza will help her eat something other than the stale remains of a box of wheat thins til her boyfriend gets back home to her on Monday.  EDIT: Thank you so much, Reddit. You made her week for sure!	True
t3_jgoyj	1313150885.0	AskMeAboutUnicorns	pizza	I'm giving away some Domino's Pizza.  This evening. Please read before requesting.	I just got paid and I'm going to get pizza tonight, so I thought I'd give someone else pizza.  I know there are people here who try to scam, and others who are down on their luck.  Guess what?  I don't care.  You sob story me, you aren't getting a pie.  You aren't a true sports fan? HAH!  Your account is too young, no chance (and I don't care about your excuse).  I'm not an ass, but my brother gave yesterday and people got pissed because he gave to a guy who has gifted dozens of steam games to other redditors.  I don't care if you have 10 children, you shouldn't have given it up so easily.  I'm going to be giving a Dominos gift card to whoever wows me the most tonight at around 4 or 5.  There's a preseason game on tonight.  Guess right (or be a true fan, which is preferred though can't be easily sifted) and I'll have a better chance of choosing you.    When I come home from work, I will look through submissions and decide.  Best chance: don't be a dick, don't EVER whine about someone's financial situation, don't immediately ask for a PM, enjoy the team I like, and enjoy Pizza.  I'll PM one of you around 4 PM EST. Cheers.  EDIT:  OH!  Also, I'm a fucked up narcissist, so I would love a photo of you enjoying the gift.  That's not too much to ask right?  And if it's hilarious, I'm happier.  EDIT 2: HeeroJay broke the rules and provided a sob story (He or she's a Bills fan) but it was so funny that I decided to give the pizza card to him/her.  Thanks everyone for the great responses.  This was my first experience with RAOP and likely won't be my last.  Peace PepperBROnies!  EDIT 3: Also, I'm a Lions fan, if it wasn't painfully obvious.  Another one: I totally feel bad, HeeroJay waited patiently for his pizza while I fell asleep watching Futurama and forgot to phone in verify.  Well, don't I feel like a prick.  Either way, should be resolved now.  Edit again: [Mah boy HeeroJay enjoying his pizza](http://imgur.com/3QcAE.jpg)	True

t3_jfh9m	1313046936.0	lordlortnoc	PIF	[Request] Semi-Homeless Guy Looking for a Hot Meal	Well...  I'm 25, male...  I just moved to Winchester, Virginia from Dallas, Texas to help out my brother.  I should have stayed in Dallas.   A few months back he was going on and on about how his life sucks and that he was ready for a change, and that he was going to dump his good for nothing negative energy vampire girlfriend and start over, and that he needed some moral support to do so.  So I said alright man, I will be there in a month.  So I hop a plane with a few bags and go to this state that I've never even wanted to go to before to help out my brother.  After a month or two nothing had changed.  It's like he was like, lets drag him into this mess too...  I've been trying to save up to get an apartment and it's not working.  I work in retail and they are insisting on giving me anywhere from 4 hours to 20 hours a week, and I've been begging for more hours.  I love working there, but the hours are really killing me...  So anyways, my bro ends up getting all of us evicted and then abandons me in a town that I have no ties to anyone in...  I asked him so what comes next?  He responded,"Well we're going to go live with her aunt..."  and I'm just sitting there like,"okay, what the hell am i going to do?!"  He didn't even offer to help me move.  I asked him if he would be there to help me move the day before we where suppose to be out and he said he would, and I said that I was really counting on him cause I didn't know anyone,...  He never showed up or called, texted,...  nothing.  He still hasn't to this day.   I met this girl online that had a room to rent for $300 and I went to look at the room...  She didn't pick me for the room, but after I explained my situation to her she said I could store my stuff in the garage.  So everything that I own at the moment is in the garage of a random complete stranger that I met on Craigslist.  She's even been so kind as to let me sleep out there.     I have a homeless friend that I met before I was evicted, so I saw him sitting outside of Walmart and I said "guess what man?  I got evicted...  Now I'm homeless too..."  Which he responded "The whole world is your home now..." and he ended up giving me a tent in case the girl said I couldn't stay in the garage anymore...  along with a hiking backpack...  I'm not looking to get used to this.   You know you've hit an all time low when you're accepting gifts/housing from a homeless guy...  He hooked me up with a hobo hobby-kit...  :-)  I've been trying to keep a smile on my face and stay upbeat about everything that's being thrown at me.  It's been working so far, but it's starting to kinda get to me.   I also went by the food bank and they said there's nothing that they can do for me cause I have an out of state license and I hadn't received a bill for my cell phone before we where evicted, so I can't actually PROVE that I live here now, which I think is pretty friggin stupid.  If you need food, you need food...  am i right?  They did end up giving me a few things cause this lady standing there watching started yelling at them lol...  So they gave some bread and a few cans of soup to shut her up...  I was just going to turn around and walk off, I'm glad she was there.   The girl re-thought the situation and said that I could move in if I pay her $350 a month and move into the attic,...  Which is a hell of alot better than the garage, this heat is killing me.  I'm just waiting on her current roommate to move out this Saturday and then I can start moving in.  I get paid on Friday, it should be somewhere around $350 for 2 weeks, which is all going to go to her for half a month of rent and deposit...  So I'm pretty much going to be broke again, give or take $5.     Anything would help...  A pizza would go a long way in raising my spirits, and when I find a second job and get back to where I have a few bucks in my pocket I would love to pay it forward, 2 or 3 times.  I can't remember the last time I was this broke.  I'm basically living off of bread right now. =-\   Would love you forever if someone would hook me up with a big beefy cheesy pizza for lunch tomorrow, or after I get off work or something... :-D   Thanks for reading.  :-)  Would send pics, address, or whatever you want. God bless.	True

My boyfriend and I just recently moved in to our new home together, but alas, we are finding what little money we DO have to be going towards other expenses such as rent, electricity, insurance, gas, etc, and we've had no means of going out for groceries.

t3_jf2fg	1313015614.0	beanieb	shroom	[Request] Just a run of good karma but bad luck. NC.	I'm just feeling really down right now, and a pizza would help loads. Long story short: I'm a graduate student making not so much a year. Last month, I picked up an abandoned dog in the middle of a parking lot. Wasn't financially prepared to get a dog, she just kind of wandered into my life. Ended up bringing her home, getting her spayed and up to date on shots. Turns out she's heartworm positive, but the love of my life right now. Between vet bills and paying my pet deposit ($400...ugh), I realized today I have $404 in my account to last me until the end of the month, and bills haven't been paid yet. I was sitting there thinking about what I have in my pantry and what kind of meals I can make without grocery shopping for the rest of the month so I can still provide for my dog as well.   As I was coming home and turning into my neighborhood, a truck ran a stop sign and hit my car. I had to wait 45 minutes out in the sun waiting for the cops to get there/report to get written up. Come home, and to top everything off, my dog had peed on the carpet.  It's my birthday next week, but I'm stressed about finances, school, getting my dog up and healthy, and now on top of it, getting my damned car fixed.   I've bought pizza before, and never thought I'd be on the asking end, but I can't think of anything right now that would make me feel just a little bit better. I will definitely be re-paying it back in the future. Just for now I'm in a bit of a bind.   Willing to offer you any proof...I just need a reason to smile right now.   EDIT: Got a pizza from thenewblueblood. Thank you!! http://imgur.com/DYEkJ	True

t3_jefi6	1312968167.0	RogueDarkJedi	soawesome	Thank you RAOP for making my day better	So last night/early this morning, Rollout ended up [posting this request](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jdfyl/request_the_kind_redditor_that_helped_us_out/) to buy me some pizza.  Two amazing redditors responded to the call:  1. **ReillyBoy** went and bought two pizzas, plus cheesy bread and lava cakes (I absolutely love lava cakes). They exceeded above and beyond the call. I truly wasn't expecting so much food and I express how much I am grateful that ReillyBoy stepped in and provided food.  2. **jimwll**, who sent me a Papa John's gift card that will be put to good use and will keep me fed for the next week (or more).  I also want to thank all the mods, the people who upvoted my post and those that send me kind words of encouragement.  You have no idea how much you have made my day better.   So stay classy, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza and thank you for making a poor college student have hope!  *tl;dr*: Rollout asked me to help RAOP move to a flair system so that they could use the [Easy Flair tool](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/jc7q9/i_made_a_tool_that_makes_it_easier_to_give_users/) I wrote for Reddit moderators. He then posted about my situation and several awesome redditors responded.   **Result**: An extremely humbled and grateful person who loves you all for being so awesome!  Many, many thanks!  -RDJ	True
t3_je2t5	1312937267.0	analogy_4_anything	pizza	[Request] This is a bit ironic.	I won some of those cards from Dominos earlier and thought "Yay! Food for the week!". I even gave 1 away earlier as I feel it's good to spread the wealth. Unfortunately, the only Domino's by me is run by a jerk.   He's stopped taking online orders and refuses to take my giftcards over the phone. He's a jerk in general and friends and I have had issues with him before. He closes his store at 8:30 too, even though the stores hours are posted as open until 11p.m. According to my friend, who tried to work for him once, he hates running that store and doesn't give a sh*t.  I've sent an email to corporate but they won't be able to do anything until tomorrow at the earliest. Don't suppose anyone could buy me some Pizza Hut or something? I'd be ETERNALLY grateful. =)  **EDIT:** I have been helped by Reillyboy! [Thanks again!](http://i.imgur.com/05mNe.jpg)	True

PLUS I get a kid's drawing. Pizza away!	True

I haven't done this yet, but I guess the person who has the most interesting reason for needing a pizza will win it! And thanks again to this most wonderful subreddit for helping me eat this week!

t3_jcjzb	1312822824.0	bgoldman86	pizza	[Offer] Vegan pizza	I will order a pizza for someone hungry that's willing to eat it vegan-style. I'm vegan, and I order vegan pizza from non-vegan restaurants reasonably often. Usually, I get spinach on the bottom instead of cheese, and I get extra tomato sauce, and pile on veggies. It's really good with jalapenos/pineapples, or onions and double olives, or green peppers/onions/garlic or whatever you want.  Post a comment here with why you want a pizza, and I will pick someone to order vegan pizza for (maybe even two people) within 5-10 hours so you can eat it for dinner tonight. The pizzas should be able to be ordered online so I can order it for you. Or, if you want to order someplace local, you can email me a scanned receipt and I can PayPal you.  In your comment, write what toppings you want, or you can write "surprise me" and I'll decide for you if you're selected.  UPDATE: Kellie (kiwi061216) won the first pizza and I'm buying her and her two kids two pizzas momentarily. However, I'm feeling generous today and will be (and have been) making other pizza-giving offers in this thread. Just watch out for my replies. I will post the other "winners" up here as well.  UPDATE 2: Kellie's pizzas have been ordered (http://express.dominos.com/pages/tracker.jsp?OrderKey=157037670753&StoreID=1570), and I'm about to order a pizza for zorgath and his fiancee. I've also made some other pizza offers to other people too, because this has been fun.  UPDATE 3: Kellie and her kids have eaten their pizza and I have ordered zorgath's pizza. Other pizza offers are pending.  UPDATE 4: zorgath and his fiancee enjoyed their pizza and will be posting a pizza pic. Kellie should also be posting a pizza pic at some point. I am also about to order a pizza for iwillpayyouback, and there should be another couple pizzas coming up tomorrow or in the near future.

t3_jc3cx	1312777227.0	Jescartes	pizza	[Offer] Giving two pizzas (to two different redditors) in 5-6 hours	I've come into some money recently, and (knowing that soon, I'm going to be poor again and eager for a random pizza to come my way) I'd like to give away a couple of pizzas.

I'll check back this evening :)	True
t3_jc21j	1312774243.0	Gothbot6k	shroom	Random acts of pizza I would like to explain my last 12 months in hopes of getting a pizza.	Ok RaP.  Let me tell you about myself: Im Male and Im 18 (as of a week ago.) I live with my mom and a roommate My mom is divorced twice. Im basically a 3rd parent to my baby brother. My mom won't let me grow up.  I am an ent and thats how I make it through every day/week/month (I just started this year.) I have diagnosed seasonal depression.insomnia and anxiety. Which I should be seen for but lack of money prevents that. Im a gamer. I havent talked to my father /step mother in 2 years because they made me suicidal and stole $500 from me (save up allowance money over the years)      Heres the last 12-14 months of my life. (this is more of a rant) My stepdad left my mom who makes less then a school teacher and is a  mother of two. My mom wasn't able to file for child support for 4 months after this. So we had to survive on our own since my stepdad did everything he could do not to pay child support. And he didn't for 4 months. Last summer I was allowed to get my first job (my mother is controlling and doesn't want me to grow up) And at the beginning of it my mom told I could keep every penny for me. However all the money went to food/bills. My bonds I had had since I was born were ready to be cashed so they were. $800 and never saw a penny.  I also had to quit wow :(   My mom gets a really nice laptop from work (maxed out macbook pro) that was meant for work but it was her replacement instead of raise. My stepfather takes care of all the Macs in the city that we live and he had to make sure that it got taken away from her. And he did. Now she uses my computer and I don't really get to use my computer till now.  I had to quit my job :(  My mother is constantly under stress and has a heart condition so during my time of major depression Im also under constant stress and have panic attacks everyday. I also develop insomnia and get about 2-3 hours of sleep every night during the begging-middle of a school year.  At about december my step father stole my mothers identity and charged over $300 to a gay porn site. He did this twice the second time way in may for the same reason. He also ran up $40000 worth of credit card bills while married and will finally be payed off after 8 of waiting next year. He also isn't taking responsibility of that.  My grandmother fell and got pneumonia. She also had polio as a child and only has one lung. She now lives permanently in an ICU and can never walk/e/talk again because of a traych. ( I can't spell) This wouldn't bother me so bad except my mother keeps bring up that she will never be able to say I love you again. She's also basically a vegetable and doesn't want to be like this but my grandfather is in denial and won't let go. He is also having panic/heart attacks so he won't visit because they cause him and my mother is torn up over this and thinks as soon as her mother goes her father will go. And because of the empathy its killing me as well.  About a few months ago my stepdad started to brain wash my baby brother so that he wouldn't want to visit my mom anymore and he could stop paying child support.  Now we come to this point. Most of this is still going on however with my stepdad gone we had to get a roommate. (an high school sweet heart of my mom) and he's paying for some things. But over the past year Ive had to be the man of the house since my stepdad was gone. My mom was so depressed for the first 3 months that I had to be the parent to my little brother. So now I watch him and IM a 3rd parent at the age of 18 now. Because of my stepdad he freaks out whenever he's alone by himself so he is really clingy and has issues with leaving (because of his dad walking out (my stepdad)) So alongside of being the parental figure in his life I have to manage the house and other things. And you know what it just sucks.  Recently (1 month ago)  my step father got me a used macbook from a family friend. Well since my moms was taken away because of him and was using my computer (desktop) she immediately decreed it to be hers. And that really pisses me off because for the last 8 years of my life Ive been asking for a laptop. And I finally get a good one (close to as good as my desktop) and she takes it from me. In the past 2 days she has used it more then Ive held it.  And it really sucks because I was going to use it for college next year but I guess Ill have to find $1000 to get another that is if I can even get money for college. And what really brings me to a fury is that this is her 6th laptop in 4 years… All of which were given to her.   So today specifically:I was woken up 5 hours before I wake up (Ive been getting up at 3 pm lately) I was told to go do ALL THE YARD WORK. So I did over the course of 6 hours. I hate yard work more then anything.But I put up with it. I come inside after a long day of work… She had been using the laptop to get on Facebook while she watched movies with my brother ON MY BED IN MY ROOM USING MY THINGS DIDNT ASK OR ANYTHING. She then proceeds to throw a bitch fit because I ask if I can use the laptop for 10 mins and she could use the desktop not 3 feet away from her. This put me over the edge I kicked everyone out (mom took the laptop) and Ive been trying to cool down ever since. Not 15 minutes later she threw my brother on my for 4 hours of baby sitting. Now I love my brother and mother but I honestly get sick and tired of everything. I used to be a person I used to have a life and do things. I was a teenager living the life!But now I don't get to have a life till my brother goes to bed at 9:30. And at that point its 30 mins till I crash. I try to be a good person. I recycle, Im vegetarian.  I generally do good things but honestly life sucks. Especially when it hits you head on. Now to talk about food. For the past year Ive been having to eat food that is walmart brand and kroger brand which is all fine and good but I would love some pizza. I haven't had a slice of pizza in over a year. Ive had to skip out of eating lunch because we can't afford it. And we can't afford a pizza often so we haven't done it since my stepdad was here. Tommorow August 8th 2011. It would be really awesome if at 5 pm someone could have a papa johns pizza delivered. Specifics: Large Cheese Pizza (I will make this last at least 4 meals) Cheese sticks 2 liter (this will last me a week) A cinnapie would be cool but not needed.  Tl:DR Shitty year could really use a slice of better life.  PM me if your serious and want to know info.   *edit* I received money for the pizza. The user would like to remain anonymous but thank you very much. Your an incredible human being. I thank you for making my life easy in a difficult time. :)	True

t3_jbmnh	1312736046.0	hypodermia	PIF	[Request] -- (Vancouver, WA [PDX area]) -- I'll Paypal someone money if they buy me a pizza. See text for details.	I have a Paypal card on the way so's I can get access to my Paypal funds, and in the meantime, I can't figure out how to confirm my credit union bank account. So I have tons of money in Paypal I can't get out.  In the meantime, my first paycheck from my new job isn't for a couple of weeks, and I'm having a little trouble coasting by, food-wise.  So I'm offering to send someone some money via Paypal (I guess a leap of faith on my part), and when you get the receipt, just send me some pizza in return. You might even profit a little, if you want.  Simple?  (If you can suggest a way for me to make this seem less like a scam, let me know. I know it sounds a bit scammy. I'll do whatever verification of myself I can.)  EDIT: DONE! Thanks, Elumako!	True

I was laid off a little over a month ago (on my birthday, no less), and while I recently started a new job that pays better, I don't get my first paycheck until next week. I know it would mean a lot to him if someone could feed him, and it would mean a lot to me if we could get something to soak up the alcohol from the last 24 hours before he does anything stupid.  Once I get my finances back in order, I will be back to pay it forward.	True

I'll let the winner come forward if they choose.  BTW, I'm a sneaky bastard as I hope you will soon find out.  Love and full stomachs to all! Tres**   ~~~~   ~~(Mods, if this is in violation of the rules please delete and let me know what part was in violation so that I can try again :)  )  I have a fantastic life and am very happy.  Happiness was increased today when I was told I am getting a little bonus for doing such a good job at work.  I want to share with RAoP and make someone's day!  I also want to spread joy and happiness through out a beautiful subreddit that has had a recent rough patch.  I will come back here between no later than 9pm eastern and select the winner of the delicious pie.  If you won't be home during those hours, don't worry!  If you win we can chat and determine a time that works best for you.  Rules (my money, my rules, right?).  1) You must use the verification system.   2) I will send myself an eCard and send the pizza with that.  3) Will only send to residential addresses.  4) I will be the sole judge of this contest.  I am in WV (USA) but will not show regional preference.  I'm not positive that the ecards work between countries.   To win:  Entertain me and the rest of the subreddit.  Write a song or song parody, write a story, post a picture, tell a joke, make a youtube, do whatever you want and whatever makes you happy.    To help you judge what might entertain me:  I'm a 45 yo lesbian, love dogs, love cats, love fart jokes, think rage comics can be hysterical, adore just about anything "inappropriate for polite company (except for violent/gross pictures)."  I also like things that make you go "awww."  I was going to require that the winner agree to post a picture of the pizza, but I don't want to rule out folks who don't have cameras.  A picture of the pizza would be awesome, though.  If you use a computer at a library, please don't hesitate to enter.  You don't have to receive the pizza tomorrow (later today), you just have to enter by then.  If you can only check in once every few days and you are the winner, you will have an inbox message from me the next time you stop by.  Love, cheese, and sauce to all!~~~~~~	True

The one that amuses me the most will win. I'll check at 10 a.m. EST Friday. Good luck!~~  Wow. A lot of really entertaining entries.

t3_j9dpm	1312505183.0	capitalb620	FAP	[REQUEST]Didn't want to post a request, but got scammed with a few others earlier.	For a minute I was okay with not getting a pizza (See:http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j9d39/so_we_really_have_to_watch_out_for_people_seeming/), but a combination of having my hopes raised and my belief that someone here would like to restore my faith in this sub led me to posting a request. I had been debating it throughout the day, then stumbled upon the above "offer", but you can see how that turned out. By all means, if you don't want to gift me a pizza, maybe take a look at one of the few others in the original thread that was left hanging by an immature ass. Thanks.  EDIT: All hooked up thanks to SarTim! Thank you!	True

Why yes, my eyes do see.    I didn't want this to be a sad story,    But one more of rhyming glory,    So these rhymes I do write,    to bring my request into the light,    Words are my passion,    and these rhymes I do fashion,    Because i'm asking, on my knees,    Could I have some pizza, please?

I'm an artist of the Not Usually Starving variety, but am not getting paid until next week, so I thought maybe someone would like a picture in exchange for pizza.  I will draw and watercolor you a cartoon of any animal you want eating pizza, and mail it to you.  It would help boost my morale as I tackle a weekend of long hours spent drawing cats.  I know, my life is so hard. eta - it occurs to me that I need to establish my animal-eating-pizza credentials, so here's something I drew a while ago - http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/812/ratpizza.jpg/ and, I'm in WA.  eta2 - leaving this up, but I retract my request, because now I gotta get to work for my project deadline and wouldn't have time to do a cartoon until after I get paid anyway (and then I will be getting myself some pizza XD)  I don't think anyone's going to read this far back into the requests, but I want to make sure pizza goes to other folks, just in case!

Thanks again, Digiteknique!!!!!	True
t3_j8c5e	1312421106.0	DEStudent	PIF	THANK YOU FOR IFTAR!	I just wanted to thank PakistaniMuslim for his or her kindness and generosity in donating Iftar to Fasting Muslims. It really means a lot after fasting 12+ hours  to have a nice meal  THANK YOU AND I like your idea: Random_Iftars!  Also as a side note: Iftar (Arabic: إفطار‎), refers to the evening meal when Muslims break their fast during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Iftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their fast together. Iftar is done right after Maghrib (sunset) time. Traditionally, a date is the first thing to be consumed when the fast is broken.   Ramadan (Turkish:Ramazan) (Arabic: رمضان‎ Ramaḍān, Arabic pronunciation: [rɑmɑˈdˤɑːn]) is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, which lasts 29 or 30 days. It is the Islamic month of fasting, in which participating Muslims refrain from eating, drinking and intimacy with their partners[1] during daylight hours and is intended to teach Muslims about patience, spirituality, humility and submissiveness to God. Muslims fast for the sake of God (Arabic: الله‎, trans: Allah) and to offer more prayer than usual. Compared to the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan vary, moving backwards by about eleven days each year depending on the moon; thus, a person will have fasted every day of the calendar year in 34 years' time. Muslims believe Ramadan to be an auspicious month for the revelations of God to humankind, being the month in which the first verses of the Qur'an were revealed to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.  While I know there are some on this site that may be agnostic, Christian, Jewish, Atheist or any other belief, I can honestly say this was a pleasant surprise. This was not about excluding anyone from getting pizza, this was something our brother or sister did as charity and a kindness.   If you have any further questions about Islam, or Muslims or what we believe, please feel free to ask. (NO TROLLS OR YOU WILL BE REPORTED)	True

Last night I received [this!](http://i.imgur.com/Oknc7.jpg) a wonderful thick crust cheddar only pizza from dominos with Italian sausage, jalapeno peppers, diced tomatos, onions, and mushrooms.  (seen here taking two homebrew to the ball)  It was a surprise for [this girl](http://i.imgur.com/7QtUK.jpg) seen here lunging gluttonously for the pizza.  She was ecstatic and so grateful! (she is lactose intolerant which is why I asked for an all chedder pizza, Chadnickbok obliged!)  Over the next 20 minutes we did [this alot](http://i.imgur.com/KfAfO.jpg)  And suddenly it looked alot more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/bNWuj.jpg).  I was so full, satisfied, and happy that I fell asleep less than 15 minutes after eating, while watching shark week.  Hence why I didn't post this all last night.  I am so grateful to Chadnickbok for this selfless act, and to RAOP for inspiring this generosity in people.  I look forward to being able to pay it back.  PS.  I made sure to tip the very courteous delivery man generously.  This should be a tradition in RAOP if it isn't already.	True

I will do the ordering because I tried purchasing 5 gift cards on Cashstar and it kept declining my card with an error that said I must contact them. I don't feel like talking to customer service reps all afternoon so if I choose you jut PM me your address and I'll order. If you know for a fact that your local pizza place asks for the credit card used during checkout, don't bother.  Rules to receive pizza:  Only 1. Your account must be older than a week. If its a new account, I can't help you. Also, I will require a verification code.   Edit: It looks like theres another rule.

Edit: I should probably close this, as it is heading towards 100 posts. So it is closed. I will be sending more pizzas to people who already posted. No mas!!

I couldn't believe it.  I haven't entirely looked through other requests as I'm pretty sure I'm not the only hungry person in the world, but tbh after I read the sidebar I immediately grabbed my camera and made a "REQUEST" because I'm hungry.  The embarrassing part is asking for food on the internet- forget that.  [1] Food going bad, fridge practically empty   [2] Ice-cream I bought gone bad, this is after I knew my refrigerator started trolling   [3] I'm not starving I have lots of bread, but as you can see I can't stand it, at least for today.    I give my praise to anyone that fulfills my request.    When I get the money I'm seriously giving back a redditor a free pizza.    Located in GA  **update:** being able to get free pizza from a fellow redditor I don't even know is unreal   I feel terribly bad, I just found out about this sub-reddit and within 3 hours a redditor gives me a pizza   I feel as if I'm cutting in line, however I'm grateful and I thank you.    Don't forget someone will get a pizza from me.  **update 2:** I've done myself a good [deed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jcpic/offer_10_dominos_gift_card_me_giving_back/), but I can tell you this isn't the end. 	1403818619.0

(Texas)	I'm broke for another two weeks and so dang hungry for some good eats. I paid my rent today, and got my phone turned back on, and now I've got nada to last me until my next check. Not to mention, I owe some money to the bank due to some ridiculous overdraft fees that I did not intentionally incur. My rent check was cashed by my landlord really late, after I thought he'd already taken it out a while back. I had to ask my roommate to cover the utility bills until I can pay my half later (I'll be sharing the possible pizza with her too, she's an angel).   I'm steadily working on a film my friends and I are making, which I love, but buying supplies for what I want/need to do along with paying my bills has left me in a bit of a rut. Frankly, I fucked up on my budget. I have an interview for a second job tomorrow, which I'm pretty stoked about.   Other than that, I love pizza, so naturally Random_Acts_Of_Pizza is freaking awesome. If someone meets my request, I'll pay you back or someone else once I get back on my feet in a few weeks, no problem.  	True

t3_j51d1	1312142868.0	luckytopher	pizza	[request] Doing sell-the-house prep work, wife is away...	Recent circumstances demand us to sell the house we're in.  I'm spending this weekend doing all the little tedious and painful things that need to be done to make a house presentable on the market (paint, fixing those 95% finished projects, etc) for a quick sale...  The wife is away for the weekend with her family, so it's just me... I am sure I *could* pick up my own pizza, but we're really scrimping to be able to cover all the seller/closing costs for the house so just trying to watch the pennies...  A small or medium pizza would be great, just something to munch on all day (and night) while working on these projects.    Edit: when the house is sold and this transition is complete, i will most definitely pay it forward!	True
t3_j4ym0	1312136012.0	katlol	PIF	[REQUEST] For My Baby's Birthday~	It's my girl's birthday! She's 23 now, getting close to her expiration date. We were supposed to go out drinking, but all of our of-age friends have to work or have their babies and can't go out with us, so we cancelled it. She's at work now, and she doesn't know that I invited our BFF Lillith over to play Kinect ALL. FUCKING. NIGHT. (Her mom got her Kinect Sports for her birthday :D)   My sister, who has to work at 6AM, donated three packs of beer, and by beer I mean Mike's Hard Lemonade, because we're hard like that.   All I have left in my fridge until tomorrow is condiments, cheese, bacon, eggs, and mushrooms. Hoping we can eat pizza instead of omelettes tonight for our way-cooler-than-going-out-all-girls-party. Thanks for your consideration =D   **EDIT**: Not my best picture, but couldn't find a working camera so I used a cell phone. >_<   http://i52.tinypic.com/2dmcmx1.jpg   My girlfriends reaction to Happy Birthday from the internet?

t3_j4tcv	1312119214.0	mishagale	FAP	[REQUEST] Hungry and broke in London	I seem to have burned through my student loan for this year, and no more to be expected until September. Wouldn't have been such a problem had I not foolishly lost my job a while ago. Right now I've no food to speak of in the house, and an essentially empty bank account. I've liquidated some [bitcoins](/r/bitcoin), but it being the weekend funds won't be in my account for another few days.  Saw an ad for this subreddit and frankly it made me hungry for pepperoni. Whether or not anyone responds to this request, I intend to buy someone a pizza next week when I'm hopefully marginally less skint.  P.S. Just saw [Dominos](http://www.dominos.co.uk) are doing "Any Pizza, Any Size" for £9.99 until Tuesday!	True

t3_j4khu	1312081709.0	Nightsfaded	shroom	[Request] 	Hi there, well I am kinda hesitant about asking but I think the stomach is winning the war over pride. Long story short, had a roommate bail on me, owes me a bunch of monies. Financial aid for summer didn't go so far when my expenses for roof/power/water almost doubled. Hey but it's been great for aesthetics I've lost about 15 pounds since May. Its also been great for teaching me how to be more frugal, and learned to accept charity ( thank you whatever is above for food pantrys). I am moving soon, back home for the fall but I am down to $60 which has to last two weeks, and half of which will have to go to gas. I am in Las Cruces, NM. . . Have a code and such and a major hankering for some hot delicious pizza. Extra Karma bonus Points if you get them to draw a Pony on the box, preferably Pinkie Pie. . .	True

User [Paulinator](http://www.reddit.com/user/paulinator) most graciously responded to my post. He/She sent me some awesome pizza money, and I bought my mom a pizza and she was able to relax after a hard day of work and enjoy the generosity of others (when she is so generous herself). If she knew how to work reddit, she'd be saying thanks as well haha. I guess [this picture right here](http://i.imgur.com/eX4jd.jpg) will do.  But I had some more money left over, and to be honest, I thought about buying myself a pizza. But I thought against that, because I was sure there were better ways to spend that money. So I bought a pizza for my friends who go to school like 8 hours a day, I figured a sweet pizza would be a good idea.  Here's their thanks in the [awesome](http://i.imgur.com/yXZNp.jpg) form of [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/Q0FBM.jpg). I know that trolls and people who take advantage of this subreddit have been a serious issue and topic of conversation here, so take comfort in the fact that this subreddit helped make the day of several people. Not to mention they **totally** didn't see it coming, so the RANDOM part of random acts of pizza was completely upheld. Cheers, guys, thanks for helping out. And thanks again to Paulinator!	True

Anyway, my mother, who's one of the hardest working people I know, has done nothing but drive for the past two days. She's driven from Northern Indiana to Alabama and back to pick up my sisters, and she really does not feel like cooking. I don't blame her. We have food possibilities, and as such, I totally understand if we don't get anything, but it'd be really nice if we could get a pizza, because we aren't exactly financially blessed. The drive there was pretty taxing physically, emotionally, and monetarily. So, um pretty please?	True
t3_j3pt2	1311984024.0	SmokeSerpent	pizza	(sort of) [OFFER] Central Valley, California	I am the district manager for a pizza franchisee in these parts, and I've been loading this subreddit daily for a while waiting for someone in my neck of the woods to post a request. I've got nothing against those who can just up and buy an e-gift for anyone anywhere, but I have a very specific ability which is to gift pizzas to people who happen to live in one of three cities in Central California, so it makes me sad that most request don't include even the vaguest of locations.

You get one point for every $5 you spend and 25 points = a large 3 topping pizza.  To sign up you just go to your account and enroll.

t3_j1rn9	1311819556.0	dalidala	FAP	[request] I'll try this again, I guess. College student very low on food for the next few days	Yes, I am indeed new to Reddit (thanks to my boyfriend, I have seen the light). Minecrafter, Civil Eng. major, lover of electro swing, for some background. I don't particularly like asking for pizza here when I see so many others in need, but I'm in a bit of a desperate situation myself right now. I'll try not to make this too long or pathetic, but here goes. My lease doesn't start until August 1st and I've been living as a nomad since July 11th taking summer classes, not really having a solid place to stay (my previous plans before coming for class fell through). I've been able to stretch my dollar for weeks now, but my funds are running low. Honestly, I could probably make it to the 31st on what I have left, but I haven't had hot food in days. A pizza would just be...nice.  TL; DR: I'm a nomadic summer student hoping for some hot food after days of granola bars and ramen.  I'd also be more than willing to return the favor after I can get settled for fall semester. Thanks in advance; I really appreciate what you guys do here.  Tried this earlier, received absolutely no feedback. I don't expect anything, but I figured I could delete the old post and try again.  EDIT: Thank you ReillyBoy! I shall enjoy some hot pizza after studying for chem :D	True

t3_j1dmc	1311791424.0	drucey	pizza	[OFFER] A pizza for someone truly in need	Hi all,   I'm not a rich man - far from it, for come September I'll be throwing away a job and a house to pursue a career in medicine.  But, I was just given a small cash reward for something that didn't deserve a reward, nor would they listen to me refusing it. So I'll pay it forward.  If you're *genuinely* hungry this evening, and you want a pizza, I'd love to buy you one. Please don't take advantage of getting to this post the fastest - honestly consider whether you really need one.  I'm UK based - but if I can get one via an international website (i.e. US), then I'll do that instead.  Edit: I've had a few messages, but they're nearly all from brand new accounts. Is this the norm round here? I've only got one pizza to give away, and scared I'm getting done. Am I wrongly cynical?  Edit2: I've ordered a disposable VISA card. It looks to be the only way I can order internationally, and I can help several people instead of one here in the UK. I'll repost as soon as it arrives. If anyone, in the meantime, can find a way I can order food (not just pizza!) to someone in the USA with paypal or similar, please send me a message   Edit3: Might have managed to get a Domino's e-card thing, waiting for confirmation  Edit4: Success - I have a Domino's eGift Card. I'm probably going to hell for this, but unfortunately cannot consider anyone with a brand new (zero day) account  Edit5: This has now been given to someone in need. I'll do what I can to help again next week, apologies it's not more often.	True

Unfortunately, the only help I got was lots of people being rude and uncaring. I spent all of our money to get her home on Saturday and things are going ok for our family, but we are flat broke until Thursday. redd.it/iurkz was the link to my request last week. We could really use something to tide us over. I can pay it forward on Thursday.  Verification code nghddNZZBn11 Location: Palm Coast Florida 32164 	True
t3_j0ert	1311707027.0	climb0r	shroom	[Request] Broken elbow, broke, and armed with sugar, frozen chicken, and baking soda until Friday.	As a rock climber and guitarist, I've been bummed out since I screwed up my elbow ten days ago. I'm behind on rent, bills, and loans already, forgot about automatic bill pay this Monday, and I am overdrafted until my low-pay check on Friday. [Can't get this melancholy but beautiful song out of my head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ5isLBu_To).  Chicken is nice, and these are definitely First World (Boston) college student troubles. My light at the end of the tunnel is a comp sci Bachelor's (and job?) in December, but, man, pizza sounds like pure love right now.   Edit: The unassuming delivery guy handed me an unexpected cold soda and set of garlic bread, along with a huge pizza laden with sausage, prosciutto, and peppers. I couldn't stop grinning. A thousand thanks to anthonybsd!	True

The old family jalopy broke down recently and in order to make it back & forth we had to take on a car payment.

t3_iz8dq	1311607131.0	deadparrotx	shroom	[Request] Pizza for me and my boy	I don't normally ask for things from people, especially ones I don't know, but this subreddit seems pretty awesome..  My backstory: I'm a 24 year old single dad with full custody of my 5 year old. Things have been really tight for years..pretty much since I graduated high school. I pay for everything on my own and between rent, car payment, utilities, groceries, and a $440 daycare bill every month there isn't much left. His mother chips in $75/month which doesn't even pay for a week of daycare.   Anyway, my son starts elementary school next week and is scared to death. Would love to surprise him with a pizza :]  Since I won't be having that massive daycare bill next month I will gladly pay it forward!	True

t3_iymko	1311543868.0	cp7825	shroom	[Request] I have a job interview tomorrow, but I haven't eaten in three days D:	My suit's pressed, I've spent the last two days researching and memorizing everything I can about the place, I even googled tips for acing an interview. I'm really pumped and I think I'm ready to nail this... the only problem is that I haven't eaten in three days, and I haven't had a good meal for longer than that. My arms are shaking, I can hardly walk without my heart beating furiously, and I just noticed that my voice shakes as well. If I show up to an interview like this I' afraid they'll think I'm a crackhead (I'm pretty skinny). The last substantial thing I ate was a sample of a sandwich from Jimmy Johns, (I asked for three and gave the other two to the homeless people I'd passed a block before) that was on Wednesday.  I just need some sustenance, whether it be a pizza, sammich... shoo I'd be excited about a bag of breadsticks.  If anyone is gracious enough to help me out, I promise to return the favor and help people out on RAOP as soon as financially possible.  Thanks for your time!	True
t3_iyeo1	1311521814.0	dianeruth	pizza	[swap?] DC area- I have a coupon code for papa johns(free large 1 topping, no catch) good on the 8th or later, but am out of their service area.	~~The coupon code is good only in the [DC area](http://www.thecapitoldeal.com/engine/SplashDetails.aspx?contestid=21722&productid=2786763) (NoVa, and nearby MD included), for a large 1 topping pizza, and includes tax and delivery fee.  I got it from a promotion the Wash Post did just a few days ago.  Well apparently I'm out of their service area, and I can't drive so I picking it up would be a royal pain(sitting on the bus for 20 min with a pizza....).  A large 1 topping Papa Johns is 14$.~~  ~~Like I said, you can't use it until after the 8th.~~  ~~No sob story, I'm a college student, but no more broke than any other.  I pretty much never eat restaraunt food, and was just really excited about my pizza and I pretty much would have no good way to get it now. :/ ~~ ~~Anybody willing to swap with me for Dominoes?~~  ~~Similarly if somebody wants to just donate, I would obviously pay it forward using this code later.~~   Edit:  All figured out, somebody has graciously donated to me, and I will be donating in a couple weeks.  Edit2:  They seem pretty content with their anonymity, but I just wanted to add that they gave me 30$ instead of the 15$ I requested, so YAY for random pizza! :D	True
t3_iy4tu	1311478516.0	GreenLightning2010	pizza	cashstar needs to fix their system!	So this was our first time offering and as much as I love helping, cashstar made it a nightmare. They are the people who actually run the e-gift card sites listed on the sidebar. No matter what I did, their site would decline my order because the street address did not match. Apparently this is not an uncommon thing, they even said to just use a different card (I don't have a different card). I spent way too long on the phone with them and my credit card (who thought all the excess attempts were fraud and closed my card temporarily). Reddit - how can we convince them to make their site work better so there aren't unnecessary delays in getting people their pizzas?  EDIT - I even got out my billing statement and wrote my street address exactly as it appears, per cashstar's suggestion, no dice.	True

t3_ixcyb	1311388327.0	kencater	pizza-gold	Probably not the right Reddit, but thought the readers here would be the best audience!	So, tonight I stopped at the gas station to get Red Bull and smokes. There was a lady there who got $50.00 in gas whose credit card was being denied. I could tell by her expression that she knew the card was busted, but she was desperate. After waiting in line behind her about ten minutes, she decided to try the in-store ATM. I made my transaction and left.  When leaving the parking lot I couldn't help but notice a van with a bunch of dogs inside. The sticker on the door identified it as belonging to the One At A Time Pet Rescue. The gas pump it was beside read $50.00. I put two and two together and turned around. The lady was still at the ATM and was talking to her husband on the phone trying to figure out what to do. So I bought the gas and a coffee for her. Or rather for the animals. She had 24 dogs in the van. I work in a disaster related field in a devastated area and it was apparent that she had picked up dogs from an overrun shelter and was taking them elsewhere to be adopted out. If any of you are looking for a new friend, give them a call. also find them at www.oneatatime.petfinder.org  [DOGGIES!](http://imgur.com/dOBj7.jpg)  TL;DR If you are looking for a worthy cause to give to, consider our animal friends.  Edit: For a while there, I thought it was a bad idea to post this here, but seeing the support, I am now glad I did. In the interest of continuing the positivity, let's give away some pizza. Look at the NEW posts for more info. Give me a few minutes to put it together.	True

San Diego, California	Edit: Don't let the number of comments fool you. My family and I are still requesting the food.   So, before I continue with this request, I have to say this. I posted here yesterday, and I was hoping someone would be kind enough to give me and my family some food to get through the night. Hey! A comment! Yes! I tell my mom we have food, and tells the neighbor to go ahead and eat without us, because we would have sustenance. The guy says he orders it. I trusted him. 40 mins later, I get worried. 10 mins pass, and I call the Pizza Hut the order would come from, and they said they haven't gotten one online order all night. Fuck. We are going to bed hungry. Again. I don't know if the trolls on here get kicks from knowing you embarrassed and hurt someone, but if you do, that's pretty messed up.    *now, the request*   My mom had surgery the day before yesterday. She had a reconstruction procedure to rebuild her nipple after losing her left breast to breast cancer. She can not cook the few foods we have in her current state. After being left by her husband (me and my sisters dad) we were barely clinging to all economic firmness by her job, working at my high school as a health technician for the Special Ed students. Recently there has been a lot of lay-offs in Southern California by the state. A lot of school district employees have been cut, and tragically, my mother was one of them. Months earlier, my sister was also laid off by her employer at a local business. The unemployment she receives is barely enough to cover the inflated rent of this one bedroom apartment of San Diego California. My family, would love some warm, real, good food tonight.	True

Big Thanks going out to all who have contributed. This is a powerfully positive thing even if there are those who would take advantage or take for granted others kindness. Kindness is still the best way - I think because it generally tends to multiply itself to a certain degree.    I've had a few pizzas on request and had one given to me in a truly random way, which was fun. I'm fondly looking forward to the day when I can pay it all forward in pepperoni.  **edit:** As a side note: I came *close* to getting a tattoo of a stinky slice of pepperoni pizza on my shoulder when I was 18.

t3_itxnh	1311092691.0	DEStudent	PIF	REQUEST- Couldn't make this one up if I tried...	Hello all: I'm writing to ask for pizza although I did receive one about 2 or 3weeks ago. If I get a pizza, great, but at this point I just need to get this off my chest. My husband has a son from a previous marriage and we got a call from his mother in another state that he was out of control and she was kicking him out. My husband offered to come pick up his son. So we scrambled around trying to get a rental car (ours does not have AC and it was over a 2hr drive) and spent money we didn't really have after paying late fees on the rent. So we used our last bit of money, but the "baby mama" said she would give the money back when we arrived. We called to let the boy's mother know we were on the way and come to find out, he ran away. We arrived and began looking for this boy. He is 16y/o and left home without an ID or money. We were there from 0930 until 6pm and never found him. My husband had to come home because he had to work in the morning. His mother heard from him that he's okay, but won't say where he is. All day yesterday, I sat by my phone awaiting a call. He lives in a major metropolitan city and we fear possible drug use. His father is heart broken and his the boy's mother never called us AT ALL YESTERDAY. Imagine not knowing if your son is alive or dead... My husband called this morning and she said he's okay, but just won't come home...  I know there are truly needy and hungry people on this forum. I was just hoping for a little pizza to try to take away some of the pain. We don't drink, smoke or do drugs. We have spaghetti noodles and potatoes which I don't mind. Some food is better than none, but we are really hurting. I know we always joke about the evil stepmother, but I do love and care for this boy. His problem is, he's out of control and doesn't want to live with Dad outside of NJ because there's not much going on here.  I guess that's it. I just need to write to heal my heart a little.  This is my verification code: Dj/r58ixiiNA  Time may heal all wounds, but a pizza would be nice also.  Thank you all for listening and caring. If you have your children safe and sound, hug them a little tighter.   *update: my stepson is here with us. He came after being escorted by police. He is very depressed. His mom told him this was just a week visit, only to see all of his things here. Working with him and will seek professional help. Still would love to treat him and husband to pizza tonight. Thank you*	True

I was doing good for a while, picked up a temp job, was motivated to loose some weight and I did, a good thirty pounds. However, the temp job was temporary..as they are are wont to be. I figured    "Ok, Mr. Facts. You've got a tiny bit of money saved up now. You'll be just great till you pick up a job! Keep your chin up you magnificent bastard!"  And it was rough for a while. You know the story. Packaged soups (Ramen), Peanut butter sandwiches, cool-aid (Poor mans champagne?) and a couple of times some delicious Hamburger Helper (Three Cheese all the way!). Well, lo and behold after all my resources are wasted and we shut off our net to save money,  we've been living off food boxes and charity...  I picked up a job! Excuse me while I do a mildly overweight happy jig.  "Unts, unts, unts! Jiggle Fat man!"  Now this job here, pays a whopping 9.00 an hr. That's four less than my last permanent one..but screw all that noise, it's money! Anyways, I won't start for three weeks from today, then it's an additional two weeks to my first paycheck.  Five weeks until I can go out and get my own damn Pizza!  Anyways! I'd like to surprise my wife, who has been so patient and understanding through this ordeal with more than a new kind of Ramen flavor and some Fun-Aid. I'd like to hook her saint like ass up with some cheese drowned, meat covered invention of the gods!  And, you would be helping a bloke out when he doesn't have much else to eat for the next five weeks.  Thanks Reddit! I love you man! "Sniff" I always get teary eyed at this part.  ...

I think overall the community is a wonderful place so far.  The news stories have brought a large influx of people, but I don't think the community has been adversely impacted besides the larger amount of traffic we've been seeing.  Most of the negativity has gone away and I'd like to keep it that way.  Some interesting notes that I've noticed:  * Weekends are the slowest days of the week Sundays are especially slow.   * Wednesdays are the highest traffic days.  Oh yeah, and new icon.  The other day in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ip2hr/request_in_a_money_knot_right_and_i_dont_get_my/) we were talking about a new icon for people that have previously given and now need  a pizza.  I call it forward a pizza.  You can see it in action at that link!  Also: read the sidebar if you haven't please.  Lastly, keep in mind, verification codes are one time use only.  **KEEP IT PRIVATE** and only send to the person requesting it to give you a pizza.  edit:  I was so hasty to give out the new icon I didn't realize Bottleman Pizza'd it Forward again.  I'll change his icon back to Pizza it Forward on Monday so you can still check out the new icon for the time being.	True

t3_ipti5	1310679040.0	RobotBuddha	shroom	[REQUEST] Three year redditor needs food, badly	I went over my current fiances, and I 'think' I can make next months rent. But involved in that process has been cutting down what I eat, and especially how much. I've been basically living on beans, rice, pickles, and potatoes. Now don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have anything. But I'm a little worried about what the lack of variation is going to do to my health. And I'll admit it, even more I just miss tasting a thing that has a flavor.   I've been posting on reddit for over three years now, for what that's worth. I think more important is the fact that one of the reasons I don't have money now is that I wound up donating a lot of it to the homeless when I did...and then I lost my job.   I do work now, but my total income is far below minimum wage. And I'm just scraping by. A pizza would mean more than most people would guess to me. I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/iite6/thanks_what_pizza_can_mean/) about a week back, about what someone's gift of a pizza to me a while back, before this subreddit existed, meant. That's where the meat of my sob story is.   tl;dr: Lack of food makes me rambly and I beg for pizza.   EDIT: The very awesome unmoderated is hooking me up!  Edit2: Pizza is currently sitting next to me! I'm about to eat the hell out of some slices before saving the rest, but I had to add one more time how awesome this is, and unmoderated for doing it.

So, here it goes.  My girlfriend, **MuchToTheDutch**, and I both recently got jobs after three months of being unemployed new arrivals to Austin. This is awesome,but we started our jobs the 27th of June and we got paid through the 30th. This basically meant that we had just barely enough to cover our rent and bills. We've been living off rice, beans, ramen, and pasta for the last 10 or 11 days and we have to stretch it until next Monday when we get paid.  We haven't even been eating lunch; it's down to a meal a day at this point.  If some awesome person could hook us up with a pizza tonight, it would completely make our day. We'll pay it back two fold come Monday and post a follow up thread that day too.  Thanks,  **TexanInExile**  **Edit: [This is the guy I was talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNZocat6NJE)**	True

t3_io2x4	1310527499.0	BossNobody	shroom	Thanks redditors and hlmre for your help.	So the other day I requested my first pizza. I was pretty hesitant on telling people my story. But I glad I did, I've been under stress for these past few months with all that has been going on. The post I made has allowed me to get things off my chest and the pizza brought some joy.  When we first got the pizza there was a bit of a mix up, but apparently it sorted itself out. I felt bad afterwards though cause it felt like I was falsely accusing you doing something wrong hlmre. The guy was asking for money and no one home had it at the time. I didn't really make it apparent to my family that I was asking for pizza from some one I didn't know. I didn't want them to really feel bad about our situation, so I told them a friend sent it and when they were with me at the door, I acted like it was fine when I gave them my credit info. I had 35 dollars to get me through the month it would have been a bit hit, sorry I over reacted.   I would hate to ask for pizza again, so I'm trying my best to make it stretch. Hopefully those pizzas can go to people who need it more. But if I do, I hope I can come back here again.  When I get a new job, had to quit my old one cause I wanted to spend more time with my dad when it seemed like he was going to die, I hope I can return the favour to another redditor.	True
t3_inr2g	1310502433.0	workroom	pizza	FYI: Domino's is way easier to order a eCard from than Pizza Hut	sorry, "an" eCard...  Pizza hut sends you an email with a phone number to call to verify your identity... then after sitting on   hold you're asked the referral order #, then sit on hold as they "pull that info up"... then get asked the  bank who issued your credit card, then 800 customer service number on that card, then the nearest cross street where you live!?  **edit:** annnnnnd now after all of that I just got an email saying the order could not be processed (after I went through all of that with the person on the phone and ending with her saying "ok I'll go ahead and put that through")  **edit #2: annnd now Domino's didn't go through...** seriously, **fuck cashStar**. they apparently called the wrong phone number when trying to varify the identity (*after I had just gotten off the phone with the customer service rep!!*) and they got some woman, who of course said she knew nothing about any pizza or credit card charge, so now I can't use my card at all with cashStar.

t3_innqo	1310496505.0	stevekresena	shroom	[Request] 2 hungry brothers	Two brothers here, just north of Austin TX. Stuck at home all day everyday without car/bike. We have no money to spend as we cant get jobs without reliable transportation. Im not whining, thats just the way it is. We would very much like to have something hot to eat today for lunch instead of cereal or peanut butter and jellies. My folks dont exactly have a lot of money floating around this time of the month so groceries are slim. Not life or death over here, but a break from the monotony and room temperature(or cold) meals would be something to really lift a couple redditors day/week/month :-)  EDIT: pizza received! Redditor wishes to remain anonymous so all you shall know about him/her is how awesome they are and how they fed two hungry people today. 	True
t3_inkwj	1310491383.0	doublev85	shroom	[REQUEST]Single dad of 2 looking for a little help. (MO)	First off, yes this is a new account. I've lurked around various subreddits for some time but I've never felt like I had anything to add. More of a reader than a talker I suppose. Anyways, my children's mother surprised me by dropping the kids off this morning, as she felt going to the lake with a new bf was important enough to warrant me taking a day off of work with no notice. I was supposed to have them this weekend, so I wasn't really prepared grocery wise. (None of this is her concern, but that whole thing is a story for a different subreddit.) If someone would like to make a couple of kids day a little better by giving them something besides ramen and toast, that would be great. I'm not creating this account just for this..I've been meaning to for a while and plan on posting a lot more, as well as paying this forward. Thanks for reading.  UPDATE: Thank you newchel. You're an awesome person.	True
t3_ini8z	1310486463.0	raevpet	pizza	[Offer] Pizza going out	At the beginning of this month I signed up for No Fap July. Today I failed.

t3_im22e	1310351612.0	BossNobody	shroom	[Request]Family has been going through some tough times. South Cal.	Someone has sent me a pizza. Thanks for reading. Hopefully I'll beable to return the favour sometime in the near future.  -------------------------  I live in one of the nicer parts of southern California. Most people here are somewhat well off middle class and my family was too. I come from a family of six and I'm the youngest. The family owns the house.  Heres the story, around sometime through last year, I don't know the exact time my parents were keeping it from the family so we wouldn't worry, my dad was diagnosed with liver cancer and he underwent chemo which restored his liver to pretty good functional state, but I think but don't know for a fact that the doctors said he would eventually have to get it replaced. Around October we get called in because they've found a potential match, but it turns out to be a fatty liver or something and was not suitable for transplant. Around November or December we got called in again. This time it was  a match!   Good news you would think. Unfortunately the events that followed has been pretty bad. During the operation there were complications with his heart and kidneys. He has had lots of bed rest and has lost quite a bit of weight and muscle mass. He is a pretty old guy to start with, give it a couple years and he could have retired. He now has to take dialysis a couple times a week, he can't work, and is pretty weak. Recently actually he got a blood infection were bacteria clumped up on one of his heart valves and he had to get that replaced. It's been nice seeing him try to recover and get better but when he is home it is quite depressing having to give him IV drips and watching him in such a state.  Though the family supports him my father's mindset has gone pretty down hill. Multiple times during his various surgeries we were unsure he was going to make it. At some point he might have actually died if my mom hadn't noticed something wrong with him that the doctor's missed during their check ups, this lowered his faith in the doctor's taking care of him. He is going to be modifying his will and giving us(his sons) the ownership of the house. So far the main source of income for the house has been cut off my brothers and I have been pooling our money monthly to pay for all the bills. Insurance has been covering most if of the medical fees, but we still have to pay a certain amount of course. It also runs out later this year and then we're pretty much out of luck.  I mainly am requesting the pizza because my brothers, who have been contributing more to the bills than me, deserve a treat and if I had the money I would buy it for them myself. I've been dipping into my car and school fund to help out. Buying food has been pretty rough on us. Costco runs are still pretty pricey. My brothers are footing most of the bills and hoping I can finish college in the next couple of years and help take over. We've been getting through the week eating rice with what ever we can afford that week and/or cheap instant products.  TL;DR Dad went to hospital, no longer working. Family pooling to keep house and pay medical bills.	True

[Context] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ilubb/our_verification_system_is_up_and_running_more/)  Let's test out this new system. Message me or reply to this post and I'll try to give out as many pizzas/giftcards as I can. Make sure to include pertinent information such as location, name, pizza chain (try to give me the actual address and toppings (vegetarian?)   edit: It would really help me out if you could call the pizza place of choice and ask if a friend would be able to order your pizza over the phone but have it delivered to your address. (Some places places allow it and others need to have the cardholder present). It's been touch-and-go with my experience but I'd rather send pizzas than egift-cards.  edit2: gone to buy pizza in person. no internet on phone. will continually check when I get back.	True
t3_ilubb	1310332363.0	Rollout	Rollout	Our verification system is up and running. (more details inside)	Before anyone tells us this, we know it is not fool proof. Our hope is that this will discourage a lot of people from gaming the system. As snang put it, if someone goes through all the trouble to fool this for a 10 dollar pizza let em have it.....  The way it works is simple. If a giver wants a verification from a person who requests, the requester goes to the site, enters their email, and gets a code. They then give this code to the giver.   The only info the giver sees is the email address, and how many times a person is suspected of getting a pizza. The info is based upon many factors, ip address, cookies, browser type, OS, and more. Givers can see if the person just got the code, as it will say requests in the hour, and the day, and so on, and have a history of other requests if applicable....  **This is not mandatory use ** it is just an optional system for people to use to help circumvent abuse.    I hope by saying we know this is not fool proof, but is an improvement, will keep the griping to a minimum.   Special thanks to our programmer rikbrown  This is housed at http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com      Let us know of any problems you may have.   Ninja edit: I would like to point out that after careful discussion on all this, we did decide, and made it so, that all info collected is encrypted, and can not be viewed by anyone (not even us).

t3_ilryc	1310326021.0	MegainPhoto	shroom	[REQUEST] A pizza would make my wait for Friday (payday) a lot more bearable [Kansas City-ish]	**EDIT**: [flamingcow](http://www.reddit.com/user/flamingcow) has graciously offered a gift card, so please consider this **Request filled** and see the other requests in the queue. Thanks flamingcow!  First off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you'd rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.    I've been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I'm not sure how much the year-long gap of "employment" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven't been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that's physically killing me (ok, it's only very painful). So I'll have something coming my way soon.    In the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I've been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won't starve, but I damn sure don't have a meal I'm actually looking forward to for the next week.    It's just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I'd love another pet, I know I'm not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I've been having.    I'm not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You'll also see where I've sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it's not a matter of "need it or I'll die", but I figure if I'm just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.    Either way, if you're still reading, you're a good person for even considering helping someone out. Thanks for being part of what makes reddit awesome.	True

I am married and although my husband works FT, we fell behind on rent this month when he went to the hospital with chest pain. We're getting the *warning* letters from the Landlord. We're paying them Friday, but a pizza would really cheer us up. I'm working on my degree in Psychology so I can help others. Again, we're not poor and there are probably others that are in greater need, so please help them first. Its just really hard being unemployed and late on the rent. I am thankful for what we do have so if someone helps, great. If not, that's understandable.  Can send a picture of the letter if needed for verification.	True

t3_ikru0	1310197990.0	freefaith	FAP	The best random can get.	So I have seen many offer, request, and thank you threads but have not seen as many real "Random" acts of pizza. I feel as though these are more planned out asking for something giving to someone that wants one. Not very random to me. So I went out today before work and went to the pizza hut in my town and bought some couples lunch. I am going to do it again tomorrow but this time I want to just offer some random person I meet in town out to lunch for a pizza. Or just leave a card. I am creating one as I type, just trying to think of what to put on here. I am hoping more people see this and want to do the same, its the random acts of pizza in me and I want to make a difference.   A couple things to people that want to do this. If you feel shy about any of this just do what I did at first just hold out a 20 and tell them to pay for a ticket around that amount or something to that extent or if you want to help but feel even more shy about it pm me and we can talk further.   I want this to extend to everyone having a shitty day that helping out someone who doesn't expect this and leaving a card that shows that some kindness is left in the world is all some people need to keep trudging their day. So lets get Random!  Here is the rough draft for the card I will leave.   http://i.imgur.com/2vyPV.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/pfESe.jpg  EDIT: Walked into Pizza hut today and looked around, there was a couple sitting next to the wall that I could barely see. Found my prey. Waitress walked up and I told her I would like to pay for their meal. Anything I should tell them? Just give them this *hands card over*. Thank you. Left.	True

t3_ik2xk	1310138813.0	momof2inms	shroom	(REQUEST) Family in Ms could use a little lift	EDIT: I have been offered pizza for my family, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  I'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.  My husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the "world" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.  I applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.  Anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.  We are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.  I'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.  I want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.  I'm not sure what kind of proof I could give? His checks are direct deposited with no stubs mailed yet. Let me know what I need, I can try to figure out something to prove if requred.	True
t3_ijyyg	1310129259.0	abjackso	shroom	[Request] Thought we would make it until payday then car trouble...	I posted yesterday but a very nice lady from work knew I was having some financial trouble and got us food for last night. So I deleted my request. Today we are back in the same boat. Like I stated yesterday, this is out of my comfort zone because I am usually the one trying to help somebody. My husband was laid off about 3 months ago and we usually are able to make it from check to check. I also take care of my Grandmother how is disabled. But this week has been rough. My car broke down on Tuesday. Had to get a new battery and a couple of other small parts to get it back running. This set us back. We are now Broke. We are going to try to have a yard sale tomorrow to get up a little money but have nothing for tonight. I am more than willing to pay this forward when I get paid again next Friday July 15. Thanks for your consideration.	True

t3_ijl4m	1310087430.0	jennythegeneral	shroom	Broke girl in Brooklyn; was able to stave off asking for three days now	[Request] Hi everyone. This is really embarrassing, as I consider myself to be very self-sufficient. I'm a full-time student who lost her full-time job in late April and my unemployment just covers my rent, bills, transportation costs and very little food. It has been a rough two months, trying to hold down mostly unreliable waiting or catering gigs. So you can imagine how much of a godsend this was when I saw this website on a newscast the day I had to fork over rent. I was able to stave this request off for three days without a dollar to my name and twenty-five dollars short on my rent. I have been living off of rice and an old bag of semi-sweet morsels. The rice has run out, and if I eat literally one more morsel, I may go into diabetic shock. So if anyone can spare a pizza, even just a personal pan if you can, I would appreciate it so much. I will walk the seven blocks to Papa John's if selected to get one. And when my next unemployment check comes in, I swear that I will sponsor someone's pizza. Two more days!  Thank you so much. And bless the person whose genius idea this beautiful site was. Have a good night!	True

t3_iioa5	1310007067.0	mikkjel	pizza	[Offer]Pizza for clever person or clever person's person	I recently found random acts of pizza after I mistook it for "random facts of pizza" on [this poster](http://i.imgur.com/rS8hw.png). The problem is that I am 1) Norwegian (so dont live close to most redditors) and 2) on holiday in Canada without the authenticator required to pay with my visa card. I am therefore posing a challenge:  If you need a pizza and can find a clever way to pay for it with PayPal, I'll buy you a pizza.  If you don't need a pizza and can find a clever way to pay for it with PayPal, I'll buy a pizza for a person of your choice. PM me with pizza details of post in the thread. If you don't, I'll chose a suitable candidate.  Lastly, it would be nice to get some links together on the sidebar to help people pay with paypal, which makes it a lot easier for us european redditors to help with pizzas overseas.  EDIT: challenge update:   1) To qualify, I must be able to pay for the pizza with only a paypal account and a computer with an internet connection, and the receiving redditor doesn't have to do anything but pick up or receive the pizza.  2) It can use an intermediary site, but the site must not take a high transaction fee (whether or not it is reasonable will be determined by me).  3) For each month the challenge goes unsolved, another pizza will be added to the prize. If someone actively does something to make it possible (start a chain of pizzerias that accepts paypal, makes a pizzapaymentplan for paypal online OSTTE) they will receive double pizzas.  As of posting the challenge, Domino's pizza Israel and UK are paypal friendly.	True
t3_iimr9	1310003356.0	lkv001	shroom	Family in a really tough time financially until the 22nd	REQUEST: I am a pregnant mom of two little boys.  I am married to a hard working, wonderful man, who won't be off work tonight until midnight.  He works long hours making $2.13 an hour plus tips, but recently he hasn't been making as much as he used to due to the place doing poorly.  I have never been in such a tight financial situation before.  We've never gotten any type of assistance or food stamps or anything like that, and I've NEVER asked anyone for help, but a friend of mine told me about this website and I figured I wasn't too proud to give it a try.  We are in the process of buying our first home in a better area for our children.  On the 22nd of July is our scheduled closing, and we haven't used ANY money from our last two paychecks so that we could scrounge up the last $1800 of our closing costs and downpayment for our home.  We paid our earnest money and appraisal amount already, but this is the last we have to pay.  I currently have $1783 to my name, with our next check coming on the 20th. We have been sweating this closing for months now hoping it all goes correctly, but we have been cutting all kinds of corners to make it happen.  Our mortgage officer told us we weren't even allowed to get a credit card during the time because one change in credit could make it all fall through!  We have been eating Ramen noodles, water, and milk for two months now - no kidding!  We are doing all we can for ourselves, but I would love to have an actual DINNER.  My pregnant belly and two little boys would appreciate it more than you ever know.  I just keep telling myself we have to make it through this month and then we'll SAVE money owning a home... but things have been so so tough.  If anyone helped us out, I would forever appreciate it and definitely pay it forward to another person in the near future!  I remember two years ago I ordered pizza for a friend of mine that was a single mother in another state... I had no idea places like this even existed... but I promise I will pay this forward!  If I need to provide any type of documentation I most certainly will.	True
t3_iimck	1310002388.0	Smoopid	shroom	{Request} Pizza for My family and I in Hervey Bay, Queensland. Australia.

My family (Wife and 2 lovely daughters) and I  have moved states and are having a terrible time finding a job. We are somehow scraping by and keeping up to date with our bills but meals have slowly become frugal affairs ( Still healthy ) but rice and vege's with maybe 1 - 2 times a week a little meat can get old real fast.  I would love to surprise my family with a delicious Pizza and hopefully in the not too distant future be able to give back to RAOP and keep this awesome subreddit alive.  Thankyou Redditors :) And a special thanks to the creator of RAOP!! Awesome idea. (Gives me hope for humanity)	True

t3_ii62n	1309965890.0	Rollout	Rollout	My new idea to further lower our chances of being scammed.	I already posted this in r/favors [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/ii5sc/we_need_a_little_programminghtml_help_over_in/) ...   While we still have far more being helped than the amount of scammers, it is getting annoying (understatement of the year) getting pm's, and mod messages constantly with suspected scammers (most are not).   My idea (in case you didn't want to click the favors link) is this:    verify ip's. We have a site we can host this on.  The idea is to have the requester of the pizza go to the site, enter their email address, the site auto grabs the ip, and gives the person a code. The person gives the code to the person who offers the pizza, and they can see the history of that ip address...  I think it should be simple, but I am not sure how to do it.  While we KNOW this will not deter all, it should take care of most....  If anyone here knows, please let me know, and write it up.   As always we welcome ideas, and feedback from the community.  Edit: we are also trying to implement unique browser hashes to the data ( please don't ask me exactly how this is done, that is why we recruited help), which will be harder to trick than the ip. Between the two we should have some positive results.	True

t3_ihoap	1309913488.0	Doombuggyman	shroom	Something of a rant...	First, I want to say that I believe in my heart that there are some good, honest, decent folks out there, and a lot of them are on Reddit... even hanging out here.  And there are a lot of trolls, too.  This is for them:  Guys, a lot of the people requesting Pizzas here are genuinely hungry.  Some of us are tight on money and can't afford it ourselves, or even to go to the grocery store.  You might think you're being funny or cute to offer pizzas and then reneg on your offer (or worse, send an eGift card and then cancel it. You'll be pleased to know that I was pretty embarassed on that one).  The thing is... when you offer a pizza, plans change. I've turned down offers of food from friends or family members because I thought a good samaritan was doing something nice for a stranger.  And when nothing happens... well, it's embarassing for me (especially when I tell my wife and toddler "Can we wait a bit longer before giving up? We should be getting a code for pizza any minute now...").  Anyway... the reason I'm writing this is because I think the trolling is getting out of hand here. Over the past few weeks I've had four offers for pizza, and of the four, **ONLY ONE** was genuine.  I just got trolled again tonight. This time, my 2 year old son wound up going to bed without supper.  Folks, it's just **not funny**.  And RAOP isn't fun anymore.  **EDIT:** Actually, my wife and son are with her folks now getting some food. So there's that, at least.  **EDIT 2:** I've had several very generous offers as a result of this thread. As I've said, I've made alternate plans for myself tonight (and I'm getting ready to head on out), but I also see a lot of other hungry folks out there.  Please consider extending your generosity out to them.  **FINAL EDIT:** Somehow, this thread has degenerated into a screed about my financial situation or parenting ability. That was not my intent -- nor is this post about karma or getting offers of pizza (every one of which, while GREATLY appreciated, has been declined).  My entire point is (and always has been) that if you make a **promise** to send a pizza, please do so.   It's not about being upset that a [REQUEST] was ignored. That wouldn't have bothered me.  It's not about being upset that replies to [OFFER]s were ignored.  Again, that wouldn't have bothered me.  It's about promises being made (causing me to stop looking for other alternatives) and then *broken* after stringing me along for *hours.*  And that's not cool.	True
t3_ihkcg	1309904134.0	blthomas09	shroom	New here, but looking for a well deserved meal for my family tomorrow	[REQUEST] Van Nuys, CA  I am hoping someone can save us from the usual TOP RAMEN or MAC and CHEESE dinner tomorrow night. I am an only working parent with my two little boys, ages 3 and 6. I barely made enough in my check to pay the bills and we have been stuck eating top ramen and mac and cheese for literally almost 2 weeks. I feel horrible for my boys, especially my oldest one, whom I promised if he finished 1st grade with good grades, he would get a fabulous pizza dinner. I just havent been able to afford it and I feel sometimes as a failure to my kids. I am trying so hard but times are tough. Maybe if someone could help us out and buy my family of 4 a pizza and, maybe breadsticks (my boys' favorite) I would forever be grateful. I wouldnt be home to receive the pizza until 6 or 630 Pacific time tomorrow. I also heard they allow people to buy E gift cards from like papa johns and others. That would work too. Thank you for reading :)	True
t3_ihhbr	1309897894.0	YepImBroke	shroom	[Request] Hoping for some pizza for myself and my fiancee	Before I start, allow me to say that I do realize that I am new here. I am not someone who is out to score a free meal, I am honestly looking for some help right now.  OK so here is my story. I apologize in advance for the giant wall-of-text.  A couple of months ago our ceiling caved in, due to excessive rain and the landlord's refusal to fix the leak. We had been telling him for months that it was not fixed and it was still leaking, but he didn't care.  So the night that the ceiling caved in, I called the landlord and I told him politely, "hey, your ceiling just fell in on us"  His exact words, were "I don't really give a damn, I don't care about anything since you said you don't owe me any money"  Now this is funny, because for years this landlord would come around EVERY YEAR at tax time, and insist we owed him some insane amount of money. We had just been agreeing in the past, because it was possible we might have missed some payments here or there.  But this time was different. He claimed we owed him 3,400 dollars for 8 months of rent that we supposedly never paid him. So I tell him, give me the dates that you think we didn't pay, and I will run them against my receipts and see what's going on.  Well, when I finally get the dates, I cross-reference them to my receipts. And it turned out that we had actually OVER-PAID the landlord by 750 dollars - plus we had all the paperwork to prove it.  So I try to explain the situation with the guy, and he refuses to listen. So he files an eviction.  We go to court with photographs of the ceiling caved in that he refused to fix, the stack of receipts, his dates that he claimed we never paid - EVERYTHING.  Well the judge's exact words were "I'm not too good with numbers, so we aren't going to get in to your stack of receipts"  The landlord also claimed that he never got the money orders, so I contacted Western Union, and I had them send me the front AND backs of them to show who they were made out to, and who signed and cashed them. Even after seeing these, he STILL claimed in front of the judge that he never got them - But they were clearly signed by him!!!  So the judge gave us 72 hours to get our shit and get out, when we were legally paid up for another 2 months........  So I had to spend 200 dollars on a storage unit, and we packed our entire lives into it. At this point, we are literally homeless. So I get a hotel room for myself, my fiancee, and our chocolate lab for the next week, just to have somewhere to sleep at night.  So that's another 200 dollars gone when we were actually paid up on the apartment and were wrongfully evicted.  After about 4 days in the hotel, we came in contact with the lady we are renting from now - she had a house available, this house - But it's 500 dollars/month for rent, plus utility costs...  Either way, we can't live out of a hotel at 200 dollars per week. So we agree and move in.  The house doesn't have a refrigerator, it doesn't have a washer/dryer. So we lived out of a cooler for the first month that we got here, until we were able to buy a cheap 75 dollar refrigerator.  This story just keeps going on & on & on.. I honestly couldn't type this whole thing out unless I wrote for a month.. This whole situation has just been insane.  Bottom line, I hate to ask for help. Especially like this..   But I do have photos of the entire process. From moving our things into storage to us living out of the hotel room, all the way up until we found this house, to today's rent payment.. I have the photos.. I have the receipts, I have everything...  So, the reason I am asking today is because we just spent our last 500 dollars that we had in the bank on the rent for the next month.  Neither of us gets paid for another 2 weeks.  If anyone can afford like 20 dollars or something so I could surprise her when she gets home from work with a pizza, some cheese sticks and a 2 liter of pepsi, that would be awesome.   As far as proof goes, I can provide a scanned copy of the money order for the rent that I just sent out today, it was our last drop of money. (After we were evicted illegally, I now scan the front of the money order before sending them to prove who they were made out to if any disputes should ever come up.)  I would of course blank the recipient's name out, along with the address. But I would highlight the date it was purchased (today) so you can see that I'm not just making up some sob story. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried...  So anyway, again I apologize for the huge wall of text. If someone can help us, I deeply appreciate it and thank you in advance. If not, well at least I tried. It's better to try and fail, than not try and wonder what may have happened.  EDIT: To make it easier for people who are interested in possibly helping, I have blanked-out the money order and uploaded it.   You can see it here: http://tinypic.com/r/25evg55/7  EDIT EDIT: ThumpingArnt helped me already, thank you so much.. I'm speechless right now.. 	True

I have been reading through the requests and IMO it is kind of saddening that about 90%+ of the postings have been posted by someone just jumping in here asking for a free pizza with about a 1 line description.  I understand that this is where people come to ask for help, but I feel like there should be a little more effort put into it than "hungry please help." I would like to offer a pizza to a couple people/families.  Remember that first impressions are everything.  Give me some background about yourself, your situation, and just shoot me some proof.  If it is personal for you, you can send me a message, but I will require that you post in here along with your message so that your account is linked here in a post for future reference of who received a pizza.  Along with the other information I asked for please send your email and preferred pizza place if chosen.   I will be responding to everyone around 6pm PST.

t3_iggaq	1309794786.0	PlzThink	pizza	[Offer] I'm in TN but, using the email-gift-card system, anywhere in the US will work. Happy 4th of July.	I recently found this community, and immediately fell in love with it. Two things I love are acts of kindness, and pizza. So obviously, I felt like RAOP was pretty much the coolest thing ever. (Mad props to the creators, moderators, and contributors.)  I just got paid, and would love to help someone out with a hot pizza for the 4th. So here it is, someone's gonna eat pizza tonight, on me.  **However**, I feel like there are WAAAAYYY too many people trying to take advantage of the generosity of the awesome contributors here at RAOP. So, that being said, if you have an account that is only a few hours/days old, don't even bother commenting here unless you're willing to provide some sort of proof that you're in need of a meal, and not just trying to score a free meal that you can afford but don't want to pay for yourself. That might seem cynical and callous, but it's how I feel. Nearly every [Request] post on the front page is from a brand new account. Some have even received pizza and have already posted asking for more. I don't trust it. So I'm going to check the history of the people asking for a meal, and if it doesn't seem legit, you're not getting a pizza from me, sorry.   But if a legit Redditor needs a meal, or a newbie can provide proof, don't hesitate. I would love to help.

I'm not sure how this works or really what I'm doing. Basically, I was really stupid, and somehow left my refrigerator door open, and my electricity bill went from around $40 to an unexpected $100. I'm honestly not sure what I'm going to do about food in the upcoming week, since I'm out the grocery money I was expecting. I have about 15$ in my wallet, but until they 15th I won't have a paycheck to do anything else. Please let me know if I have to do anything to prove this. I'm embarrassed that I have to beg. To be honest, my stomach hurts today from eating only bread that I froze to make it last longer.  Best regards,  Allen  Thank you DundahMifflin, because of you I will have something tasty to eat for a couple days. I really appreciate it so much. It's so nice to see a community like this.	True

t3_ifrfv	1309715942.0	yatahazio	shroom	[Request] KC Area - Broke, hungry, and alone over the holiday weekend. Someone suggested this to me so I figured I'd give it a shot.	I'm fearful of being labeled a scammer or something after reading a lot of the other posts here, but I assure you this is genuine. My wife of 3 years left me and took our 11 month old daughter a few days ago. She didn't take too kindly to me finding out she was cheating on me. As bad as that is, she took our EBT card right before we were to go grocery shopping, leaving me heartbroken, alone, and without food with a week to go before my next paycheck. My stomach growling is honestly the least of my problems at this point, but I was told this would be a good place to try to get some dinner and solve at least one of my issues, or at least an open ear. I'm going to spend quite a bit of time on here today, as the sense of community throughout the entire site is quite impressive and will hopefully serve as a distraction to what I have going on. Thanks for reading, and I hope whatever deity you follow blesses you in every way possible.  Edit - Thanks to miafria! What a great community and people. 	True

t3_iefba	1309546000.0	Psysiphea	shroom	[REQUEST] Prepare to be aplomb with sob-story...	I have bad luck. Not just any bad luck, but the kind of bad luck that comes from a) either trying to be a good person and help people out or b) the kind of stupidity that can only result from people taking advantage of you.   About three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and "needed" to move out of her mother's house.   Unfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for "extras" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a "payment plan" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity.   Apartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud.   She still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings.   Every word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to "pay" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it.   My parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.  My history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.  I have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job.   In August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me.   The financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own.   Just recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month.   It is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards.   With vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything.   By the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. <3   EDIT: I am going to school for graphic design, I don't know much about reddit yet but if you want a graphic made for you to display, I'd be happy to do it in a repayment of faith and support for RAOP members. :) 	True

t3_idwr2	1309493129.0	Cacoo	pizza-gold	RAOP questions for a newbie	Hi all. I've been a lurker on Reddit for a bit now. I've come across these RAOP post here and there and they have really motivated me to try and do the same for someone else. I just have some questions on how to get started. As someone that is offering to purchase pizza for someone else, how do you typically go about doing so? Ask the requester for email address and try sending a gift card to their email address? Is this the 'best practice'/easiest way? Do you ask for actual address and where they would like the pizza from and call the pizza place yourself and place order over the phone? Sorry for the questions, but I get paid tomorrow from my job and am really eager to help out some other people that could use it, so would like to know how to best make a RAOP go as smooth as possible.

t3_idljj	1309466949.0	Elleyena	PIF	(Request) Athens, GA - College student in a bind - will pay forward	EDIT: CayucosKid was kind enough to buy me a couple pizzas, they just showed up and not only taste amazing, but will feed me for the rest of the weekend. Thank you so much.  So, my roommate had told me about this Reddit, and I had planned to keep it in mind to give other people pizza every once in a while. I wasn't planning on using this for me...but I'm in a really tough situation right now.  A little background: I had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when I lost my dining hall job. I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is "always hiring" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food. I've been surviving off the kindness of my landlord/roommates, (I do dishes I don't have to pay for food) but that can only go so far. I'm attempting to go back to school so I don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven't been getting the best hours.  According to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it's probably on it's last legs, and today I didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so I don't get any bonuses. Overall everything's just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I'll be able to cover everything then. It's just been a really rough day and I could use a meal that I didn't have to cook myself today.	True

Would anyone care to show me some pizza love?  Fair warning: I may decide to try to talk you out of it if you try to help... don't let me. It's something between pride and optimism... :)  **EDIT**: Request fulfilled. Thanks to dihydrogen_monoxide	True
t3_id7yh	1309440094.0	Hi_Im_yogibear	shroom	[Request] for a pizza in Scotland.	Hi, not something I have done ever, but here it goes.  I got done with my exams 2 weeks ago and wasn't able to work as much as I would have wanted to during this past 30 days, after paying off my rent all my bills, I have just been left enough money for the bus fare to and from work for the next week and I can't spend that, I've got some rice and bread and PB and stuff, but that's only enough to last me a few days, so I was wondering if anyone could buy me a papa johns? That would be a nice fulfilling meal for a change.  Since I get paid in 8 days, i.e next Friday, I promise to pass the pizza love to someone who need's it like I do now, I guess that's the whole point of this subreddit.  Anyway, thanks for reading.   **EDIT: Pictures.**  http://i.imgur.com/zghop http://imgur.com/sJSnC http://i.imgur.com/HWG8l http://imgur.com/J1qUI	True

Albeit that even though I had exhausted my resources (from borrowing $200 from a co-worker, and even went to the Navy Marine Corps Releif Society a month earlier) I was shot down by some well-meaning redditor when I made my last request.

t3_icay5	1309356794.0	discrepancy09	pizza	[REQUEST] A Pizza from Reddit would help, but anything is good	**Tl;DR at the bottom**  You may know me as the guy who got sent grape kool-aid. But that's all in the past now, it's time to get fersrs. So, here's my situation. Well, first some backstory. If ya don't want backstory, skip to the bold text.  When graduated from high school (two years ago) my father kicked me out right after summer vacation was over. Why? Because I didn't have a job. I HAD a job, that I ended up leaving after a year, got hired back, and then fired (the manager fired me after a month, I believe it was just revenge.) So, because I was no longer giving him half my paychecks, he decided to run off to another city with his new wealthy girlfriend and left me to do whatever I do. My mother was in KY (I went with her for a month, but she too sent me back upstate after I couldn't find a job in a month.) so that was out of the question. I bounced around from house to house, but thankfully my fairly new girlfriend helped me out. About 2-3 months later, I got hired at Target. After saving up a little money, my girlfriend and I (she was 17, I was 19) got a place together and signed a 6 month lease, just to see how it would go. It went pretty well, but close to the end of my lease, a manager started to take up a grudge with me (still not sure why) and pick on me for very very little things. I was eventually fired (yes, fired) for riding on a cart after closing for about 5 seconds. (not overexaggeratng, that's exactly what happened.) Luckily this coincided with the end of my lease, so I figured with the little money I had saved, plus the return of my deposit, I could live off of that until I had another job. Of course, we ended up not getting the deposit back on some shady landlord shit (another story all together) So I once again stayed with my girlfriend and her crazy mother. I stayed there for about 2-3 months and then they decided to move. So I helped them find a really good place for a really good deal. During the moving process, she had one of her crazy moments, so I left and went to a friend's house for a while. ended up coming back because I was supposed to pay for food (I had foodstamps) and watch the dog while they were at work, to do my share. I looked for multiple jobs during my stay there, probably got about 4-5 interviews, and they all fell through or didn't receive callbacks. The mother went crazy on me again (as I knew she would) and kicked me out, again. So I came back to live with my friend.  **Here's my dilemma**  I'm staying with the friend, and his girlfriend. I don't want to be staying here. I mean, they're cool and I get internet and stuff, but their style of living is completely different from mine. They order fast food all the time, which I basically have to eat because my foodstamps got cut off last month. They hardly ever buy groceries, and the house is a mess. Also, they have bedbugs, which is super duper annoying. I've now been 6 months unemployed, still putting in applications but just can't seem to catch a break. As I stated before, my foodstamps got cut off so I now have no means to supplement myself. My girlfriend paid my phone bill last month, but I told her never to do it again and just let it get cut off if I can't pay it this month. She's been paying for way too much this past 8 months (she paid off my old school fees from high school and everything for prom and homecoming so I could go with her.) and I just can't let her do it anymore.  TL;DR So, no job for 8 months, can hardly feed myself, and currently getting bitten by bedbugs and surviving on charity fast food. I just got turned down for another two jobs (Smoothie shop and McDonalds, wtf) and really, any help would be helpful, be it pizza, job advice...clothes, lol. Thanks in advance.  Edit; Last month was the last month I could pay my phone bill. It's getting cut off at the end of this month. Which means I won't be able to call jobs because I have no cellphone.	True

My husband does the best he can to "bring home the bacon" but we recently had a second baby (our first is 3 now) and paying the medical bills for that has totally wiped us out. We are struggling to just pay the basic bills right now (mortgage, electric, water, etc.) and getting very minimal food with our tiny budget. We would love to have a hot pizza for dinner instead of the old rice and beans we have been eating for weeks now (with the ocassional spaghetti thrown in). I just scored a part-time job and I start Saturday, so as soon as I start getting paid there, I would love to pay it forward with pizza ;D TIA!

t3_iboht	1309296592.0	Hagane17	shroom	[REQUEST] Mishawaka, IN. Unemployed and coming  off one of the worst months in my life.	As the title says. I've been living off of a pack of ramen a day. Things took a bad turn at the beginning of this month. A quick look through my posts can show you that. I'm unemployed, and looking for work. The only money I get is just enough to pay my bills and get what little bit of food I can. Its kinda nice cause I'm losing weight (was about 245ish, now 230) But, I haven't had a good slice of 'za in forever.   I do completely plan on helping someone out at some point when I'm back on my feet, regardless if I get a pizza today or not. I have followed and watched this subreddit for sometime, and I honestly hate to have a need to use it, But, I'm honestly sick of Ramen.  Edit: WOW, and Within an hour I'm waitin for Pizza. as I'm waitin, Pizza hut calls me and says "Hey, We sent you the wrong 2nd pizza, Keep it, we are sending your 2nd pizza as well, Have three pizzas!" WHAT! Something or someone is smiling on me tonight. [I took some pictures to immortalize this moment.](http://imgur.com/a/FedCs) I'm honestly dumbfounded by the generosity I got.	True
t3_ibj0m	1309286056.0	littleodie914	pizza	[offer] Who needs some 'za?	Hey redditors! Long time lurker, found RAOP, decided to make an account.  I develop an app in my free time (I won't say which) and it has treated me pretty well. As a recent college grad, I've eaten my share of ramen. I'm lucky enough to have a full-time job that's my main source of income, so I'd like to toss a little extra to someone who needs it. No need to PIF, just looking for dudes/dudettes in need.  I think the easiest way would be to email a few gift certificates, so if you're in need, give me the link to a local/national chain that offers online gift cards in your area, and I'll shoot a few out.  **EDIT:** As mentioned below, thanks for the warm welcome. Got 4 happy families a pizza. (Well, 1 pizza, 3 gift cards. Maybe they maxed out on bread sticks? I don't judge.) Hope to see you again soon!	True

Also I am based in Oslo so I'll do my best to order anywhere in the world but may be limited to chains that offer gift cards / e-pizza.  Update: Overwhelming response. We're reading through submissions here and by PM. Apparently the US won't accept our €urodollars, but we're fixing it. Might be some delays because of it.  Update 2: When sending details please send name, email, phone # and address + any pizza type and/or store preference. If no pizza type given it will likely be hot and meaty.  Update 3: It's getting late here in Oslo so I'm off for the night. Sorry I haven't gotten back to more of you but I have discovered ordering pizza internationally is quite time consuming (sorry rolmos, it seems impossible). I'll pick up the thread in the morning so vote up anyone you think needs pizza and I'll follow up later. Thanks.  Update 4: Alright guys. We are wrapping things up now and getting back to our "day jobs" so thats it from us for now.

t3_ianl1	1309207033.0	PastafarianTwit	FSM	For all the new people on the topic of eGiftCards...	* Unfortunately, to date, they are US only.  You can only purchase them with a US address and can only use them from the US.  I'm pretty sure of this, but feel free to correct me.  * If this is your first time purchasing, you may be asked to verify through CashStar (the gift card processing company)  * You will get emails for each stage of processing your order.  * Orders can take anywhere from 10 minutes to overnight (The longest I've personally experienced is 2 hours).  If it's during their customer service hours, you may be able to contact a customer service agent to get your order expedited if it's taking too long.  *International Gifting Notes:*  *  It is possible to gift out of country, there have been several success stories.  In my case, I called up the pizza place in Canada and asked them if I could gift to a friend and they said, "As long as you give me your permission to charge your card right now, then we're all set."  In my case, this place was Pizza Pizza in Canada.  There have been other success stories of placing online orders at the websites of other countries too.  When in doubt, just call up the pizza place.  Also, a lot of local joints are happy to work with you, too.    * [Just-Eat](http://www.just-eat.ca/) is a great choice for gifting to Canada, too.  Thanks Amaya69!  Anything else experienced gifters feel should be added, comment below and I will edit this post!  edit: Rollout's point on international gifting.  edit2: Adding Amaya69's Canada tip!

t3_iamq6	1309205316.0	geeklove1013	shroom	[request] pizza for a couple having a rough month in Kenora, Ontario, Canada?	I am just now finding this subreddit and boy did it come at the perfect time. At the beginning of the month, my father passed away, leaving my husband and I to beg off family to pay for the plane ticket to Texas. Worth it to say goodbye to my daddy, but still horrible. When we got back my husband discovered he was not being hired as a teacher at the school he worked at for the following year because he wasn't catholic enough (yes, it was a Catholic school board). This after two years of working for this board, being an active member of the school community, and being loved by all of the students and their parents. He was devastated. Right now he is sitting at the kitchen table filling out application after application... We have $20 inour bank account and his last paycheck, coming in two weeks has to be spent for our big move to Toronto in a month. I am unemployed (I'm immigrating to Canada and they haven't issued a work visa yet) and just want to see my husband have something super neat and nice happen. Earlier he came into the room and said he wished we could order a pizza... Half an hour later I found this!  I'm willing to provide any proof you ask for and as soon as we are on our feet again I wOuld love to return the favor! Is there anyone willing to give a random act of pizza to a couple looking to smile at least once this month?!  UPDATE: Dinner box arrived! Here are some pictures of my husband and I with our amazing treat from Belgar! My husband was so freakin' surprised! It was awesome! So thank you for totally making out evening!!

t3_i9w6y	1309134788.0	maddexx	shroom	[Request] No money, laid off, fiance stressed. Will gift a few games on steam for a pizza or two, and also post happy pics and love you forever.	Hello! I was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up.  So my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.  Anyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.  I have these: HL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam Edit: I also have some Wii games(and GC games as I've been trying to sell it all for money). Mario galaxy 2, mario bros wii, and a ton of GC games. Paper mario, luigis mansion, zelda, the good stuff.   I also have Reddit friends that could confirm what I've said above^ So I don't look like some random dude just wanting free food.

Short version of my sob story:  We receive food stamps (husband laid off, both of us also working on our bachelors degrees) which honestly keeps us through the month pretty well.

And unfortunately I got into a small accident last weekend, so any money I come across has to go toward repairing my car.  If some kind soul could bless me with a large pizza or send me a Pizza Hut gift card I will return the favor as soon as I can, either to the donator or to someone else in need (their choice).  I'm having bloodwork done tomorrow in the same town with the Pizza Hut, so I can pick it up then!  That would make my week.  Possibly my month, since the whole car thing was quite shitty.

t3_i6ihq	1308774367.0	RRSignalMaintainer	shroom	{Request} Wrecked my car last weekend while up north, spent the last of my money paying a deposit for a rental car.  Eating toast two days in a row is getting old...  In West Michigan. 	All I have at home is a loaf of bread, since I was on vacation when the accident happened (as typical in Michigan, a deer decided to do a few cartwheels over the two-week old car).  Luckily insurance is covering the car, but since I don't have a credit/debit card, I had to pay the deposit in cash, depleting all my money until Friday when I get paid again. To make matters worse, the rental car they gave me is a baby blue Nissan Versa, which is embarrassing as hell to drive.  I am in Grand Haven, MI and was wondering if there was any way I could get just a basic pepperoni pizza.  The only chain places are Jets, Pizza Hut, and Dominoes (and Dominoes last I knew used one of those carbon copy things the driver carried for the CC since they demand the person with the card to be here).  I WILL pay it forward after I get paid on Friday.  I am just slightly sick of having toast and butter the past two days...	True

UPDATE: Just remembered that I have a $25 gift card to a TGI Fridays that I can't get to because it is too far away, will totally trade it!  Also I live in Portland OR if that means anything, anyone know good dumpster diving places around here?	True
t3_i5qwr	1308702798.0	ajelizalde	shroom	[Request] Who would like to donate a pizza for a good me and my poor buddy?

t3_i5ilz	1308685025.0	eternalkerri	shroom	[Request] Had to cover bill my roommate forgot to pay before leaving the country.  Now broke until the 30th.  I promise to pay forward.	My roommate forgot to pay the power bill before leaving the country for a trip to Peru.  I ended up having to drop my last 250 bucks to pay the bill and the reconnect fee.  That would have easily gotten me through the reset of the month.  I have a little food left in the house and enough left over for gas for work, but It wont make it to the end of the month.  If I could get a little help here, I promise to pay it forward the minute I get paid.  **EDIT**  I scrounged up some food, so misfit-zero who offered to help is off the hook.  Told him to find someone else in need of assistance.	True
t3_i5c8j	1308671930.0	Sublime1996	shroom	[Request]  Denver student getting back on my feet after being away at school.  Also currently babysitting 2 nieces w/o pay	**Edit:**  I received a gift card from a fellow redditor.  Thank you so much for the generosity!  I will definitely pay it forward when I get a chance.  I was out of state for a semester of school and returned a few weeks ago.  I was finally offered a job on Friday but I still have to wait for background checks to go through before I can officially start next week (or so).  I'm babysitting my nieces for my brother who happens to work at a dealership across from my apartment so any food will go towards feeding the girls and my brother as well.  My brother is also trying to get back on his feet as well after a divorce so he is unable to pay me for watching the kids.  Now, after that sob story, I will say we are not DYING for food.  If you find someone else in greater need, by all means help them first.  Food would greatly help me save money until I officially start my job, considering I still have to wait another 2-3 weeks for a paycheck to come in.  If I do receive any food, I definitely plan to pay it forward once I am more financially stable.    This turned out a whole lot longer than I planned.  I would appreciate any help. Thanks!	True
t3_i4qc0	1308610006.0	Bottleman	PIF	[OFFER] Kind of back on my feet and I'd like to use this chance to pay it forward. 	Although a reason is not needed, it wouldn't hurt. In this thread preferred but a PM will work just as well if you'd rather stay anonymous (But I hope you'll understand if I send your username to a mod, I think they like to keep track on who receives a pizza.)  I can't give out much as I'm still in a bind, but it would clear my conscious knowing that I've finally payed it forward.  EDIT: Sorry guys! Something came up but I should be back in an hourish. Please PM or put a message here anyway so I'll be able to send a Pizza ASAP when I'm back.  **EDIT: Going off to deliver a pizza. So glad they were in my area :), will update to confirm delivery**  **EDIT2: Pizza sent! Really nice guy :) Sucks these kinds of things happen to the best of us**	True
t3_i4kxs	1308598192.0	JafarMayNeedGlasses	shroom	[Request] Redditor friend told me you guys might be able to gimme a hand. 	A friend of mine told me about this subreddit.  Maybe you guys could help me out.  I get by paycheck to paycheck, but I do alright for myself.  I, however, don't get paid until Thursday and I am not too proud to say I could use a pizza to munch on for the next couple of days until I can get to the store.  I have about $10 in my account, so I can get some food, but I also need gas and it's hard realizing that the gas is actually more important than food right now.  I'm in Alabama, if that helps at all.  Edit: Wow... thank you bakersdozen13.  I honestly didn't know what I was expecting, but this immediately fixed my problem for the next couple of days.  I'll be back in here after payday to pay it forward! ^_^  Edit 2:  Just picked everything up... Holy friggin god!  Above and beyond, good ma'am!  I will be back come payday to pay it forward!	True

t3_i3dfu	1308456639.0	hogfathom	pizza	[OFFER] I am currently in a position to send seven pizzas anywhere Papa John's will deliver.	Unfortunately, Papa John's levies a delivery charge so in reality one would have to pay $2.17 for a pizza from me. However, I have accrued enough papa's points to feed some hungry two-dollar-aires. Convince me that you deserve a two-dollar pizza and it's yours.  Another thing: I will only have this ability until June 30 and, as I mentioned in the title, I only have seven. So act fast!

t3_i3abm	1308446668.0	Santabot	shroom	[Request] Pizza Chain Starts here.	I will send someone pizza tonight if another viewer of RAOP will send me pizza, then the next contributor to the previously (confirmed) gifter.  This will create an open chain of known pizza aid, and the benefits will be in the chain's extension to a bracket system. Say the last pizza gifter (who will be next to receive RAOP) wants to pass their offer forward, then the next person who is in need has a known circle to request pizza from, rather than speaking out to the open, naked environment.  I've been reading a lot about forms of gift in societies from an anthropological standpoint, and I feel like this will create a more lasting bond with the pizza aid and community that isn't provided by the *alien* relations of common redditors. I feel like we need to connect more closely and allow more transparency in our relationships to differentiate and grow from those who mask themselves in memes and "novelty" accounts and throwaway tricksters and trolls.  So... TL;DR: who wants pizza? I'm hungry, too! :)  edit- I found food and wine, still ready to feed the first of the chain.	True
t3_i37e6	1308436817.0	redditormom2011	shroom	[REQUEST] Pizza in the USA	Before I begin I would like to apologize for this being a new account.

t3_i2y36	1308408355.0	Rollout	Rollout	Wow how we've grown!!! Some announcements, and more....	In the past month we have really grown, and have seen the offers, and requests stay fairly even. This community is everything, and more, that Gadianton, and I have dreamed of.....   As a lot of you know I have been talking to pizza chains, and CashStar. I have been trying to strike deals with them to make all of our lives easier. So far there has been only a little response, and looking like it will happen, but not going really fast. We hoping this is about to change......read on....  In the past couple days we have done a few interviews with larger news networks. We will reveal the links when the articles are published (should be this coming week).  This will increase our numbers for sure, and could encourage CashStar, and some of the pizza chains, to get on board with us.   So far in this community everyone has done great in sorting the needs, from the ones that don't need. We know it will continue like that.     ** Regarding New accounts**: A new account can be a person in need just as much as an account that has been around for 5 years. If you feel more comfortable in asking the person to provide proof of some kind do so, preferably in private. Please always suggest that they pizza it forward when they can.  While we know a few may try to abuse this system, not many will. We already know that CashStar will let you know if you are trying to give to someone who has received a couple pizza gift cards already.   **---------**  There has been some suggestion lately to bring back the down arrow. I removed it originally due to seeing every post downvoted, sometimes multiple times. The community knows how to downvote if needed, and thus far it seems to have been working great. In my opinion it would be a bad idea to bring it back, but if enough of the community disagrees with me the arrow will reappear.    It has been suggested that we possibly do a pool of pizza cards to be given away when our subscribers hit 5000. Thoughts on this?   Thoughts, and suggestions, as we are about to grow even more in numbers? 	True

It really bums me out, because he's always been poor and has worked tooth and nail to get to where he is now (working several jobs, his girlfriend as well). They just got engaged last Christmas, but things have been rocky since he lost his job and she lost one of hers (long story, but really, just freak reasons as to why it happened).   Reddit, can you help me cheer them up? I don't have the funds right now, because I'm getting screwed by hospital bills that I didn't have insurance for (long story too, haha) and I'm just a server working part time at the moment. Would someone be willing to send him some love-pizza? :)   **EDIT: We live in Kentucky!** And tomorrow would be ideal, haha, not tonight. It's obviously quite late here.

I was expecting to get some money by the end of this month for playing a gig but that got canceled, so all i been eating lately is oranges and boiled potatoes with butter and soy sauce, a pizza would surely make my heart explode.

t3_i2cu1	1308336657.0	balakain	shroom	{Request} Any kind US redditor out there willing to help a hungry couple? 	My husband just got paid today, he was short on work the past week and earned only $300. We basically live paycheck to paycheck, and week by week put however much money is needed for certain bills aside. Well this week we need to put $300 aside for rent. I am not really certain what to do. Can't put that aside because then we wouldn't even have money for gas and things like that. I would hope we could make it up with next weeks check, but what happens if work runs short again? This has been happening for about a month now. Our pantry/fridge isn't completely empty, we've got staple things like bread/milk/eggs/cheese. But I am getting so tired of eating grilled cheese sandwiches..no matter how good they may be sometimes.  Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'd be happy to pay it forward when we've got more money. Sometimes we've got money to spare, sometimes we don't even have enough for ourselves, you never know.  {edit} signgirlamy10 was wonderful enough to help out, big thanks to her!	True

I currently live myself and have been for the past two days since my father was recently hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. I've been mooching off of my friends but having been a lurker and occasional poster of this subreddit for quite some time now, I figured that I might as well try asking a kind redditor for some assistance. When my father is well again, I will explain to him the situation and have him help another redditor in need.  Also, those who are thinking of assisting me, please check the subreddit for others who are actually in need first because I'm sure I can survive half a day without a meal.

t3_i0q9q	1308179188.0	Nazoth	pizza	[Request] shitty day, posting from hospital	Hey RAOP. I love this subreddit and always want to give someone pizza, but someone always beats me to it.  I've been having a shitty day. I'm writng this from my phone while wearing a hospital gown and a hookup for an IV stuck in my arm. I have 32 dollars in the bank and have to pay for therapy tomorrow which will take up the rest of my money for this month. To top it off, I have no insurance, so this hospital trip will cost my family around 9k at least. Awesome.  My boyfriend considered buying pizza but lacks funds as well. I feel terrible as his birthday is on Friday, and I can't treat him to something extravagant, let alone making up for being at the hospital with me.  There's my sob story and pizza would be an awesome pick me up for me and the SO. I promise I will post an offer in RAOP next month when I have money.  PM me and I'll check when I get on to an actual computer to reply. Thanks all &amp;lt;3  Edit: If anyone wants a picture of me in the hospital I can upload and post here just to verify. Technology is cool like that.	True

Plus my husband has had a rough few days at work and is pretty irate about it. If I could coax a pizza out of the universe for them, they'd be so geeked. It doesn't have to be quality.. it just has to relieve the stress for a little while and provide pizza-y goodness.  If you can offer assistance, please PM me and we'll work it out. If not, thanks for reading anyways, and may your pursuit of pizza be rewarded!  EDIT: I've received generous offers from two redditors, and will be posting pics of my family enjoying their dinner ASAP! Thanks, kind people of RAOP!  EDIT 2: Pictures will be posted tomorrow.

t3_i004a	1308109007.0	edify	GREEN	[FYI] Papa John's eGift Card's require phone verification.	I tried to get [texpundit](/user/texpundit) a pizza [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/hzsdy/dead_broke_until_money_transfer_goes_through/) earlier today.  After a long nap, I woke up and asked tex if he had received his pizza yet. He informed me that he had yet to receive an email with his gift card number. I went to check my email and apparently Papa Johns uses a secondary company called CashStar that requires phone verification to approve first time eGift Card purchases. [Here's the email I got](http://i.imgur.com/gZ85T.jpg).  I just approved his eGift Card over the phone, but it is too late for him to order. He ate some of the pasta he mentioned in his post.  **Edit:** From the input I've received, it appears that CashStar customer service is very familiar with [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza). That is awesome. This community has made quite the impact.  **TL;DR** If you are filling a request or offering a pizza, Papa Johns requires phone verification via a 1-800 number after you order the eGift Card. It's easy to do.  Sorry tex!	True
t3_hz7vk	1308034777.0	constantSarcasm	shroom	[REQUEST] Sydney student going through rough patch.	Hey Reddit, I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.  But now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.  I rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.  It's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.  I must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to "pay-it-back" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).    **UPDATE:**  **EDIT: ** Received the Pizza, and it was the most tastiest bloody pizza I have tasted in a long time. **1stGenRex** you are so awesome. Reddit should be proud to have members like you and others who have offered a kindness that literally makes me want to tear up.  Here are some pics. Oh before I forget, **1stGenRex** decided to be extra awesome by spoiling me with a box of [Magnum minis](http://i.imgur.com/0BfhY.jpg) and a pepsi. Here is the evidence that **1stGenRex** is one of the coolest mofo's on Reddit:  [Pic1](http://i.imgur.com/v71mw.jpg)  [Pic2](http://i.imgur.com/lvg0x.jpg)  [Pic3 - With my ugly mug enjoying the hell outta that pizza](http://i.imgur.com/si9Fq.jpg)  Reddit and Random_acts_of_Pizza and **1stGenRex** stay awesome.

t3_hw5vx	1307684103.0	NerdWith_A_Tan	shroom	[request] Have had a run of bad luck in the last few days... Will return the favor next week...	So I had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and I stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading.   He took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.  Today I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives.   Also being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along.   TL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To "protect" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.  edit: never done this so forgive me. forgot to add that im in the san diego area  edit2: RZF291 is a scholar and a gentlemen! Thank you so much again!	True
t3_hw1f8	1307671665.0	Rollout	Rollout	Well good news, and bad news comes in bundles I guess.....	** EDIT : The redditor that is in question has answered to this, and while he did ask twice in need(rather spread the love here, not ask often), some of the pizza cards he got were by accident. After hearing his explanation, and some of the people who helped him out, I am unbanning him, and giving him the benefit of the doubt. For a person to make an account, and go through the explanation he did takes dedication. He even is passing one of the cards not used along. Please read the comments, and feel free to msg me if you disagree. I still stand by that I was justified in banning him given the info I was provided, and he agreed to that**  Read towards the bottom for the good news..... I always tend to give the bad first.  I would say that 99% of the folks here that post in need, are actually in need. However we all know that some are going to take advantage.   I heard from two redditors that were buying giftcards via CashStar. It turns out that one redditor has been posting a lot here, and got $100 in cards in two days.   I called CashStar, and while I knew they would not release the name, they did confirm the email, and that this person used different names during all the times involved.  To break it down, the same email address got 100 US dollars in gift cards from 4 different posts, yet used different "real" names to acquire a pizza.  I respect reddit rules, and will not post the email address, but his reddit name is AustinYQM . I have confirmed this information, and wanted to be sure before I posted this. Any questions about this please pm me.  CashStar even asked a few redditors if they were from Random Acts Of Pizza, and they support our cause!  This also tells us that CashStar has our back!!!! They noticed when someone was getting repeats, and said something!!! I told her to keep up the good work!!! She will be looking in here tonight, and loves what we have going on!!!   **On to good news:** The manager at CashStar said they have checked out our site, love it! They also said that a way to do international gift cards is in the works, and told me who to email to hopefully speed it along to help us help others..  After talking to them, and their cooperation, all I can say is CashStar Is awesome, and they will be here later tonight to look more into the site!!!! 	True

t3_hv3vp	1307580769.0	veterinarygopher	shroom	[REQUEST] Today ended with a bathtub filled with rusty looking water. 	So a fellow redditor kept me company last night when I was stricken with stress induced insomnia. I never made it to sleep and had to be at work at 7:30. Spent 2 hours this afternoon in the Department of Social Services office trying to see if I qualified for any assistance. Tomorrow I will go on the 30 day processing list for SNAP, they accepted a medicaid application for me and my daughter, and put me on the 2 year waiting list for daycare assistance. I picked her up from daycare and brought her home to give her a bath and as we were filling up the tub I noticed it looked dirty. Then it looked really dirty and red. I stopped the water and got her out of the tub and checked all of our faucets. All had icky brownish red water coming out of them. Needless to say, I'm not cooking tonight and am waiting for the utility company to call me back.

But before he could somebody stole the money out of our SGR's room.  And now everybody is pissed and accusing the SGR of stealing our money which I don't think he did and everything is total shit.  I feel bad because it was my idea and because I've been defending the SGR they think I'm in on it too.      I know this is a big unlikely request.

t3_hudet	1307508998.0	azzip_oAR	pizza	[Offer] Grad Student, poor-ish but I'd like to buy someone a pizza, maybe a couple/husband-wife/parents of young kids.	Basically, I'm a nerdy american engineering grad student, doing research, trying to change the world, etc. I'm making a bit of money but my parents are doing well enough now that they help cover some of my rent/food.   The reason I'd like to buy someone a pizza and why I have a preference about who it goes to (not that I mean to judge about who is "deserving") is that I'd like to help someone do what my parents do for me. I've tried to pay them back for things but they just insist I use it to treat myself to things, to enjoy school. So instead, I'd like to spend a bit of my paycheck on someone else's parents.   That failing, I'd be really happy to give it to a young couple who is struggling maybe. Here I have to admit that I have a bit of a different motive. The other reason I have a bit of money to spend on someone else's food is that I had some plans for it. I had been saving a bit of cash to do something nice for a certain someone but she's gone now so I figure, buying dinner for another young couple...to the universe at least, it's all the same no?   And yes, I did create a reddit account just for this purpose. I've never had one before, always just lurked (yes I'm a bit anti-social even on the internet), but this seemed as good a reason as I'll get to make one.   Ninja edit: I realize it's probably a bit late for ordering pizza for a lot of people but maybe if you'd like one for tomorrow we can arrange that? I'll be going to sleep by 11:30pm Pacific Time because I have to be up super early so working out something for tomorrow makes a lot of sense anyway since I have no idea how quickly people will respond to this.  Morning edit: apologies to everyone for not responding last night. I got called back into the lab and fell asleep at my desk. The offer stands! Thanks to anarchocap for following up on fuzzyslippers33 while I was asleep!	True
t3_huakt	1307501371.0	jaydedrag0n	shroom	[Request] I really could use something to eat	I've pretty much got nothing to eat in the house. My [freezer](http://i.imgur.com/AQdGU.jpg), my [fridge](http://i.imgur.com/GuPTU.jpg), and the lovely [contents](http://i.imgur.com/6Riuk.jpg) of my pantry. Its 7:47pm and I'm in Bakersfield, is there anything anyone can do to assist me for the night?      If I posted too late, well oh well refried beans it is! Thanks for being here RAoP :-)      EDIT: Thanks everyone for trying, it looks like bakersfield just sucks for this. No place will do it without seeing the CC, and the only place with gift cards (ie dominoes) can't accept them in Bako because their system is not set up for them (not even online)      EDIT2: I GOT IT.. or at least i'm GETTING it.. thanks to rollout making a call and ooppee for the lovely ecard... I  will be omw in 15 mins to get my pizza!!! Pics to follow!!! SERIOUSLY THANK YOU      EDIT3: SO! I have my newly awesome [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/QsrQU.jpg)  with my horribly childlike attempt at the [reddit alien](http://i.imgur.com/ZoAG4.jpg)  and why yes that is my kitty in the background giving her thanks too :-)	True
t3_hu9il	1307498839.0	ReverendDS	pizza	[Request] Something to eat for my wife and I.	I know that there is a lot of bad in the world (countered by the awesome that is physically represented here), so my problems don't really seem /that/ bad in comparison to say Ethiopia.  But, we're beyond broke right now. I've been unemployed since September; only making little bits of money, here and there, by doing custom armor pieces. She does have a job, but everything she's making is going to our rent and essential bills (internet, unfortunately, didn't make the cut so I'll be dropping offline in a few weeks).  We have an empty fridge and empty cupboards right now and haven't eaten since Saturday when we shared our last MRE.  We've applied for Food Stamps, but the process is long and slow, so we won't get a decision for another few weeks on that.  We would both be extremely grateful if anyone out there could help us out tonight.  Ninja Edit: We're located in Oxnard/Ventura, CA, US  **Additional Edit**: We have received a pizza. Thank you, CayucosKid for the dinner and thank you to the rest of reddit for being awesome.  PICS!: http://imgur.com/3bGk7  http://imgur.com/o6aG4  Sorry, couldn't get both of us in the photo as someone needed to hold the camera and take the picture before the battery died. :P	True
t3_hu96t	1307498041.0	mordea	shroom	[REQUEST] Very little to eat for a while--could use pizza!	I work from home with my three kids in northwest PA and we only have a couple boxes of cereal with no milk until Monday. Some warm pizza would do wonders for their spirits.  *Thank you, jeaguilar!	True
t3_hu634	1307490221.0	crayzieman	shroom	My pizza story.	This is not a tale of overcoming hardship and adversity or of unemployment and sorrow. No, this is a tale of one mans stupidity and another mans willingness to forgo that and offer a helping pizza. Did I really "need" this pizza in the sense of would I be able to survive without it? Perhaps not, but it probably did save me a few years on my life. Interested? Well, here's the story:  A week and a half ago on Friday I got paid (yes I have a job, no it's not a very good one) and as I normally do when I get paid, I restock. On this particular day I still had some food at home so instead of restocking on that I did the smart thing and bought a bunch of [beer!](http://i.imgur.com/7bco3.jpg) Now, I'm not a heavy drinker, so a bunch of beer to me is a case worth that would probably last me a month or more usually.  I still haven't paid my rent at this point, but I still have plenty to cover it and get by until next paycheck. On Tuesday I pay my rent and everything is good until I remember that this is the month that I need to renew my plates and drivers license! Stupid me, how could I forget, and now I really need to start worrying.  I get my [plates](http://i.imgur.com/MC5UK.jpg) and my license renewed and it ends up costing more than I expected. Not only that but I still need to put gas in my car and pay for the internets. I did what I could to make what little food I had stretch but by the weekend I was pretty much down to nothing but potatoes and beer. For the last 3 days or so that's [all I've been eating.](http://i.imgur.com/d7P8u.jpg)  Then I came across this subreddit in a post that made it to the front page. As I read the posts I realized people had much worse tales than me. I started to feel bad about even thinking of posting a request at all. Then I stumbled across a post made by someone coat tailing an offer thread. His post almost [seemed to be speaking to me directly](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/hth7t/offerpizza_pizza/c1y8r9s) so I took a chance and pmed him the tl;dr of what was going on with me. He must have found it to be a worthy cause because he went ahead and sent me one of the gift cards.  So big thanks go out to [flamingcow](http://www.reddit.com/user/flamingcow) and reddit for saving my liver from further unnecessary stress. My stomach also thanks them because eating potatoes for 3 straight days really does a number on your inner workings. I will definitely be paying it forward very soon. Many upboats will be sailing your way soon Mr. Cow. You definitely went above and beyond.  For anyone interested [heres the pizza.](http://i.imgur.com/aszvC.jpg) It is an italian sausage, parmesan asiago cheese and jalapeno pepper pizza. It is absolutely delicious and to prove it here is a picture of me [enjoying said pizza.](http://i.imgur.com/iMaI7.jpg)	True
t3_hu5nk	1307489133.0	Jeklah	shroom	Thank you Palanski! Also this subreddit is absolutely amazing...	Thank you so much! I made a random post in someone elses thread last night saying I am a poor student, very late for my time, just on the off chance someone might reply (I doubted it, being new to reddit and a lurker so no one would reconise me...) but this kind person whispered me sayin to send my address and he would have one delivered today!  Heres a picture. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v256/Shittie/049.jpg  It was buy one get one free so an extra pizza! I'm stunned, at a loss for words...   Never seen anything like this on an internet forum, this sub reddit is amazing! I would have never thought to see something like this on an internet community lol...complete strangers buying pizza for people at times of need, even going to some great lengths to make it happen sometimes. Fantastic. Well done guys! Thank you again Palanski!	True
t3_hu4ez	1307486203.0	willyo	shroom	This subreddit is proof Oprah has nothing on Reddit!	This subreddit is living proof Oprah has nothing on Reddit!  If the world was filled with the people in this /r/, the world would be a much better, generosity filled, [trusting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JBQPCHHK0Q) place.   A special shoutout to [jake-the-dog](http://www.reddit.com/user/jake-the-dog) for gifting me a pizza hut gift card! He also offered help to many other people. That was just so fricken awesome to do that for a complete stranger! :')  Thanks everyone!	True
t3_hu2vl	1307482539.0	alienzx	pizza	[OFFER] Pizza/food to those who are in real need and hungry. I will give as much as I can afford.	Due to religious restrictions, I cannot purchase meat or meat products. I will only be able to offer delicious veggie goodness or awesome cheesy pies!  (preferably US/Canada users, but can figure out a way to help you elsewhere too)  EDIT: Hey guys, I am all tapped out for now. Please PM me if you are really desperate and missed out. I will see what I can do.	True
t3_htgwx	1307421235.0	ginandtunic	FAP	[OFFER] - A pizza to the first person that has a genuine need for a hot meal.	One of my favorite things to do is help people less fortunate than I am.  I had a very poor upbringing but made the best with what I was handed in life and make a good living now.  I was helped out by very generous people growing up (people who donate time/money/clothes/gifts, etc to foster care are the best people on the planet, IMHO) so now I want to give back as much as possible.  EDIT: Due to the overwhelming response to this the offer stands for more than just "the first person". I've already sent one gift card to Dominos and plan on sending a few more pizzas out today. And a big thank you to anyone saying I'm awesome...I'm not awesome, just a human helping humans, hopefully this catches on and together we can feed and help people in need.   EDIT 2: 3 pizzas have been given out. More to come. Dominos thinks someone stole my card and is buying pizza for people! :) they're making me call and verify now so it may take awhile at this point. I'm in the process of moving so I'm doing this all from my phone. Also, if anyone is in the San Diego area and needs (or knows anyone that needs) any food let me know as we're getting rid of all my pantry food and I'd rather donate it than throw it away. 	True
t3_ht761	1307397460.0	Sparklepuff	shroom	[Request] Broke from having to move, would love to have something other than ramen!	This is my first time posting here, I think this is a really cool idea. If someone gets me a pizza I will definitely pay it forward when I get on my feet.  Forgot to add, my general location is western Ky. Can also provide pictures of cats if desired. If anyone wants to know anything else feel free to ask!  **Thank You to biscuitworld!** [Here's some pictures of some cats.](http://imgur.com/a/P9bmW)	True
t3_hl0ft	1306447574.0	flinteastwood	shroom	[REQUEST] I don't want to ask for my dad's help anymore, even if that means I don't have anything to eat. 	My dad has helped me out of so many binds that it's not even funny, so when my car broke down I decided it was time for me to try to handle things on my own. At first it was the inner and outer tie rod, then I had a problem with the fan switch, and now it won't even start. I was trying to do things on my own so my dad would be proud of me for fixing things but I've just managed to screw it all up.   To make a long story short, I have a full tank of gas and I've spent $650 in two weeks trying to get my car running, but it isn't working. I just bought a bus pass to get to work, so I have $3 to my name until Wednesday rolls around, and an empty pantry to keep me company. If a kind stranger was to provide me with a pie, I'll be more than happy to pay back the hungry with my next paycheck.   EDIT: I'm in Columbus, OH  EDIT 2: The pizza arrived! Thanks raavyn! [It was delicious!](http://www.imgur.com/Lkwsk.jpg) Thank you so much! Look forward to helping someone else out!	True
t3_hkep6	1306386194.0	PocYo	shroom	[OFFER] If your story checks in with me I'll cover you.[/passing forward]	So, I'm a huge fan of this sub reddit and an even bigger fan since it exists. If your story reaches out to me, I'll be more than happy to be an RAOP contributor.  EDIT: Sending Pizza to hungry students @ my alma matter.	True
t3_hj1hr	1306257821.0	raNraNs	shroom	[REQUEST] just one more day! need help waiting it out	Hey guys, I've been living off of protein shakes and cereal these past few days because I can't really afford to buy anything yet, and I've just about run out of anything. The few leftover dollars I did have went towards food for my gerbils. If anyone could help me out with some food for tonight that would be great. I just have to wait one more day and I'll have some income coming in, I'll be able to help anyone in need tomorrow :] edit: Pizza is on the way, thanks to you.	True
t3_hihn4	1306198185.0	rosne	shroom	Starving art student	I was recently let go from my job and despite my best efforts I haven't been able to get one yet. Countless interviews have left me still poor and still starving. If someone could feed me tonight I would really appreciate it and once I have a job I will definitely pay it forward. Thanks!  Edit: I've been fed! Thank you thank you!	True
t3_hecc7	1305739466.0	seanpadraic	PIF	[Request] I will be eternally grateful if someone bought me a pizza and promise to pay it forward when I can.	I just graduated and realized I have no job and and $35000 in student loans. I haven't even been able to celebrate my graduation much at all because I don't have money.  A free pizza would really make me feel better about my situation in general, at least for a little while.  I know there are a lot of people in more need than me and I want to leave this subreddit better off than I found it. So, I definitely plan on buying pizza for random redditors in need once I have a job.  Forgot to mention: It's my last 48 hours in NYC before I move upstate.  **Edit:**   The good news: A very kind person who wished to remain anonymous sent me a $20 e-gift card to Pizza Hut!  The bad news: Even though I live in New York freakin' City, there is no pizza hut close enough that delivers to me! And I don't have a car. So, as of right now, I am unable to use it.  The second good news: I am moving soon. So, I will either use this in the near future or I will just pass it on to some other individual in need!  So, thank you RAOP! I am pretty happy right now, even though I am not eating pizza at the moment!	True
t3_hc44o	1305500495.0	BostonTentacleParty	pizza	Feed starving social science majors?	~~Well, not starving, actually. We could make lentil soup for the 100th time or so. But we're both pretty sick of that, and should be studying for our finals tomorrow. A trip to the store isn't feasible, and we're too poor to justify ordering food--at least until I can find a job again. Once that happens, maybe I, too, can send a pizza to someone in need.~~  Pizza is cancelled. Lentil soup strikes again.	True
t3_h7kjh	1304971834.0	Rollout	Rollout	Some suggestions, and tips for giving/receiving pizza on RAOP.	I am linking this to the sidebar, as a growing list of tips, suggestions, etc... Any suggestions you have please comment, and we can talk about them.  A while back a redditor in the UK sent my wife and I a pizza. We could use it at the time, and it was a good test for him, he wanted to see how hard it was. We ran into a few issues. To avoid those here are a few suggestions.   I personally would recommend smaller pizzerias, helping out the small business is a good idea, plus generally you get better quality. Most smaller pizzerias will not have a problem in taking your credit card payment, and delivering it to a local.   Large chains, such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa Murphy's, etc, require seeing the card holder with the card at the place of delivery. This is one of the issues that we ran into. The easiest way (and in my finding the only way) to avoid this issue is not to mention anything about it. Order the pizza online, or as if you were the one at the delivery site. Most delivery people (although required to) do not ask to see the card. If by chance they do require it you may have an issue.   Some further suggestions:  Feel free to post if you have need, or want to buy a pizza for someone. Please use [REQUEST] or [OFFER] in your title, this makes it much easier.  If you receive a pizza please take a moment from your enjoyment to share with the rest of us, and thank the person who bought it for you.   Please do not be a frequent need poster, while we do know that some people have situations where they need months of help there are a lot of people who could use the up once in a while. Lets spread the help, and love.   We would rather see this community thrive, and sorta police itself as to scams and such, if we need to we will go with a redditgifts type website, but would rather not have to.   Lets spread word of this community on Reddit!!!!   Lets all have fun, and possibly some global pizza party days ?   As I said this will be edited with more suggestions as they arise.   Edit : It has been suggested that people who requested pizza post a general geographic location. I will update the sidebar with this.  I do know it is possible, and not that hard to buy pizza for someone in another country. If you need tips on this please read above.	True
