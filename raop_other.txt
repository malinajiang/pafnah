I've had to buy my bus pass so I don't miss college and all. Was wondering if anyone could help me out tomorrow with a pizza. The one in town is dominos. USA California  	1473873850.0
t3_4u5kgz	1469229322.0	JoshNeedsALife	pizza-gold	Offering Dominos	Hi everyone. I'm offering a large pepperoni or whatever (one topping) pizza and a 2 liter beverage of your choice from Domino's.  It's *nearly* first come, first served- however I only want to buy for people that need it (Broke and no food, really rough week, etc) rather than just want it. I know I have no way to verify that, so please be cool. Due to rules on this subreddit, I won't be considering to any requests through PMs. Only posts here please. Final guideline, this is only for folks in the US.  I'm also a big fan of the email verification tool, http://rikbrown.co.uk/rop, so let's use that too please! Have a great day everyone, I wish you the very best!  -Josh  Also, if you have an email with a variation of the name "Arthur Ciara" you tried to scam me once, and I just saw a picture of imgur of you trying to scam someone else (after you apologized to me). You are a bag of dicks that makes it hard to do nice things for people who need it. I seriously hope your life becomes just a little more difficult than it already is. No, I don't want you to die in a fire, but having your car break down when you really need to go somewhere, or getting really sick before traveling would be about perfect.  Edit: it's been grabbed. I hope everyone has a good whatever time of day it is where you are. 	1469238439.0

Til then my boyfriend and I are basically living on scraps; he's trying to hunt down work but our town is being stingy. We've exhausted all the food banks and favors possible; could really use a pizza.    Edit: a kind soul has got us pizza! Thank you, and thanks all for reading :) 	1453393124.0

PM your email for $10 Papa Johns. The answer was [4449](http://imgur.com/DyXzDly)  I did another contest where people had to submit dancing but it proved to be a little hard. So this one is easier!  Guess the number between 1-5000. Up to 3 guesses so put them in the same comment!  At 10:00pm PDT, I will take a screenshot of the number I chose now w/ the time and date showing of like 30 min ago  Good luck!  edit: tie breaker will be username by alphabetical order starting with A	1453180437.0

I can't keep existing & not living. It's pretty bad. But I'm not here to make ppl feel bad for me. I know pizza won't correct my issues at all, but food will be one less thing I have to worry about. It would be really appreciated. Also if no one wants to get me food, a PM just to chat would be welcome. Im pretty lonely. I promise not to be depressing. I just need a friend. Ok I'm going to stop now. I sound desperate. 	
t3_41a42u	1452976226.0	babylina		Ex bfs dad passed away, his mom is dying. We've spent every last penny on arrangements.	Mt ex's father passed away about a month ago. His mom is a recovering addict who is relapsing after losing her partner of over 30 years. My ex has sold everything he owns in order to cover funeral costs, even the guitar that his father taught him how to play.   He's kind of shut down since then - not showering or getting out of bed for days unless he's working. I've taken it upon myself to stop by his house every day to cook, clean and make sure he's taken care of while he takes care of his two little sisters who have lost their dad and will lose their mom pretty soon.   We just need a break. Cooking for four when we both only make so much money has us eating rice and potatoes most days, and I know the girls could use a break from my four meals. Thanks.   Edit: if I get an offer, there is a local spot down the street who has taken good care of us, if anything it'd be awesome to patronize them, but anything at all is really appreciated. Thanks again.

Rent went (way) up, but no sob story here, I took a second job working the door at a local bar. Not sure when I get paid for that, and the client doesn't pay til she gets back on the 22nd.  $2 in my bank account right now. I'll have some money in the future, I just don't know when. Tough not to feel like an unsuccessful piece of crap when you can't afford groceries, haha.

However, I always work to ensure my son and husband have amazing birthdays complete with dinner, cake, presents. The works!  We have fallen on hard times, I am the only one working, and I lost some holiday pay due to an illness/absence. This has lead to our family skirting by on literally nothing. (Last night's dinner was white rice and a package of the Banquet boneless pork ribs.....yum?)  Much appreciate! I will pay it forward this Friday right here in RAOP, and verify once I've done that, too!  Edit: I forgot to tag the title of the post :/ FAIL.  	1452734362.0

t3_3zbw0k	1451860941.0	jayezzy		Had to cremate my dog today. Can I get some sympathy pizza? (east tn)	My sister left the gate open when she left my house yesterday, and my dog tater tot got loose and was hit by a car.  I got her to the emergency vet, but it was too late she had too much internal bleeding and I had to let her cross the rainbow bridge. I made sure she knew she was a good dog, and tried to comfort her as much as I could.  She came from the pound, and from the second I put a leash on her she never stopped smiling or loving.  She laid in my bed all day, when I pulled into the drive way I could see her keeping watch out the window.  When I bought her home from the vet last night, her window was empty.  No one ran through the kitchen to greet me. This afternoon, I had to drop my buddy at the crematorium.   Its been a tough couple days after a rough end to 2015.  I'm pretty wiped out after vet bills, and I really couldnt afford the cremation.  I just wasnt ready to let her go.  Anyway, if you care to help out I'll be eternally grateful.  If not, no hard feelings.  Either way, thanks for letting me share a little bit about my friend Tater Tot.  Gone but not forgotten.  Love you, pal.

t3_3yg980	1451257958.0	Jsevrior		(Request) Might as well give it a try	So I tried this a couple weeks ago here but met with failure. On the other hand, things are rather more interesting this time. Briefly, I am a completely blind backpacker, The first as far as I know, doing advocacy projects and attempting to instigate educational reforms and have been travelling across North America for about a year and a half. I'm currently booked in a hostel until the end of the month, in order to take a break from movement. Of course, booking the hostel was expensive and I've run out of finances and food. Normally this isn't a problem. I'll find an option. But I'm also in Halifax which is currently getting hit with a snowstorm. Everything is closed, and the things that aren't closed are halfway across the city that is shutting down for the onset of winter. I'm sure I can find a way to survive regardless, but… Pizza would last me for a couple days until I have my train to move west. It would be quite phenomenal if someone could help out with this. I will of course return the favour to someone else within the next couple weeks. Thanks for reading and here's to hoping that this time it works. :)  Also cross posted this to the other subredit. I'm not really sure what the difference between the two is…

t3_3xdqgo	1450467499.0	Jsevrior		request - blind backpacker in winter	Hi all. I'll keep this brief if I can. I just posted my introductions in a couple different subredits explaining who I am and what I'm doing. In summary though, I am to the best of my knowledge the first completely blind person to ever backpack the world independently. I've been travelling for about a year and a half, and as I do so I am running advocacy Projects in each city in order to provide educational reforms for blind children, so that one day they may also have the ability and the skills to travel independently wherever they wish. I generally work with local municipal councils and organisations as well as directly with the blind children. Unfortunately the majority of the disabled community does not have the ability or the education to travel as a backpacker, and so it is my job to change this and to provide the resources so that others can do as I am if they so choose.   Recently I have been doing a fair bit of work in Canada, and have been in Halifax for about two months. Circumstances meant that I got stranded here in the winter. I'm flying to Paris in January, and have rented out a hostel room for the month. Generally, I travel through the use of something called Couchsurfing. However, a TV programme wished to conduct an interview with me, and as a result I have been here too long, and Can no longer rely upon that community in order to have a place to stay. It took the majority of my money to cover the hostel and flight. I had enough leftover to provide myself with nonperishable stores of food for the month, and still have access to this. On the other hand, bread cheese and peanut butter gets old after about three weeks, and a bit of variety would be nice if the option is there. I of course intend to pay this forward, and will be contributing to this community regardless once I have the funds to do so again. I very much like the idea of this subredit, and I'm curious to find out whether or not it is functional.   I'll post a link to both a blog that I started about a year ago, though admittedly it died due to lack of readers, and to my Couchsurfing profile to provide voracity to my story. I'll be very curious to see if this post receives any attention. Tank for reading and thank you for being involved in this community. It affirms one's faith in people, I think.

I appreciate the upvotes and all. **  Hey there, this years been a bit of a crazy one - job, no job, new job then injury.. safe to say my lack of planning or steady income has been a bit of a bummer. I tore my Achilles about 3 weeks ago now. Funnily fell on the last day of training for my new gig. I'm down to my last 50 dollars until I can get back to work (3-4weeks) and I still need to try and get some Christmas presents for the family. I don't have any  food here, or the extra money to order delivery. My car is in the shop and the nearest bus stop is a mile - and on crutches that seems like a marathon. You would really be helping me out with a pie today! I want to be able to pass the gesture on as well. Being unable to do a lot lately has changed my perspective on a lot of things.. The biggest one is being grateful for the little things.   Sorry for the ramble, it's been a long few weeks post-op.   I live in Austin, Tx if that helps.   Thanks for reading. 	1449879110.0

So my girlfriend and I are getting caught up on bills and we've hit a dry spot financially because I just switched jobs and when we're already living paycheck to paycheck that switch means there's a short period of time where you don't get money. So we just paid all our bills so we can continue living here and now we have no money, and no food in our fridge/freezer until the 4th when we get paid again.  I have never requested anything like this before, nor do I like to, but we are so hungry right now it's unreal. Is there anyway we can get help with some food for at least tonight so tomorrow is all we have to worry about before payday? I'd appreciate it so much. You can PM me about it if you need to. Like I said I've never done this before and don't really know how to go about it.  Thank you in advance.

Long story short, I got sued for some medical bills I incurred when I fell off a ladder and broke my arm. I don't qualify for Medicaid, and pay $70 a month for insurance with a $6,500 deductible. Adding everything up, I'm 24 years old and about $25,000 in debt. Now, I'm making payments on everything, I have a job, a house, a car, etc. I'm making it....I'm scraping by, but I'm making it. However, one of the dozens of bills slipped through the cracks, went to court, and I got served. Yesterday, in the check out line at Super Saver, I found out they drained my account...Every. Cent.  Over $600 all at once. A large pizza would easily last me until Friday when I get paid. I'm just hoping someone is kind enough to help me out. Last time, someone messaged me and said they could help out, dragged it out for 2 days, and then I never got pizza. I'm hoping this time has a better outcome. Much Love, either way.

I am being fined for being locked out after hours (I live at the dorms) and not cleaning my part of the common areas "satisfactorily" this week. My laptop is also in the process of dying (like it thought I had 300mb of ram, I think something has corrupted).  I'm Australian, and Dominos is the only place that delivers to where I live.

Kind of an update of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/3pu9z7/coming_off_of_a_really_intense_diet_could_use/)  effectively me and my GF donated food and spent months food budget on protein, detoxes, and other supplements which are the only thing we eat.  It turns out despite thinking you're getting everything you need in a days worth of food that's super unhealthy.  This has to stop, literally everyone has advised against it, today was supposed to be the day it stopped and we ate again but when I woke bae up and told her we really needed to eat real food she wasn't having any part of it.  She thinks if we start eating again we'll get addicted to regular food.  I need to figure out some way to get food she likes in front of her.  If someone could help us take the first step out of this bind I'll pay it forward and not do anything so stupid ever again.  I'm not paid until the 5th but I always hold up my end of a deal.  We just desperately need a pizza and a salad.  It's at the point my stomach is twisting and I'm listening to [Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt1Pwfnh5pc) drinking this stuff with the same face [Dumbledore made drinking the potion of despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nVQPwH2m4s)

t3_3pu9z7	1445558092.0	jmillerworks		Coming off of a really intense diet, could use pizza to reward self	Today a neighbor came by and told me he and some other neighbors collected canned foods for us.  That's when I knew we need to stop dieting as hard as we have.  To go back to the beginning of this nonsense I need to take you back to the 28th of last month.  Myself having an event the 11th wanted to cut off weight from 1 year of bad eating in a matter of days.  Using a variety of methodologies from bro science and runway fashion models myself and some friends came to the conclusion we could live on a diet consisting primarily on nutritional supplements.  > goals are to minimise and preserve muscle mass through the maintenance of high protein levels while using full body weight training sessions with minimal cardio. The dieter instead takes a daily walk to up their levels of daily activity without resorting to muscle wasting cardio. and to reduce calories to the lowest possible threshold while still eating enough protein to preserve lean tissue mass and enough micronutrients to avoid deficiency This is best  used by someone who wants to shed fat in the shortest possible time.   majority of calories entering your mouth are from protein, but the majority of calories you burn for energy come from fat the goal is to get to ketosis a metabolic state in which the body primarily relies on fat for energy.  you can’t “burn” protein for energy the way you burn fat or carbs. The protein is just there to replenish muscle mass and prevent lean tissue loss – it’s used as building blocks, not as fuel. Instead of burning that protein for fuel, you’ll be burning your own body fat reserves, so you essentially are “eating” fat – your own fat.   Today I learned that's based on real science but it's intended for the morbidly obese.  A protein modified sparing fast for 800 lb people before surgeries.  Not meant for the chubby.  This has been combined with the use of stimulants for intense strength workouts several times a week.  My next scheduled one is 2 hours.  > We started out the 28th of November with 5 protein shakes a day, 1 solid meal a day of raw vegan foods, 400 calories a day across 5 meals and training.  Tips that are going to apply through this regiment is drinking plenty of water, whenever you are hungry drink a liter of water.  Drink a full glass of water before you eat a meal, and sip a full glass in between bites, you'll get full faster.  We go raw vegan because it feels like more with less calories, light and fluffy foods compact in your digestive tract and you'll feel hungry soon after.   Celery has hardly any calories in it (6 calories per stalk) and the process of digesting food burns energy  It's a bulky fiberous plant that takes a lot of chewing and digesting so it burns energy highly recommended.  > The 8th we stopped eating altogether.  Your body is already in a ketogenic fast so you're REALLY taking advantage of the situation, and all that protein loading you did last week.  You're going to consume nothing but cold water, the body burns extra calories heating up ice cold water to 98.6 degrees, water flushes out any toxins that build up in the body.  You're going to increase the weight you did last week on your workouts and walk about 6000 steps a day.  If you look at the math, one pound of fat is 3,500 calories. If you need to lose 10 pounds that's 35,000 if your body burns 2,000 a day, you burn even 500 at the gym 4 times a week that's 16,000 right there.  I should of stopped here...  > A few days into that you're gonna start hearing voices, that's ok it's part of the process.  It's going to talk bad shit to you 24/7, prove it wrong with your workout and sticking with the program, it's there to make sure you stick with the program.  If you really get those twisting pains to eat look at a fat person you hate, and at a fit person you admire to stay motivated.  You're going to need to be away from people, you might want to get away from the internet as well, that's not the best time to be socializing to be honest.  You're gonna be a bit nuts, we had someone drop off the program there.  I actually had to swear off the internet and most socialization for these days.  Everything just made us angry, we stuck with it, even exercised more but we lost people.    > After 10 days of that that eat more exercize more, thats how you beat the adaptive thermogenesis of starving that long. I'd say on your 10th day you are allowed a lean reasonable solid food meal.  If you eat it you're going to find it doesn't taste as good as it used to because you reset your taste buds which will be important for eating healthy after the program.  Those voices are going to talk mad shit about you too so you won't really want to eat that much. 10,000 steps a day walking, a 2 hour workout hitting every part of the body with proper rest and I eat maybe 500 calories in protein powder and other supplements.  I call it the soylent diet, everything is measured out to give your body the energy it needs for that day and to grow a bit.  no more no less.  If I need a protein boost mid workout that's fine, just keep training hard heavy weights, attack them and eat protein when you're hungry.  This is the only way to decrease the stress on your metabolism while not gaining weight in the process.   That's the state I'm at now.  I randomly wake up at night and go for 8 mile walks.  http://imgur.com/4Uy4te6  I've been hallucinating food scents, last night I swear I smelled barbecue, from my neighbors at 10 pm which is why I went for a walk.  I kept smelling different foods, I walked into a store and had an overwhelming urge to steal a fruit cup with another voice mocking me for being so weak.  One part of me knows I CAN finish the progrom.  But I'm not sure if I should.  We committed by spending this months food money on supplements, protein powders, superfood, vitamins, my girlfriend is on a teatox and eating less than half of what I do.  I don't think this is healthy though, I just realized your body probably needs a lot of shit thats not in these supplements.  I have $6 on paypal and $12 in free grub at grubhub but the pizza place has a $20 delivery minimum.  It really hurts, if anyone can help out it would be highly appreciated.  We both really need to start eating again.

All of them have gone from foster home to foster home due to the abscense of their parents or guardians. They are currently living in a duplex and renting out one of their 4 rooms to help with rent. Their parenrs both work night and day and usually only have each other to talk to or play with during the day. This is the only night both parents have off and being a good family friend of this family, I offered to babysit no charge to let the parents go out for a night. I'm asking for one act of kindness to send to our (undisclosed) adress in Troy, Ohio. These kids have barely any food in their house and I don't have enough money to buy food for even 2 kids. I will pay the act foward once I can earn enough money by donating it to a local charity or to the family in need. Thank you for your time, God Bless.

My name is Jason and I'm from Ypsilanti, MI. This weekend, I hit the perfect storm of B.S. Seasonal flu kept me out of work 3 days last week, and my ridiculous copay drained my money.   Past that, getting my bricked phone swapped, paying utilities, rent, etc yesterday drained most of my check, leaving me $15 until next Friday. Exactly enough for gas if I really only drive to & from work.   To avoid my diet for the week being the half bag of tater tots and 3 packs of ramen I have, I was really hoping someone could hook me up with some pizza so I have something to spread out for a few days, and I'll pay it forward as soon as I can.   In advance, should anyone be so kind, thank you. Even if not, thanks for reading. Even being semi-complainy made me feel a little better.

t3_3m3hcd	1443032347.0	ragecrushdestroy	shroom	I work with idiots. And for idiots.	I work in the programming department of a call center. There are well over 100 employees here at any given time, and there is only one break room. In this break room, there is a fridge. Well, there WAS a fridge. You see, lately, there have been a rash of lunch thefts. Not just mine, but mine has been a pretty common target (one time, they even stole my insulin because I work with some pretty low-down folks and hey! Something in the fridge with a prescription label on it). Several complaints have been made to HR about this and today, they finally took action. While I was helping our IT guy haul around servers, the center director decided that since people keep stealing lunches, nobody deserves to have a fridge right now. So they hauled the fridge into the basement. And threw away the contents of the fridge.    Anyone care to guess what was in that fridge?    If this would have happened to anyone else, it would be hilarious. I get that. But damn, I'm hungry. Anyone mind hooking me up with whatever the hell you want? I'm not picky.

You can see my Reddit history (almost 3 years active) that I'm being honest here. I have been out for about a month now, and been living pretty strictly on the rice, beans, and macaroni. Child support isn't sympathetic to recently released felons, and every penny I earn doing temp labor is going to that.  I just want a hot pizza so bad. I miss it. Two years without pizza must gain some sympathy? :p Thanks..  Humbly, Matt  Edit: I'm in Spokane, WA	1442636791.0

t3_3kbkhs	1441843277.0	Aarondhp24	pizza	Broke at truck driving school in East TN. Today was weird, and I'd love a pizza. Will play music for food, and telling a story in the meantime.	To preface I'll give a bit of history on how I ended up here. I moved back home from California after being stuck there for 6 years. Stuck, how?" You might be wondering.  Well while I was in the military there, I picked up a felony charge. That charge is no longer on my record at all. You can check out my submission history to do some light reading on *that* situation.  I made the decision to come back home shortly afterwards, and got to Tennessee back in April. Work was sporadic. I worked at a pizza shop with my eldest younger brother, as a server. That job fell through pretty quick. The entire staff was teenagers fresh out of highschool, and I come from a fine dining background. 2/10 would not recommend.  So i go to work for a research group investigating timeshare fraud. They were paying part time minimum wage, and I had a deal secured for nearly $25K. At 15% commission, I was going to be set for the months I was behind on bills. Well, my boss man let that deal fall through the cracks and I started getting repot notices from my bank. I borrowed over $1,000 collectively from my parents to hang onto my car and insurance (this was 3 months of bills stacked up).  I've been a /r/vandweller for some time and I really liked the idea of trucking. Saw an add for paid truck driver school with a $200 food stipend. I did my math, and if I left that week I could make it to the company training phase and make $300/wk, then $500/wk minimum for my first 60 days on the road.   I jumped. Big mistake. The stipend was $50/wk for two weeks and then $100 when I graduated. Suffice to say, if you mess up any test or miss any deadlines, you're here longer than the 3 weeks it's supposed to last, and you're just going hungry **or in debt to the school for $6,000.**  Nice little scam they got going here. So now that I'm signed into a contract out of desperation, I've found out what a shit hole this school is. I'm going to go ahead and post this and update with the rest of the story from today:  So I'm attending this joke of a school. Instructors don't instruct. One in particular likes to yell at us like we're not paying them $300 a day for this course. Absolutely unprofessional environment to be obtaining a federally regulated CDL. They gave us a study guide that was created by a woman who has never driven a truck or gotten her CDL before. Saying things like "a gap of 1/4" between the brake lining and the drum" or calling a torsion bar a torque bar. The air brake test was written improperly and if you miss ONE thing on it at the exam, you fail. As you can imagine, most of the students have complained to the recruiting company that sent us here. We've been misled at pretty much every step of this process, and the guys that struggle? They won't pass this course. One girl has been here Mon-Sat 8:00-6:00 for 5 weeks. This is a 3 week course, and I can do every maneuver in my second week. She can't do a single one, and half the time the instructors are up at the rest area on their phones!  Get this: students are banned from teaching other students. Gee, wonder why. I brought a truck sim I got on steam to explain some stuff to the guys having a hard time, and I was told to put it up and play with myself for 7 hours out of the day while we waited to get on the trucks. What a joke.   On to my WEIRD day. So I'm going up to take a potty break during our morning pre trip inspection, and the worst instructor we have, we'll call him Douchebag, pulls me to the side at the door away from everyone. He then proceeds to threaten me, telling me if we weren't at the school he'd beat my ass. I'm 28 years old, paying $300 a day to this school, and he's threatening me for **complaints made by multiple students.**  It was a moment that /r/PublicFreakout would have loved. I managed to get my phone out as his boss was pulling up and his tune changed quick. So I'm thinking "Ok, this guy is about to lose his job." Lol, no. That would be the rational thing to have happen. We wait for the schools admin to get there and sit down with her, douchebags boss, and another instructor that was nearby and witnessed some of it. They suggest that I don't know what a threat looks or sounds like. They try to throw words like "roughhousing" around. One of them tried to accuse me of being aggressive, to which I aggressively retorted "what part of me telling him I'm not gonna fight back, I'm just going to call the police" over and over seemed aggressive while I'm being actively threatened. I'm told this is the nicest person the admin has ever known, and that was about the point I just cut the conversation off. I told them i was calling the sheriff and the recruiting center and tomorrow I'm contacting the actual trucking company to flesh out this nightmare employment process.  If I wasn't on the hook for $6K, I would have walked away already. This is crazy town during a free meth event.   So I talked to the Sheriff, filed a report, douchebag left the school of his own volition before she got there (smart move on his part) , I got to play the good guy telling them "No I don't want him fired because you're already dangerously understaffed. Just keep him away from me." Now I'm sitting on my hotel room with no cell reception, and the internets jumping in and out  so I can't skype call my Mom, and I really really want to :(  That was my day. I have a guitar, and I'm learning "Can't help falling in love" so I figure I would do a video tribute or maybe try to learn an easy song for someone who was interested in getting me some hot delicious pepperoni pizza. Thanks much, and if you made it this far, you deserve a medal for endurance. Thanks for reading.	1441844330.0

t3_3j32g6	1441028948.0	chevybow	shroom	[PSA] Dominos Is Giving away a free pizza today!!!	Didn't see a post on this sub so I thought you guys ought to know. If you participated in previous dominos giveaways then you know the drill. Otherwise, here's the /r/freebies discussion on this giveaway.    https://www.reddit.com/r/freebies/comments/3j1atp/no_hitter_thrown_tonight_free_pizza_on_monday/    I believe all you have to do is create an mlb account BEFORE the promotion and then keep refreshing from about 2:55 eastern time until you see the box to log in (you will have to log back in even if you are logged into the site already. Be sure to type out your password quickly or have it copied and ready to paste).     This is like the 6th one this season. I snagged one pizza and gave out a 50% code last promotion. If you miss the batch of free pizza's which run out quick- you will get the 50% code. Use it up or give it away here! Good luck!

t3_3iuu37	1440864353.0	swiscris		A slice would be nice	So I finished moving into my new place this week when I realized I couldn't find my wallet. After two days of searching I've resigned myself to the fact that it's gone. Unfortunately, when I moved to the U.S.A 6 years ago I was in high school and young and naive, and got myself caught in a craigslist scam. As a result the bank closed my account and made it impossible for me to get an account anywhere for 7 years. So as it stands I have had to run all my finances through PayPal, but having lost my paypal card I have absolutely no way of withdrawing money. My new one is on its way but it's been a few days and Ive run out of food. I'm not usually one to ask for charity but I'm so hungry that the thought of pizza literally bypasses my stomach and is getting me physically aroused.

This week is not only the first week of school and my son goes to a school for kids on the autism spectrum. Because his school is so small I have to send him to school with lunch because it's not provided for same with breakfast like at most public schools.

Now i'm not sure if you ever had to deal with student finance but the money they give does not cover the holidays especially with rent and things.  After spending a couple of hours on the dominos wondershot with the hopes of free pizza, the deals there are the exact same as the normal deals. Then like an RKO out of nowhere, i hear about this wonderful place. A mystical place where pizza can happen, believe me i don't want to ask but can you help me reddit? You're my only hope.  So why should you give me a jobless student this magical act of kindness? Well i have very limited ability with paint, (by limited i mean i've used it once about ten years ago). So if you'd like the most pathetic paint drawing in the history of mankind i can exchange this, otherwise i am open to suggestions. I can also issue a sincere promise that once money has found it's way back into my life, i can help pass this miraculous gift onto others. So if you find me worthy i will be forever in your debt. 	1439157690.0

t3_3fsxnd	1438726965.0	Fastpizza		Been saving all my money over the past couple months.	Right now me and my girlfriend are saving all the money we have to convert a sprinter van into a mobile home to travel in. I'm not poor by any means but we both have cut back on frivolous costs by not eating out, we both stopped smoking pot and cigarettes ( formally heavy smokers) and drinking all together. I don't want anyone to think I'm in need because I'm not, but a pizza would be nice. Especially as an Atlanta magazine just announced a new pizza place half a mile from our house as best pie in Atlanta.  If any of yall are interested in living in a van go check out /vandwelling

We have no food, no internet, no cable tv and I know he is starving. I just had to pay a fine on my car 2 days ago and it drained the last bit of cash we had. If I can get him a pizza I would be willing to "pay it forward" once we have gotten on our feet again.   Thank you for any considerations given. 	1438647545.0

I was out of the country this month, and he was supposed to put some cash I had set aside in my account for a substantial bill I needed to pay. Didn't do that, now I am $200 in the negative with no job.  I will be receiving money from my wonderful family in the next couple days, but in the meantime I have nothing. Please help!

t3_3fj0b1	1438537796.0	Asmoday1232		Surprise for neighbor.	So last night a woman and her 2 kids moved into the apartment next to me. Got to talking and tho she didn't say it directly you could tell she left her husband that day from abuse. I do not have any codes, nor the ability financially this week, to help and my roommate told me about this subreddit. Figured I'd give it a shot I want to do something for them. One act of kindness could mean everything and help settle any fears, if only for one day. I do not wish to ask for hand outs, I never ever do. So my deal for this is, if someone has a code for to help these people out next week when my pay comes through I am willing to full price reimbursement you back what it was. Hush your face about 'it's a free meal' or whatever you wish. It is how I am and will never change haha. Thanks guys/gals for what you are all doing here. Pretty awesome thing and I wish you all good luck.

t3_3f17ja	1438180872.0	ayeooh		The Great Pizza Exchange	What’s up Reddit.  After reading the story of u/SobeyHarker’s quest to make in rain pizza on the good ole US of A, I became inspired to join the fight.  I propose an idea.  Instead of sending a pizza that any Joe Sixpack could pick up himself, I propose we send a pie from your favorite local pizzeria (no national franchise).  Obviously, this present some challenges, but nothing a little ingenuity cant overcome.  Since this idea is still taking shape, I would appreciate some feedback.    * The pizza must be “take and bake”  (uncooked and frozen) * The pizza must be cold packed to endure the journey * The recipient must reciprocate and send a pie from their favorite pizzeria (I know this is kinda again to core purpose of the sub, but I thought an exchange type situation would be cool)

t3_3ecxi3	1437679853.0	lyingsage		Request- BC, Canada - No food in fridge but a day to celebrate!	I'm not in an emergency or anything, so feel free to offer to anyone posting about not eating for a few days.  2 days ago I hit 11 months sober!! And in 7 days will be the one year anniversary of why I started that journey. Almost a year ago, my best friend overdosed and passed away. He was an incredible person I would go over to his city to work during the week. We were both actively using, but by no means junkies. We both have struggled with addiction our entire lives, but maintained being high functioning addicts. I had to come back to my city to pick up methadone. was supposed to come back the next day, but he wouldn't answer his phone. Called a friend after 2 days of frantic calling, who climbed in and found him gone. It hurts just thinking about it. I got a lot of crap for it, as if I did it to him. Unfortunately it took that to open my eyes. And here I am, almost a year later, Sober for the longest I've been since I was 12! Pizza was special to us. Everyday we'd walk/skip arm in arm from his house down to the skytrain station to grab some freshslice pizza. Macaroni and hotdog for him (yuck lol) and whitesauce chicken for me. I cherish those pizza-y memories...    A small freshslice pizza (whitesauce chicken) is 7.50 I believe. nice and cheap.   It will be a bittersweet week this week. Unfortunately I ran out of food yesterday, nothing to eat today, but get paid tomorrow. If anyone could help out with a small pizza if no one else is in line or more desperate. Thanks all, at the very least for letting me tell my story :)	1437681256.0

Black eyes, concussions, and I've got a cracked rib. We're nearly broke after buying our prescriptions and there's no food in house. We are in no shape to go out in public but we have enough cash to cover a tip if some nice soul wanted to send us a pizza. I can pay it back when I get paid 7/10.

t3_3c4lex	1436036056.0	iowabeans		Discontinue requests	It seems like this sub has become more of a soup kitchen for scammers or people who just want free stuff.  If people are so greatly in need there should be another direction we can point them in for help.  I feel the sub would be much better off just allowing giveaways and competitions.  There's nothing 'random' about someone receiving a free pizza for making up a fake sob story about how their parents left for the week and didn't leave food or money.

So I just recently got an IT job through temp to hire employer TekSystems. They were supposed to have direct deposit setup for me weeks ago, but apparently messed that up somehow. I was fine with that for now because they were supposed to give me a paper check yesterday. Well they called yesterday and they said that it is stuck in Tennessee and wouldn't get here until Monday because of the holiday season... I don't have much cash to get me through this weekend. :/  If anyone could help, I would pay it forward once I'm nice and settled in to my job. Been paying off past bills with my last few checks I have received.   Closest locations are Pizza Hut, Jet's Pizza, Butch's Pizza.  Thank you all in advance and have a safe and fun holiday!! :)  Edit: I've never attempted this before.

More than anything else I would like to have food around for the family (parents, sister, brother, me) to pick at and eat as needed since there are sure to be many feels and long talks -- it would just take so much stress off of everyone involved not to have to worry about food.   If you need verification there is a post in my comment history about the circumstances under which he and his fiancée left -- it's an interesting read.   Big three are all near me, very flexible with whatever we can get -- beggars can't be choosers after all! Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this!  North Carolina, USA

t3_32yufc	1429305507.0	Shirkaday		A different way to feed random people...Uber Rush bike messengers	I got bored one day at work, and I kinda enjoy the idea of using iPhone apps to make actual things happen with real people 1500 miles from where I am. It's just fascinating to me.   In NYC, Uber has bike messengers you can request to pick things up and bring them to another place. I had the idea of ordering a sandwich for pickup somewhere in the vicinity of a few messengers, and then send one there to pick it up and instruct them to eat it.   I made the order with Grubhub or Seamless and added in the notes that a courier would pick up the order.  Then I called a messenger to the restaurant. They text you asking what they are picking up, and I responded with, "A turkey sandwich for your lunch. Enjoy!"   It was fun to watch the guy ride from where he was to the restaurant and successfully pick up the sandwich.

Thankfully my car is not totaled but needs a lot of repair before I can drive it again. No one was seriously injured which is a blessing. I’m left with stiff neck, very bad headache (small miracles), seatbelt rash and my mind in a weird place. I would love a pizza since I now can’t drive to the store or to get food. Pizza Hut is the closest to me but I think other places like Papa John’s and Domino's will deliver to my house.

I'm serving as a graduate assistant for an Alternative Spring Break where I'm serving as the campus' supervision for 40 college students while we all do some community service on a wildlife preserve in Florida. I have to leave tomorrow afternoon. Usually a great thing. However, since my professor cancelled class this past Wednesday, he wants us to make up for it by reading 4 medium/long articles and writing a not so long, but long enough to be annoying paper for it due the Friday of Spring Break. He told us this afternoon while I was at work. Since I won't have wifi/laptop while I'm in Florida, or on the 18 hour bus ride from Central Illinois, that leaves me to do it tonight.   I don't have the funds to buy my own pizza because I'm broke, but I just patched things up with my long distance girlfriend (she's in NY) and cooking dinner is just not happening. A medium dominoes would be a godsend right now as I try to get this shit done...

I'm scared. I'm sad. I had a few beers in my fridge (bought when I had a job!) and I drank them super fast, so I'm a little drunk. And now I'm trying to talk myself out of pizza, because that's rich people food.  I have never asked for anything in my life, but I've been crying for hours, completely panicked about how I'm going to pay my bills this month. I have food! Look at all this kale and all these beets! I don't even need pizza! I'm not even sure why I'm asking for it.   If you have money, give it to someone with kids or something first.

t3_2xbvx2	1425020898.0	YaketySnacks		(Request) Real pizza in Tokyo... please!	I am not sure if you know but pizza in Japan is, well, not what I am used to in Canada. Mayo sauce, seaweed flakes, and it's not exactly a cheap food here.  I know a restaurant near my place that serves italian style pizza and I want to go so bad. Things have been tough and I am feeling home sick.  A large pizza can run 30-40 dollars here, though I don't need a large. If someone gets me this pizza it's very generous of them.  If you are around Tokyo we could arrange to eat together. If not I could probably send you a postcard from Japan if you're comfortable giving me that information. Otherwise I could offer a drawing (not an artist, low quality), a short story, or possibly do a small piece of english to japanese translation for you (within reason).  If anyone does end up getting me the pizza I will be so grateful.   Thanks for reading and wishing all the best to all the other hungry people out there.

Just one catch.	willing to donate a pizza or two to someone in need. I'm a college student majoring in sustainable food systems. The biggest challenge is educating people on the problems we face regarding food, so in exchange you have to research and provide one specific negative consequence of the production method of each topping you want on your pizza. Cheese is the bare minimum.   For example, tomatoes use a ridiculous amount of broadleaf herbicide to kill all the greenery around the fruits before they're harvested.  This has resulted in increased cancer rates among migrant workers in California central Valley.   If you just want a cheese pizza, tell me something bad about industrial dairy. If you want mushrooms or peppers or sausage, tell me something bad about how those things are produced conventionally.  Happy Saturday!  Edit: I've given away two Zza's this weekend and I've learned some stuff at the same time. Hopefully you guys continue to wonder about what's really going on behind the closed doors of America's food system. It's not all beautiful packaging and perfect produce.

t3_2utchw	1423095250.0	stowawayhome	shroom	Thank you Bucknakid14 for going above and beyond the normal act of kindness! The saga of their kindness and a bonus cock pic (SFW)	U/Bucknakid14 is the bestest! Even though they had to deal with a scammer or 2, the weird policies of Pizza Hut Hawaii (who won't take gift cards :/), they still made sure that I got the pizza and breadsticks that s/he originally offered over 6 hours ago.   When the pizza folks forgot the breadsticks, s/he even called and made sure they delivered! I got an extra order of breadsticks and was able to share one with my pet rooster, Pillow. SFW cock pic : http://imgur.com/YhdyY9a  Thank you bucknakid14!  Mods... do you have special flair for someone who goes above and beyond? Also... beware of the scammers. Someone PM'ED from a user account that was one letter off of mine. Thankfully the charge was reversed before the scammer got the pizza....	
t3_2uso4o	1423084048.0	andrewdefrank		Trying to surprise boyfriend.. Will paint for pizza!!!	So my boo thang is outside in the cold building me an igloo. It's been about an hour or so and I know he's probably getting tired. Plus, if you've heard anything about Toledo weather, it's been bad (thankfully not as bad as last year).   But anyways, we really don't have anything awesome for me to make for dinner tonight and going out really isn't an option since we're both unemployed, waiting to start our new jobs at the end of this week. Kinda want to surprise him with a hot meal that isn't boxed macaroni or ramen.   If someone blesses us with a pizza right now I can paint you something sweet, I promise.

My partner and I decided to move to the north coast of Ireland, for a life by the sea... and during the transition between work, we've found ourselves in a new apartment in a new town... with no electricity and no heating. Haha.  All I want to do is give her the anniversary dinner we both crave, so deeply.  A delicious pizza.  Help me, my bread loving brethren.  Help me. And I might get the sex.

Went for a run, fell over a broken sidewalk and severely broke my foot. On crutches with boot and splint for six weeks and mandatory bed rest for two weeks.    I'm scared because my unemployment is gone. Rent for the month has been paid, and I have $60 to my name. I am estranged from most of my family, and my friends are trying to pass the hat. I am 33, no kids, clean, sober and feel terrified and like a loser. I'm eating carrots and baby food for dinner until a friend figures out who is going to do a grocery run for me.

t3_2tbtu2	1421960457.0	Franklyidontgivearip	PIF	Oh boy, our daughter is in the hospital again. Can anyone help with a gift card?	I'm not sure where to start.  My little family has found its way in need of a pizza gift again.  In our [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2fpm3e/request_today_is_our_daughters_2_month_birthday/), our daughter was in the hospital on her 2 month birthday.  Ultimately, she was here a week.    She's back in the hospital again, with the same problem.  She's now 6 months old (Proof: http://imgur.com/49xAXxw).  We're here again for the long haul.  We had string cheese this morning around 7 for breakfast and that's all we've had today.  And we're slightly hungry.  We have no cafeteria food vouchers since I'm not breastfeeding anymore, but we have our food stamp card.  The grocery store is a few blocks away.  My husband works about an hour away and we have one car, so we will have to arrange scheduling for one of us to go get a days worth of cold groceries at a time (SNAP doesn't allow you to purchase "hot" food like deli meals or subs.)  We get paid on the 30th of January.  We only have a microwave for cooking while we're here and a limited amount of space since the while floor shares a fridge. I'm sure pizza or wings will help while we're here.  Papa Johns is all that's close by with delivery.    Can anyone help?

I tried to season my wok on the gas stove top, and it kind of went all firey on me... I panicked, and went for the fire extinguisher in the cupboard, and knocked the gas fitting a bit, and caused a leak.  I was able to quickly turn it off, but now, I got nothing to cook on, and the fiancée gets like a grumpy toddler when she's hungry (I know, it's sad, but I still love her).  I live outside of Melbourne Australia in a small town.  I'm a sad, sad, person. But getting pizza would remove one or both (hopefully both) of those sads.

Come home, get my daughter up, get her ready to head off to school...  Only when the time came to get everyone breakfast, I opened the fridge...only to find it warm.  My daughter had a can of chicken noodle soup for breakfast, but without the stuff in our fridge we don't have much of anything for food, and Lowes said they "might be able to sneak us in tomorrow afternoon, maybe" because of a cancellation.  Anyone out there nice enough to slip food for us and the kids our way? We'd be deeply thankful :).

t3_2shhga	1421297712.0	Ryanthelarge		For the love of God, please help a diabetic out! [US]	Ok, so I'm a type 1 diabetic. Have been for 21 years. My wife is a nutritionist/dietician/personal trainer. Pizza happens to be really bad for diabetics, and in a cruel twist of fate, I happen to love pizza. She's going out of town this weekend to visit a friend. And like a dumbass, I mentioned I was gonna order a pizza. S$he didn't like that (she sounds controlling, but it's for my health and in my best interest). So, she set alerts on our banks accounts for any purchases through any pizza place. If I order a pizza and use cash, she'll know - I'll have to go to an atm to pull out the cash and she'll see it. I'm seriously regretting my decision to mention I was going to buy a pizza. Can someone help me out and send a pizza my way Friday night?

t3_2rrrse	1420744230.0	BIGMc_LARGEHUGE	FAP	Bad day yesterday due to an emergency vet visit. Long day today. Hopefully someone can make it a little better	So yesterday I had to take an unpaid day off from work to handle a court situation only to be told 3 hrs before hand that it had to be rescheduled because one of the officers couldn't show up(I'm facing a charge for weed possession)   So a little bit later I went to the store onky to be called in a panic by my roommate telling me that my dog was able to reach,  and eat,  the whole tray of dark chocolate brownies she made. So I had to go back home and rush him to the vet. They gave him hydrogen peroxide to induce vomiting,  which didn't work. So then they gave him morphine and ran him around to induce vomiting, which also didn't work. So the only thing left was to give him a catheter, IV fluids and doses of charcoal to help absorb the toxicity of the chocolate. It was a very long day at the vet followed by a very long night of me observing him to make sure he didn't have diarrhea/vomit/die. This whole ordeal cost $240, which was all but $5 of what I had till pay day next week.   Then today I left for work and remembered a little bit ago I never took anything out to defrost for dinner. So I'm hoping someone would wanna hook me up with some papa Johns tonight. I'm not in dire straits, I have soup and tuna at the house I could throw together, but I'm hoping one of yall can hook it up with some pizza so I could just go home and collapse into the couch with my dog. I can either pay you back or pay it forward next week when I get paid.   I don't have a pic of the vet bill on me right this moment(still at work) but I can provide a few pics yesterday of my dog in the crate at the vet where you can see his shaved leg from the catheter insertion. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope everyone has an awesome day.   http://imgur.com/a/L73LI

I live in SoFla, area code 33015, closest place to me being a Pizza Hut, but any chain is fine. Thanks for the consideration	1417211589.0

Submit a joke and this Sunday night on or about 8PM Hawaiian Standard Time I'll pick the funniest entrant for a $20 gift card to you name it pizza place.	**Details**  HST is UTC - 10 hours  All you need to do to enter is submit a joke.  Jokes may be mundane, culturally smart, crude, politically incorrect, whatever...if you look at my posting history I love all kinds of jokes from stupid to smart to crude to whatever.  In mind with the above statement I usually read super popular joke threads, so while you are welcome to recycle a joke from elsewhere on reddit, if you do it's likely I've heard it before, which diminishes your chances. I'm hoping to hear a funny new joke I haven't heard before.  To gauge my sense of humor with a gun to my head my favorite jokes would maybe be:  - "edgy" *Why did the Heaven's Gate Cult commit suicide? They were just trying to keep up with the Joneses...I'd tell a Jonestown joke as well but I don't think you'd like that punch line.*  - "stupid" *How do you shoe a horse? You wave your arms madly and yell, 'Shew horesey, shew, get outta here, scram!"*  Really I love all jokes.   **All may play...if the big three aren't in your area (or you're non-US, whatever) we'll work something out.**  Make me laugh.  **EDIT: The contest is now closed, and the winner has been notified by PM. I will post the winner here once they have claimed their prize IAW the sub's recommendations.**	1416221180.0

I'd like to get a pizza or two for her so she doesn't have to cook today. Its just bad swelling and should swell back to normal in a few hours.  And to maybe boost the chance for a hot pie, [here is a picture of our doggie](http://i.imgur.com/wSYdNRL.jpg) and sorry for hazy quality.  **EDIT**:bad spelling :p  **EDIT#2**: Forgot to say we live in SC and its 5 of us together.	1413908030.0
t3_2jv1n0	1413868350.0	honeyket		Car got broken into on our anniversary, wallet stolen, engagement ring stolen, had to cancel dinner plans, very hungry and upset	It's the night of me and my boyfriends dating anniversary, and we're staying at a really nice hotel. We were getting ready to go out to a really nice restaurant when he told me he forgot something in the car, I get a phone call minutes later saying his window was shattered and his car was broken into. He had left his wallet in the car with all his IDs and credit/debit cards. We just spent 2 hours dealing with hotel security and police reports and canceling credit cards during the police reports he had to come out and say he had a very expensive ring in his car and later on he told me it was my engagement ring :( we of course had to cancel our restaurant reservation so now we're stuck in a hotel room and we're both really hungry. We're both redditors and we both got the idea to post here, maybe you guys can make this night a little better :(	
t3_2jumb4	1413858323.0	Clasi		It's 7 pm and I don't have anything for dinner	I have spent the last 3 hours arguing with my husband. He spent the last of our money, and we now don't have anything to go to the grocery store with. Everything that I could make for dinner is frozen, because I've spent the last few hours fighting and crying.  I could really use a pizza tonight. It's been a long hard night, and we're beyond broke, and my poor kids are really sick of peanut butter and jelly. 	
t3_2jr9vh	1413779875.0	jables13		Need pizza for a helpless chap in another state.	His situation is...challenging. He's on assistance due to a disability and his caretakers (which we've reported) are spending his money not so much with him in mind. My wife and I have maintained his escape from his situation which is also the way they met (online gaming), but would appreciate any kind soul chipping in for this, maybe randomly throughout the month? We're also up for more suggestions on how to help...I think he can be functional and mostly independent with the right support and encouragement.

t3_2jma39	1413651446.0	Keeble64		Family of 3, struggling with money and medial bills, requesting a decent meal.	I hate asking this, but things have become so difficult over the last couple of months that we can barely keep our head above water. Long story short, my wife suffered a hemorrhagic stroke after giving birth to our daughter last June. My wife's health has greatly improved but requires her to be on blood thinner and anti seizure medicine for at least the next 4-5 years. Her insurance recently dropped her and now we have been paying full price for each prescription full price for the last 2 months (approx. $1500). I work full time plus a part time job but 90% of my income goes to her medicine and keeping a roof over our heads. She cannot work either because she is prone to seizures an considered a high risk.  I was fortunate enough to get paid last Wednesday but all of it went to her medicine and food for my daughter. We were able to have enough for us to purchase some rice an ramen noodles to eat on but have to make due with that until next month.  I think it will bring my wife's spirit up in this difficult time if we could have a decent meal one night. I asked this a few days ago on the other  pizza subreddit but did not have any luck. I have never done this before an am not sure how this properly works so I apologize in advance if I am violating any sub rules.   We live in western Oklahoma in a rural town and only have a Pizza Hut by us. I can only promise to pay the favor forward when we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Until then, thank you.

t3_2goty0	1410982779.0	Backtits69		Boss Delayed My Pay. Feel Like Crap, Pizza Would Be So Nice.	I moved to BC from Ontario about 4 or 5 months ago and just recently terminated my employment at a landscaping company (mostly because it's not my type of work, as I'm more of a smaller guy, but also because my boss had a problem with my "lack of work ethic" and how much effort he deemed I was putting in on a day to day basis.  I'm not going to sit here and bore you guys with details as I could easily make up anything and I'm sure you're all aware of that. Suffice to say my final pay cheque is in the mail on its way to me. If my boss hadn't of insisted on mailing it i could've just picked it up two days ago from his office and not been so tight on groceries right now. If there's any kind souls out there willing to part with their hard earned money to supply a stranger with Pizza, I say, here I am! Much gratitude in advance, simply for reading my short tale.

Unfortunately this isnt enough to order a pizza where i am from (was gonna be lunch). So i figure instead of being hungry and having a gift card i would give it away to someone that could add a few bucks to it and get something to eat. My loss your gain. Just let me know.

Until recently I wasn't aware that I was shadow banned from reddit for posting on that dark knight rises thread awhile back, not sure if anyone remembers. Well, unbeknownst to me, it was a raid by (my best guess) 4chan or somebody, and I also posted "So you guys hear about that dark knight rises?" because EVERYONE was posting it! I didn't get the news apparently. So here I am, posting on reddit for months, thinking I'm just some unfunny loser who never gets le karma, ... and then a moderator informs me.  Anyways, I'm trying to find an apartment but it's hard when all the background checks shit on any chance in hell. I have enough money for a month of rent, barely, so hopefully I can find someone seeking a roommate soon. I'm shaking here, forgot to eat anything all day, just jamming on my computer to find a room for tomorrow.   I'm a vegetarian so if anyone has a heart, please don't troll me with pepperoni.

t3_2edwbq	1408820973.0	gotdamngotaboldck		A month ago my life was fine, now I'm newly homeless, couch surfing in a different part of town, lost my last job, and so hungry.	 Before about a month, everything was great. I had moved in with an old high school friend, in the city. I had reconnected with him whenever he started working for the same private contractor I was. We were each making 500 bucks a week, he lived a lot closer to the place, so I decided to take him up on his offer to let me move in. Things were fine, for a while at least.  I started noticing his habits and rituals and I noticed that he was going into a particular back bedroom a lot. Since I slept on the couch, I never really noticed the other room and always assumed it was some sorta hall closet. I asked him about it and he tried to dodge the question, at which point I got really curious. After a few days of prodding, he caved. He got really serious with me, told me not to say a word to anyone, and showed me a room with a grow tent in it, and inside that tent was 6 fully matured cannabis plants. It was an operation he was running with his buddy. Now here where I live in South Carolina, that's extremely illegal. I mean, I smoke here and there, not as much as I used to, but being around the whole thing made me nervous. I just went with the flow though, never told anyone till now.  Things were going fine for about 2 months. When the growing number of plants started yielding more, though, roommate and his buddy start getting kind of paranoid. They start getting it into their heads that they can't fully trust me because I was brought in on the knowledge of the plants later on as opposed to when they started growing. So things start getting pretty sketchy until one day they're doing acid, I get home, and apparently they had been letting all this paranoia bubble up because they started barraging me with questions and telling me I was lying and whatnot. So some shit goes down where they take my moped, did whatever-who-knows with it, and threw all of my things outside. There was nothing I could do to prove anything about my moped, and I wasn't on a lease, so I had to just kind of leave. So now, here I am a little bit later, I'm sleeping on couches, I've lost my job because I now have no transportation, I eat maybe once or twice every 2, sometimes even 3 days, and I live in a different county now, much more rural so I can't just walk or bus to places like I could in the city. Life has went from great to bad to terrible. There is one ray of light to this bleak tale though; I had a job interview at a Subway today and it looks like I'm gonna get the job. I'll be making less than half of my pay at GSL, but it's better than nothing.  All I want is a pizza so I can actually eat and feel satisfied, energized. This hypothetical pizza is a symbol of hope to me, that if I can get just a little bit of food, I just might make it out of this fuckin' mess. If I can just get a pizza, I will amplify the effects of this act of kindness and generosity as much as I possibly can. Pay it forward, if you will. I'll even compensate whoever I must when I get my first check.	1408821167.0

Now we're pretty broke after getting an apartment and buying things like beds and pots and pans.   Long Story- 15 college grads worked their tails off this summer for a television network that does sports television out of Chicago. The company ended up hiring 7 of us, and 5 of us are living together. And despite getting paid well and free housing during the internship, now that the internship is over we have to provide all of those things for ourselves. After first months rent and buying things like a bed, pots and pans- our pockets are a little light. We start our first day tomorrow and this would be a free pizza would be a very cool thing to gather around.   There's several chain pizza places near our place, a dominoes, a papa johns, and a godfathers pizza. It'd be awesome if the pizza could be delivered around 10 tonight when most of my roomies will be here.

Unfortunately some days ago at her job, a forklift's forks weren't lowered all the way by a coworker, and managed to hit a corner too fast and hit her (on foot) in the lower back. We're lucky she wasn't crippled or killed, but she's extremely shaken and extremely depressed, and coming home from the hospital later today. Work is going to reimburse her for the bills, but in the meantime we had to pay out of pocket, and so we're both broke and exhausted. I think a pizza when she gets home later might get a smile out of her, and I'm hoping someone here could help out with it.

My wonderful dog, my child really, [Cooper](http://imgur.com/FsCSmYS) is excited because he is finally smelling [something](http://imgur.com/KHxfpmc) other than sautéed frozen broccoli or green beans! You have no idea how much this means to me. Life has been extremely difficult with my separation, and this has made a much needed smile fall upon my face. When I am back on my feet, I will be sure to return the favor and bless someone's evening like you did, /u/ash_monster.  Also, I would like to thank /u/Jastha for also offering to send a pizza pie my way all the way from England. The thought definitely counts, and I am grateful for having someone care for a stranger from so far away. I'll be keeping my chin up if you promise to keep yours, mate. :D  Thanks again, and I am truly grateful. I promise to extend this kindness to someone in need as soon as I get back on my feet.

t3_2chtcl	1407064297.0	almostabum		From the streets on up, still in need of a miracle.	I just recently got a room after being homeless in shelters and on the street. I have to give my food stamps for rent, and what little money I get goes towards transportation to the job program I'm in. Its early on Sunday, and I'd love to be able to have a delicious meal for once instead of the usual soup kitchen oatmeal for breakfast and discarded bread the rest of the day.  I haven't eaten a real meal in longer than I can remember. I've never given a pizza on Reddit but try to help people out that are still on the street as much as possible like sharing my floors during storms and giving old clothes to people who can't afford the thrift store like I can because they're usually trying to get high but they're still humans with hearts like the rest of us.  If someone decides to be charitable this day, I'll return pics of me sharing the spirit with some of the less fortunate. Thank you for your generosity.	
t3_2chokx	1407057446.0	slaughter88	shroom	I have a serious question guys.

I've not had much experience on here and I'm a little concerned about this. It may be nothing, I'm probably worrying over nothing, I'd just like to hear some more experienced users opinions on this.   EDIT: Reading the responses of you lot on here has made my year.

t3_2cg785	1407012215.0	GodlessMe	PIF	Lost my job a month ago. Instead of getting my unemployment, I got a denial letter with an incorrect termination reason. Could really use a pick me up.	Long story short, I got sent home from work for arguing with a co worker that was real good friends with the manager. Got sent home, and later that day was told I no longer have a job. I applied for unemployment and just as I'm expecting a check, I get a letter stating that I was terminated for job abandonment. I didn't know being told to go home was considered job abandonment. So the appeal is taking forever, which I think is what they wanted.   So, now I'm completely broke, bills are behind, fridge is empty... Pizza tonight would sure change the mood a little, and be a nice break from buttered noodles. Besides, I'm out of butter.  Oh, and since I'll have like 5 weeks worth of unemployment come in at once, I'll pay it forward as usual. Thanks for reading!

t3_2buc9d	1406443675.0	thekingearl	FAP	[OFFER - CONTEST] $50 you call it girt certificate to the first person to solve the cryptogram inside.	**EDIT 2 -  newzealander won the contest solving it in spite of my drunken typos. Thanks everyone for playing.**  **EDIT - We have a winner. And as predicated I made mistakes. Don't drink and cipher, but at least I predicted my mistakes.**  Below is a simple [substitution cipher cryptogram] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram). I.e. each letter of the alphabet represents another letter. The first person to post the correct solution will win a $50 gift card to the pizza place of their choice.  **The rules.**  1. First person to post the correct answer wins.   2. Please do not edit posts. In the event there is more the one correct response when I check for a winner I will sort by oldest post to determine the winner. Edited posts makes more work / potential confusion for me so all edited posts will be disregarded. You are welcome to change your answer, just please delete your old post and make a new one rather than editing.  3. I have tried my best to double check myself for accuracy. I'm not perfect. If I made a typo or mistake when ciphering that you can catch and still solve the puzzle you get an extra $10.   4. Using a computer program is cheating. Numerous computer programs could quickly solve any simple cipher near instantly. Of course I have no way of knowing if you are using one or not, but on your integrity if you have one please refrain from using it and let everyone play the way the game is intended.   5. I will check back approximately 24 hours from now to see if I have a winner. If so the contest is over. If not I will give a "clue" (i.e. identify one letter). I will continue that habit until someone wins.   6. When someone has won I will edit this post to state that a winner has been declared and the contest over. I will then PM the winner. Once the winner claims their prize I will publicly identify the winner and the correct solution to the cipher (to avoid unscrupulous persons from trying to impersonate the winner IAW this sub's guidelines).   7. You may of course collaborate all you want, but I will award the prize only to the person who posts the right answer. Any deals you make with anyone else to split a prize in a joint effort are on your own.  8. The mods may make any amendments / additions to the rules.  9. The prize is a $50 e-gift card tot he pizza place of your choice. Since I live in the U.S. (Hawaii) I'm generally thinking "Big 3" Pizza Hut / Papa John's / Domino's since I know I can buy you a gift card online and have it sent to you email. But if you live elsewhere, want a different place etc you can have it to wherever you want as long as I can fairly easily buy you a gift card online.   10. Good luck and thanks for playing.  **The Cipher to solve:**  I have attempted to use words that are solvable (i.e double letters, etc). There is no starting "give away" letter, but your clue is the solution answers the following: *Tell me something about yourself.*  Here's the cipher -  **R CSWK WTUVK JA BEUU KRME WIFXRVH D NEATKIHEAJ KI KEA KI ZRV BRBKA PIFFDEW ZIEKQ IB BEUU TROOD. URKQUE R EUDFFA FRYU TROOD, IE R DJ D HRHDVKRN VUEP. TDA JU, KQUYRVHUDEF.**  **Information irrelevent to winning:**  *Why are you doing this?*  I have run contests in the past and had fun. Sometimes I low stakes gamble with my friends. When I win I consider it "found money" since I make a good living already. Hosting online pizza contests is fun, and I like to think that when someone wins them it brightens their day as a small victory, just as my low stakes gambling wins do for me.  *Why $50?*  'Cause I won like a hundy playing golf today. As I said, it makes someone else happy, I have fun running the contest with found money, etc. Plus I figured I probably wouldn't put the effort in to solve the puzzle for a free one topping, but I might for fifty bucks. I like to have big enough prizes that people play my contests. But splitting my golf winnings with you isn't going to change my financial situation at all.  *Why a cryptogram?*  No reason. I've done best picture, scavenger hunt, and stuff in the past. I just wanted to do something different. I figured solve a cipher was something everyone could play, and lots of people enjoy the puzzle game anyways even if there's no free pizza to be had.  *But you admitted that someone could cheat and win with a computer program?*  They sure could. So that's why I called it out. This is supposed to be a fun contest, so hopefully by asking that no one "cheat" to get my pizza giveaway people will be on their integrity and respect that I'm just some anonymous guy giving something away for fun. Let's be honest, a free $50 worth of anything is nice to all of us. But it's not going to change the vast majority of our lives in any significant way. I figure if someone does "cheat" after I've asked them not to they must be really motivated for free pizza, so they might actually really need a couple free meals. I guess I'm okay with someone cheating if they're really in need. Otherwise, I put faith in inherent honesty in humanity.  *You wrote a lot here. Thanks for the wall of text, asshole.*  I told you, I was drinking and golfing with my friends. Drunk typing is a thing. Thanks for reading & good luck!	1406872856.0

t3_2azycx	1405638315.0	UprisingAO		Hi, I am a college student who is fighting to earn back my spot in Professional Paintball, accordingly, too broke to order my own pizza.	So, a little about me.  I have played competitive paintball for almost 13 years.  Right out of high school, I finished 3 years of college.  During this time I opened up my own paintball store, and earned a spot on my first professional paintball team (2011).  The team was located in Portland Oregon, so I moved from Washington to live my dream.  After about a year, I was picked up to play division 1 in the other professional US paintball league.  I put my education on hold when I moved to Portland, and once my lease was up, I moved to Sacramento with my twin brother to be closer to our team from Sacramento.  At this time, I was forced to sell my store, as it was no longer profitable.  In 2013, my division 1 team earned a pro spot.  So I was now playing professionally in both US leagues.  At the end of last season, the 1 league folded, meaning that I would have to pick which team I would play for in the one remaining league.  It was when I had this decision on my plate that I decided to go back to school and finish my degree.  During the offseason, I decided to stay with my original team that took me pro, and I was re-accepted to my college where I had completed 3 years.  Unfortunately, this meant that I had to move away from my twin brother for the first time in my life, play on a different team from him, and on top of that, we were relegated back into Division 1.  So long story short, I am more broke that I've been since high school, away from my brother, and fighting to regain my status as pro in the sport I love.  Video of me talking about paintball. [Social Paintball!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1IrqjNtDIA)  A Pizza would be stellar, as I wait for my next meager check, or for school to start again.

I don't have a lot to offer in return at the moment but If anyone is nice enough to help me out I would be more than willing to pay it forward when I find myself in the situation to do so.

We are on every wait list for housing, and couldn't handle sleeping in the car anymore after I got hit by a car after work.  We have a fridge and a microwave, but it would be so awesome to eat something hot that didn't have to cook in 30 second intervals.

t3_2ahrk0	1405145495.0	plastic_apollo	FAP	Last year, I gave away pizza in return for your help for a Photoshop birthday surprise. I'd like to make it a tradition - details (and goofy dog pics) inside.	Last year, you all had me in absolute tears from laughter with [this magnificent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1hil2c/offeryou_want_a_pizza_i_need_photoshop_skills_for/). You all came through for me in a BIG way, and I was able to make a "Three Eskie Moon" T-shirt for my fiance (and later this year...husband!).   I need your help again.  **Background:** This is our two-year-old American Eskimo dog, Albus. We...love him for who he is. There are 'Alpha' dogs, and then there are WILLFULL TERRORS OF FLUFF. He keeps us laughing. And sobbing. Mostly laughing, though.  **The request**: For those of you who don't know, American Eskimo dogs are neither American nor Eskimos...they were originally called the German Spitz and were very popular with American troops over in Europe. They were brought back to the US and bred by a couple at a place known as the Eskimo kennel, and when WWII tensions picked up, the 'German' fell by the way side, replaced with 'American.'  As a result, we have a running joke about when our dog 'got to the states.' "Oh, Albus, he's from Germany....he arrived here in 1945...nothing suspicious about that..." Or, we'll joke about his cousins 'Maria' and 'Fernando' down in Argentina, where his family is from...circa 1944... We decided years ago that our gecko (who we've had for 8 years!) is Jewish, and as a result, "we can't understand why the dog and him don't get along."  You get the joke.   Well, the joke escalated about six months ago when we found a historic photograph of, *I kid you not*, a Nazi soldier with his American Eskimo dog. I can't even make that up. I know the subject is a bit insensitive, but we did have a good laugh.  **So, here's where you come in:**  [Here is a link](http://imgur.com/a/491CU) to various goofy poses our dog is in (with plenty of .jpg - sorry for the brick quality, but hopefully that won't matter...I'll explain in a second). My personal favorite is the 4th pic of just his head peeking around the wall.  What I'd like you to do is photoshop my dog into situations involving various historical situations/disasters...and *I can't believe I'm saying this*, and I'm *so, so sorry*, but....a few WWII stuff, *if you know what I mean*, would be especially funny. **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE** don't take that to an extreme and put my dog next to piles of corpses or **anything** having to do with extermination/concentration camps - I want this to be light-hearted and give him a good laugh on his birthday, so instead think the background of a Nazi cocktail party or something.  Alternatively, historical disasters work perfectly fine, too. I'm hoping the poor quality of the pictures won't matter since he'll be getting photoshopped into mostly black and white images.   I'll award a tasty pizza from your choice of the Big 3 (Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Papa John's) to whoever makes me laugh the hardest by **Saturday evening, June 12, 6 p.m.** US only!   Thank you for helping us laugh again this year. Looking forward to your submissions!   **Edit: A winner has been chosen :)**	1405203973.0

Been unemployed for about a month and a half now, living in a small town sucks when nobody is hiring.I'm down to my last couple bucks and low on gas, but I do have a few interviews on Monday. So, a nice pizza would really make things a little easier, take some stress off a bit, you can only eat so much ramen and rice before you want to scream Dx.   Once I get my job back, I have no problem returning the favor again :] I usually go for something cheap, the Dominos pasta box, after tax and delivery it's only about 15$, but that would help me a huge amount!

t3_27zr0w	1402603847.0	iamaredditer	pizza	(Request) I thought it would be nice to organize a pizza party for the RCMP of Moncton, New Brunswick.	I was looking at the photos of the poor officers killed by a mad man and thought maybe we could throw the officers a pizza party to maybe lift their spirits off of their slain brothers.   I'm sure there are people way more organized to pull this off but here's a little bit of help.  The address is   520 Main Street Moncton, N.B. E1C 8P2  Phone number is  506-857-2400  At least I think that is correct. Please feel free to correct me and help make this happen.   Here's to you Canada!

t3_27uxux	1402470630.0	thekingearl	FAP	[Offer / Contest] Pizza Party Scavenger Hunt Follow Up...I was late in declaring a winner for my contest so a $50 follow up prize could be yours.	I was the guy who hosted the [pizza party scavenger hunt](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/279tw8/offer_contest_lets_play_pizza_party_scavenger/) but said I'd declare a winner Sunday night. My life got in the way and I didn't declare a winner until just now (winner has been PMed but not publicly declared until they claim). As such I owe reddit a penance for being late (I can afford it..I'm doing okay in life). So here's a follow up scavenger hunt: **The hardest item to find in the original was a TMNT3 on VHS.** Since pizza is appropriate for TMNT fans I will give a $50 to the first person to post a picture of a slip of paper with their user name next to a collection of all three 90s TMNT movies (in any format...VHS/DVD/whatever) as well as action figures of all four turtles plus Shredder, plus Krang, plus Splinter. Any edition (new or old) of the action figures is okay. Can be new or from our childhood.   **Rules** Post a picture of a slip of paper next to your movies and action figures and you win if you're the first in. See rules from my previous contest for details (read: no photoshopping).  **EDIT 1** I'll accept a screenshot of a digi copy of the movies since this is otherwise impossible for anyone other than a freak fanatic as far as I'm concerned.  **EDIT 2** I don't care if you actually own the figures. if you wanna go to the store and snap a pic of the figures on the shelf and pair with your digi of the movies go for it.**  **EDIT 3: u/tizzytenderloin has claimed his prize. We're working the details of what pizza place he prefers!**	1402645704.0

PM if you're down. He's bored as hell and is hella lonely because none of our housemates are around today. I figured this would be a great surprise for him, unfortunately I'm also a broke college student just like him. haha Help it out!

My fiancée and I were wondering if someone could make this day just a little easier and send us a pizza for dinner? We would greatly appreciate it. <3

t3_27f96z	1402008556.0	Squ1dkins		Request: Employed again after 2 months with no job	Well about 3 months ago I moved into an apartment and 3 weeks after that I found out my job was closing. After 2 months of being unemployed, I have finally found another job. I was able to have enough money to pay rent for the last two months but at the beginning of last month my car decided to crap out on me, Unfortunately with bills and my car I haven't even been able to afford the simplest items in my home including food. I have found another job but don't start until Sunday morning. If anyone would be willing to help a brother out with a pizza or two please let me know. 	
t3_27ccv6	1401930490.0	Husker83		Request Rough time right now Oklahoma City, Oklahoma	So I heard about this pizza forum and although I have never ask for a handout I thought it was worth a shot. I believe in paying it forward and have always done so when I can.  I was injured in a train wreck a few years back and screwed up my shoulder pretty bad having had multiple surgeries on my rotator cuff. I became addicted to the pain medication and have been trying to kick the habit. I have been clean 1 week now and am finally feeling hungry again after being very sick. Unfortunately I had to take time off work and could not get paid and I don't make much anyway.   I have what's left of my case of ramen noodles and a half jar of pickles in my fridge until next Friday to eat. I'm sure I will make it but a pizza sure does sound good. I don't know exactly how this works so I apologize.   Do I need to give out my city, state and address? How would someone go about sending me a pizza. I have a dog named Zeus as well. I'm sure he would like a slice lol. I only had enough money to buy food or either him or me and of course I bought the food for him. I would rather starve then see my pup go hungry. As I said I'm not starving though I have almost half a case of ramen noodles left so if someone else is starving get them the pizza instead of me.   Thanks you and have a wonderful evening! 	
t3_279tw8	1401863886.0	thekingearl	FAP	[OFFER - CONTEST] Let's play pizza party scavenger hunt. Lot's of people ask for free pizza. Anyone willing to play a game for the chance to win a you call it $100 pizza party?	**The basics**  The game is a scavenger hunt. If you're not familiar with scavenger hunts you should get out of the house more, but the basic idea is below is a list of ten (10) items not commonly found in every day life for you to seek out and find. First one to collect all ten items wins a $100 gift card to the pizza place of your choice (only restriction is that I must be able to buy you a gift card online with relative ease. I'm looking big three U.S. but if you're international or have a local spot I'll work with you as we can.).  **The rules**  Find all ten (10) items listed below. Take a picture of the item with a slip of paper next to it with your user name, the phrase "pizza party scavenger hunt" and the date next to it. Upload your pictures to an album on a picture hosting site (imgur, photobucket, whatever). First person to find all ten with their pictures properly processed wins a $100 gift card to the pizza place of their choice. Mods may impose additional rules at their discretion and as always 60 days or older accounts only can win. In the event more than one person has completed the hunt prior to my declaring a winner the first person in/posted wins.  **Specifics**  No photoshopping obviously. The idea is to find the actual physical items. If I suspect photoshopping I reserve the right to DQ anyone. If I DQ you you can appeal to me by PM and send another photo if there is some debate but I reserve right to final ruling. So make it obvious it's a real photo. Your face etc need not be in the photo, just the slip of paper. Same for the requirements of people in the photo, feel free to blur faces. You are welcome to recruit friends to help so not all photos/papers need to have the same handwriting. Get your friends to help you. The prize is a pizza party anyways - you're not really going to eat $100 of pizza by yourself are you? I will check back Sunday (8 June) night my time (in Hawaii, USA) to see if I have a winner. If so they will be notified of their win via PM and then it published. If not, I will continue checking day to day until someone does win with the same protocol being followed.  **The scavenger list**  1. A copy of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III" on VHS (VHS only - IMO the hardest item to find on the list).  2. Any "Legend of Zelda" video game.  3. A box of "Fruit Loops."  4. A female wearing any type of "bunny ears" (homemade acceptable - face may be blurred).  5. A male giving the "shaka" (not shocker)/hang loose/surfer thumb and pinky Hawaiian sign (face may be blurred). Google if you don't know. I like in Hawaii so its a thing here.  6. A remote controlled car.  7. Any super hero action figure.  8. Three or more people giving a "thumbs up" (faces may be blurred).  9. A carton of milk (in any volume....can be plastic, cardboard, whatever).  10. Any movie poster.  **Information irrelevant to winning**   Why are you doing this?  I'm bored and have $100 to spare. I'm curious to see if people who ask for free pizza will put in an effort for free pizza.  Why a $100 pizza party?  I definitely wouldn't hunt this garbage down for a $15 pie, but might for a hundy. Figured it was the going rate.  How did you come up the scavenger hunt items?  My Tuesday night poker buddies are as drunk as I am. We all threw in random crap. Random was the idea.  What is the purpose?  Someone gets a free pizza party. Maybe they have fun "earning" it. Maybe not. We'll see I guess.  **Good luck.**  **I have PMed the winner. Congratulations to them. I'll post their username after they claim (IAW the sub's guidelines to ensure he is the one I give the pizza to). Sorry about the delay (I know I said Sunday night) in declaring a winner, I had some work/personal life stuff come up that kept me from my lazy man reddit time. Thanks everyone for playing and I hope the winner enjoys his free pizza. It was fun and I'll do it again sometime. Thanks as well to the nice guy as well who gave me gold. I didn't even really believe that was a thing until now. I'll prob do another one next month or something since I had fun doing it.**       **---WINNER DECLARED: u/nesswithanL has claimed his prize and we're working out the details. Can't believe how quickly he produced a copy of TMNT III on VHS. That's some pizza worthy stuff right there.---**	1402558276.0

We just narrowly avoided being evicted (if the bank had taken another $20 we wouldn't have been able to make rent), and 3/4 of the house has some kind of nasty cold.  So for obvious reasons, everyone is in an unpleasant mood. I think it would probably help everyone a lot if we could get a cheap pizza

t3_271yd7	1401654210.0	ShirakFaeryn	PIF	[NW Ohio Request] Moved 2 weeks ago but had to replace beds, couches, furniture, and large appliances.	Family and I finally got out of the slumlord apartment complex we were in and now live in a cozy house with a landlord who so far seems pretty reasonable. Unfortunately there was a pest control issue in the apartment so we had to leave behind any cloth furniture, as well as treat all of our clothes and most of what we brought with us to make sure it didn't spread to our new house. The house also didn't come with any large appliances.  Landlord has been taking payments on the rent/deposit since we had so much to replace, unfortunately the payments have left very little for other bills and food so we've been living off of 2 meals a day of rice, pancakes and some ramen.  Everything should be caught back up by the end of the month but my family and I would love some pizza to break the monotony. We will pay it forward when the bills are caught up, whether or not we get some pizza today :)

I've called the cops obviously but until then I don't have any family or anything to fall back on. And I don't have any money since she took my wallet, ad the banks are closed now. I don't even know how I'm going to get home from work. Or too work tommorow.

(look inside)	Edit: We have a winner everybody congrats /u/BeardFlakes and enjoy your ZA! See you guys next week! :)   As the title says. A large Za bread or cinnamon sticks and a liter of any drink you want. 15 facts about me obviously from my post history.  BUT one wrong fact and you're disqualified. If no one can get 15 when this post is 12 hours old then whoever has the most true wins. Been here for about 1.5 years so 15 should be doable but not impossible.  And please no personal information. City i live in is OK but anything more in depth or where i live at or name or anything is an instant DQ.  If youre in the city i live in then maybe we will meet up and enjoy some pizza and you can have one to take home also.   Good luck to everyone. :)   Edit: And please if you have gotten pizza within the last week or two let someone else have it. And also facts cant be extremely related. for example saying i live in Dallas (i dont) and that i live in Texas will only count as one  Edit 2. Contest still good. One medium pizza being sent out on a technicality. 	1396622326.0

We both had decent paying jobs that we loved, both local businesses, not chain stores. Both businesses had to downsize around the same time. So along with a bunch of other people we got laid off. We had about two months of savings and those have been depleted. We've basically been pawning everything we own and looking for jobs all day everyday to no avail in this small of a town. So, if anybody could buy a pizza we would have dinner for a few days. it would be much appreciated! :)

t3_20z5d9	1395382431.0	jubjubmacrub		(Gifting Pizza) Anyone living in Adelaide (Australia) on here? Had a shit month and i'd like to make someone else's a little better. Story inside.	So, this month in Adelaide has been "Mad March", where we have the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Clipsal 500, Writers Week, all sorts if events. Basically its the month that you have the most fun in in my City.   But for me it's been a bit different. It started with me getting a $900 fine from a policeman after checking my mobile phone at a stop light. Not so great. Then a week later my little Jack Russell of 11 years got attacked by another dog and had to have emergency surgery on her throat. She survived a week in intensive care, making steady progress but on Thursday had a massive organ failure and had to be put down.   I won't lie, i've been as low as i've known for a long time. I'd just like to make someone else's month a little better.   For those of you needing some cheesy love in Adelaide, PM me your details and i'll help you out. I can only afford one as I am a full time student so money is kind of scarce (even more so after the $900 fine).  Anyway, thanks for at least listening to my rant.

t3_1xk52i	1392072373.0	julie_DLT		Flat broke and spent the last of my cash to feed my dog. Please help!	Hey guys,  Normally I'm not a sob story kinda gal, but these past 2 weeks have been super rough for me and my family. I recently relocated back to Sacramento from the Bay Area because my dad lost his job and my uncle is in the ICU battling the horrible flu that's been going around here, so I wanted to be here however I could to support them. When I got here, it turns out the job opportunity I had here fell through which added a ton of stress to me because I spent the last of my money saved up on moving costs. My checking account currently has 33 cents in it until my tax return comes in later this week and I used the last of my cash on a bag of food for my dog since he's old and I'd rather myself be hungry than him. The remaining cash I used on ramen which is about to run out.  I've never posted here before and I would love to return the favor as soon as I get a steady income coming in. We (my dad and I) are not picky whatsoever as far as pizza goes, but I am a vegetarian so I'll eat anything as long as there's no meat!   Thanks for reading and all that you guys do here. Hope you have a terrific Monday :)  -Julie

My fathers drywall business turns 30 years old in January and was wanting to create a logo commemorating the thirty years. A logo I could put on a hat for him a t-shirt and maybe even use on his social media accounts and website.   I've never asked for anything in return when gifting pizzas on here so I'm not really sure how this works. Hope I'm not using any poor etiquette of this sub by doing this. 	1387242055.0

I never thought I'd use this but I'm really hungry and I don't have much in my kitchen anymore. I've had the shittiest semester ever. Over the course of my semester, my car was broken into and my purse/credit card/cash stolen. I had to pay $200 for a locksmith to open up my apartment after leaving my keys inside(which was my own stupid fault). I got fired from my job and I'm probably failing my hardest science class. And to top it all off I got into a wreck last week and my first car ever was totaled and I went to the ER. I just got my hospital bill today and I'm WAY too scared to open it. Now I'm studying for a final tomorrow and all i want is a nice redditor that would buy me a pizza to get me through this night of studying for finals.   I'll definitely pay it forward once things settle down next semester. Thanks for looking and good luck studying, everyone

But, I had a friend suggest this to me. I've never posted here before, and in hopes that it works, I'd like to feed my small family tonight. I'm normally low-carb, but the one thing I REALLY miss is pizza. I hate the idea of asking for help, but I'm running out of options. I'm not even sure how this works, honestly, but I wouldn't mind blowing my carb count for something delicious. Random strangers, could you help a brother out? I know this is the wrong time of year to ask for favors, as money is tight, and any other circumstance, I would never ask to begin with. A man who can't even afford to feed his own family, makes me feel very depressed. I hate to do this, but, it's kinda my last option. I'm not happy about this post, but if it comes through, I don't know what my reaction will be. EDIT: We both have good jobs, and can normally afford our lifestyle, but we had some unexpected expenses this last couple of weeks that have really crippled our financial situation. I.E.

t3_1rnxmd	1385668528.0	joZeizzle	shroom	(Request) [40390] A plea for help from my fellow Americans on this day of thanks..	**I already posted this in /r/thanksgiving, as I didn't know something like this existed.**  I find myself, on this day of thanks, sitting alone in my apartment. Plans were made, but fell through at the last moment.   The past year of my life has been extremely trying, and painful. Death in the family, messy break-up, and getting laid off at my job are the major issues. I don't have a penny to feed myself with (literaelly, I'm totally broke after paying rent) and my belly is rumbling.   I would merely visit a homeless shelter or soup kitchen, but I live in a small town, there is nothing of the sort within a 20 mile radius. I'm also socially awkward and have very few friends, all of which are enjoying this day with their families, as it should be. Are there any generous, loving Redditors out there that would be willing to spend $10-$15 to help a stranger fill his belly on Thanksgiving?   I don't know what else to do but swallow my pride and ask for help on a website that has kept me distracted in this hell that I've called life lately. I will be here all day. PM me if you're feeling generous, I would be for ever indebted to you.   Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. Despite my position I still have many things to be grateful for. I have a job, albeit awful pay/grueling work. There is a roof over my head. I have two amazing friends, who I know would be here with me if their plans allowed it. This is the day to put those things first and foremost in our minds!   Thank you for reading this, whether or not you plan on replying to my plea. Have an excellent day, everyone.	
t3_1rnofr	1385661176.0	IdolBone		Are you a graphic designer in need of pizza?	Hello fellow redditors,  I am here to offer a pizza in exchange for a poster made for my band, Idol Bones. I have all the fancy graphic design files you will need (for MAC or PC) in order to create this potential masterpiece. Here is a poster for one of our previous headline gigs - http://imgur.com/cMS97pz. As you can see, it's rather boring. Is there anyone out there who feels they could make a better one in exchange for a pizza? The poster is for our comeback to playing live (we are recording/writing the next 3 months) March 1st 2014 at "Cheri's Bar" so along with the date stated, would need our logo and also "plus special guests" as a mention to our support acts. I realise pizza doesn't buy me too much design time but feel free to exercise full creativity. We have a lot of energy and don't take ourselves too seriously, using humour at will.   Let me know anyway and we can talk more, it would be so cool to have a poster made via reddit and if I could help out someone with their favourite Italian pie, all the better.  One love!

Request (Des Plaines, Il)	I'm not starving or deperate, and after seeing the other requests I feel I there are many people that need a pizza more than me. But, if they are taken care of and someone would still like to buy me a pie, I'd greatly appreciate it and next month the pizza can be on me.	
t3_1pk4ws	1383160717.0	crysania46and2	shroom	[ Request] Today is my real life cake day.	Today is my birthday after being out of work for eight months I don't get my first paycheck until Monday. A pizza would be an awesome gift. Thank you. 	
t3_1pietb	1383099226.0	datcrazybok	datcrazybok	[Offer/Contest] Need someone to talk to. Will trade a whole pizza of slices for a small slice of your reddit time over the next month or so.	EDIT: This subreddit is amazing. More people offered to let me PM them than even asked for pizza. The people I chose, one of them PMed me, and I don't even know if she wants pizza yet. The other, blarglznoflo, CONGRATS, and thanks to everyone I bother over the next few months.   TL;DR You're not getting any pizza if you don't read.   I need some help. Really, I just need someone to listen, and shoot me a reply every so often. And it would help if your replies sounded like... positive, or uplifiting, but kind of cynical and witty, too.  So... I have a fiance, right... She told me years ago that she had this warrant from Oklahoma before we got together. I never really thought much of it, I didn't even know anything about it. Until this weekend.   We went to the lake this weekend, Patagonia. It is down near the US/Mexico border. We took a little bit of weed, because we smoke pot. We've never had a problem before, but... this time, there was a dog out. The dog hit on my car. I was honest with the Border Patrol agent, told him I had a pipe and a small amount of weed.   They were so great. When I realized they were going to arrest me for the weed, I asked the guy to not let my son see them handcuff me. He told my fiance to take my son around the corner, and he put the handcuffs on. Then, he asked me if I was going to be cool, because they really didn't like to be dicks or anything, but they had a job to do. He said if I was going to be cool, they would take the handcuffs off. So, they did. I thought I was going to jail, though, at that point. I would have rather it been me.  THEN, they found my fiance's warrant. They told me that they were going to charge me, confiscate my weed, then drop the charges. They said that if they arrested me for the weed and took her in on the warrant, then CPS would have to come get my son. They said we seemed like nice people and good parents, and that they weren't out to destroy anyone's lives. If Child Protective Services would have had to come get my son, I would have just died.  Anyways, turns out this felony warrant is an extraditable, no bond warrant. She signed a waiver of extradition, so now Oklahoma has 30 days to get her. If they don't, she gets released. If they do, she gets a free trip to Oklahoma and a stay in their prisons while we get this straightened out. Or, Oklahoma can send a form saying they aren't coming, and she gets released immediately.   So, now, I'm a single father for a while. I'm not equipped for this. My fiance is my rock. She is my everything. I don't know how I can possibly make it for 3 days without her. I have to do 30, probably. We're trying to get a lawyer in Oklahoma to plead to lesser charges for her, but I don't know...   I live 1,000 miles away from the nearest family member I have. She's got an uncle in East Mesa, but I don't know him. I've got 2 friends. A couple, so when I go see one, I go to see them both. And they're not exactly easy to talk to about stuff. I'm introverted. Extremely. I come online for my release.   I really just need someone to turn my little envelope orange a couple dozen times over the next few months. Someone I can just log on and type a huge narrative to that I will feel like will give a shit.   I also have another requirement. Another redditor let me vent to him the other night. I told him about RAOP, and attempted to Pizza him. He declined, said he really didn't need it. I told him I would give a pizza in his name. I would really appreciate if if whoever gets pizza would message him and thank him for the pizza, for me.   Last caveat: This is a double offer. Once this is all said and done, I will buy you another pizza, for all of your troubles. I hope to give it to someone who will pay it forward some day. Or, you can donate your second pizza as your pay it forward. Totally your call.   I'm not sure who I'm looking to give the pizza to. I guess I will probably just go off of instincts based on your reply, so I can pizza someone I connect with.   Thanks, in advance, for the small slice of your reddit time.   	1383107922.0

t3_1p9e5u	1382803566.0	TheMidgardSerpent		So damn hungry	This is my first experience with RAOP so I'm not exactly sure how this works. I've never been someone to accept handouts and to be honest I'm not expecting this to work, but I saw you guys mentioned in another thread and I figured it couldn't hurt to check it out. Before 2 months ago I was enrolled in a program at my local community college. I was accepted into the program because my step-father is a 100% disabled vet, and they paid for my tuition as well as gave me a 900 dollar stipend to live on. Well recently they shut my program down (at least to family members, the vets themselves can still go) and I've found myself without a job or any money. Unfortunately pizza is the last of my problems considering I will be homeless in 5 days if a miracle doesn't happen, but I'm so goddamn hungry. Ate the last of my Ramen two days ago, and survived the day yesterday by eating my last bag of popcorn. I'm more than happy to share more of my story (like anyone wants to hear that) and do whatever it takes to get verified. Again, I've never done anything like this before so I'm not expecting anything, but the more my stomach growls the more desperate I get to try anything. Oh, I live in Charleston, SC by the way.   EDIT: I just want to give a big thank you to /u/Whisperers. **She** tried **her** damnedest to get me a pizza tonight, but because she lives in the UK it just wasn't possible. The poor gal tried sending it online, sending me an e-giftcard, and then finally just calling them (long distance i might add) to see if they'd take her card over the phone, all to no avail. I may not have gotten a pizza tonight, but I did learn that there are truly some good-hearted people out there and I want them to know that I appreciate it.  2nd edit: /u/whisperers is not a he, made corrections.	1382840663.0

After winning, she never messaged me back. Kinda bummed out but I got over it, then a week later she messaged me saying that she was in the hospital and she felt bad for making me wait.  She then awarded me with a 30$ gift card. I couldn't believe it.   The day she messaged me, my ex-gf had broken up with me so I ordered a pizza to make me feel better.   I just realized that I still have money left on that gift card and I just ordered a large pizza for me and my new gf.   Thank you so much u/minivansareevil for being an amazing person, I know its a small act, but it really did make my day, even if it was 7 months ago.   **TL;DR: Got pizza from /u/minivansareevil 7 months ago on the day I got broken up with, finally I'm using it on me and my new gf.

All I've had to eat for the past couple of months has been rice, beans, and ramen (occasionally some other food thanks to my awesome roommate and other friends), but I ran out of beans and ramen two days ago.

I don't know if it matters, but I deleted some other posts I made on this subreddit about 3 months ago (when I lost my job), not knowing that one of the rules is to not delete posts.

The 5-9 year olds have come to our house a few times asking to play in the back yard since there are no actual grassy areas within the block. They are really nice boys.

I blew a 0.01 at the station, and have to wait until court in December to get the record expunged.   The reason I am coming to you, RAOP, is that I lost all my money when I went to jail, due to booking fees. I work part-time at a local pizza place, but am off tomorrow, my last day until payday. I don't have any food to eat tomorrow, and it would make my off day a lot less painful to my stomach.  I will gladly re-pizza someone in a few weeks when I have an off-rent check.

t3_1l3e13	1377485728.0	ThatEpicBaldGuy		Never thought I'd be asking for this..... Kelowna Canada.	I never wanted to ever ask for help but hear it goes. I just moved to kelowna at the beginning of the month with a full time job. Half way through the month I got my first paycheck but was less then 1/3 of what I was expecting to get. Thought I got enough food to last till the end of this month but with no funds I haven't eaten In two days now and don't know what I'm gonna do for til the end of the month... I never thought I'd be asking complete strangers for help but hear it is. One thing that I can promise is I will pay it forward. As soon as possible I would help out someone else in the same situation as I believe in real karma not the reddit kind. 	
t3_1l2oxb	1377463303.0	measter29	shroom	Young couple here. Very tough times. Literally broke with nothing to eat.	Request fulfilled. Thank you tigerowitatoo  Hi there. I'm posting cause I know folks here really help and only ask that you pay it forward.  My gf and I live together and our roommate just up and left last month. Weve struggled to cover our bills and thankfully,  should have a new roomie in time for next month. If anyone could help with a pizza wed be grateful.  She doesnt know I'm doing this.  The fact its Sunday and were both off of work and hungry is really making the situation seem bad.  Help me put some cheer in our evening. Thanks. 	1377482411.0

t3_1ktmu2	1377112615.0	so817	FAP	(Offer) Pizza anyone?	I've been pizza'd before and thought now would be time to pay it forward... So who wants it? No bs rules or anything like that, just post anything below and I will draw one lucky person to receive a $20 gift card to one of the big 3. The only requirement is that your account has to be at least one month old. First 50 posts will be eligible.   Oh yeah, and for those who love to downvote other posts to try to move yours to the top, don't try it. -_-  I will be using random.org to draw a random name so it would be pointless. Contest closes after 50 posts (I don't feel like copying and pasting more than 50 names to the randomizer, lol).   Good luck!   Edit: I gotta bounce at around 5:30PM (ET) so the contest will end at that time OR after 50 posts, which ever comes first!  Edit 2: **CONTEST CLOSED!!! WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOON..**  Edit 3: **WINNER ANNOUNCED!** I went ahead and added in 51 people (since I miscalculated)... As I said before, I used random.org to draw a winner. The person that is #1 on the list is the winner and I will PM you soon!   [Click here](http://i.imgur.com/KHy5XiT.png) to find out if you've won!   Edit 4: Hmmm I think I just got scammed; something seems fishy about our winner....Messaging the mods.     **FINAL EDIT**: It turns out that the "winner" ***cough*** /u/avaughn70 ***cough*** used a fake account that was created a month ago but only active as of yesterday. He/she deleted the account once I sent out the Ecard. I believe that it was a person who entered in twice (once with a real account and once with this fake account)... It's my fault because I should have been more clear about the rules about having an active account.... Welp, lesson learned.  I will still hold this contest again next week so stay tuned *legit*, RAOP'ers! 	1377123305.0

t3_1k3srd	1376164913.0	Dragon_Snapper	pizza-gold	[Received] from 2days, thank you	Too funny, but saw this person on the cookie page, wanting to trade pizza for cookies, by the time I found the post, his situation changed, and I felt he needed pizza more and he was reluctant to accept anyway long story short, after much chatting he finally accepted a pizza from me saying he would return the favor back, and he did. I really like this, paying it forward to others, but also to those that have given to you.  I have seen people say all the reasons and stories why they should have one, yet this was the first I actually had to insist they accept, ha ha ha.  It is not about just giving to those who say they need, but giving to those whom the giver wants to give to for whatever reason. My reason for him was, he gives a lot here, he does fun games here, and I really want to send him some of my husbands awesome fudge when the weather is colder and it wont melt to a warm chocolatey blob.  2days, thank you again, and have a great weekend.

I work two jobs this summer but I'm just not getting enough hours and I'm beyond broke at this point. I use to work with my dad doing carpentry but recently he just got diagnosed with cancer in his esophagus, right after I got done with chemo for leukemia (maybe you saw my post on r/getmotivated?). I pretty much burnt any extra cash driving back and forth everyday I could when he was in the hospital.   I'm by no means gonna starve (I still have noodles and peanut butter sandwiches) but if someone wants to send a pizza my way I'd really appreciate it. I just hope my luck starts to change!

t3_1iaxs2	1373844174.0	kmamrsr		(Request) Pathetic couple in search of pizza to replace the holes in our hearts after losing our car to a pack of homeless people under a bridge. More in comments.	Recently among our other financial woes we lost our car to a colony of homeless people under the I10 bridge in New Orleans.  In addition to smashing almost all the glass and beating the sides with what we believe was a golf club, they also stole my SO's suits which were in the backseat.  While we noticed several of these fine citizens sporting some ill fitting business attire, we chose not to approach.  We found the backseat around 50 yards away, but decided to leave that behind as well since a couple of very friendly men were in the process of making it their fuck pad.  Everything that could physically be taken was, but they left us something in return!  They took a big poop in the trunk!  Alas we miss the Mitsubishi Lancer, and the only thing that could possibly dissipate our grief is a delicious hot pizza.   Can provide pictures of car as well as pictures of our really cute dog.  Thank you to fordgawn for the delicious Bacon Pizza!!!!	1373852824.0

t3_1hs0zx	1373158782.0	shamann00dle	shroom	43, in trouble and just learning to accept help	A little over a month ago, my partner of 10+ years moved out (still friends), I was working a ton of hours and just trying to hold it together.  Then I had an accident where I went through a window, fell 30 feet and smacked in the concrete sidewalk.  I broke ribs on one side, ripped part of my cheek of on one side,  completely shattered my elbow, broke the arm bone betweene between elbow and shoulder , hurt left hand so it is hard to use, severred the tendons and nerves on right hand and more.  It took roughly 7 hours in the emergency room to remove the glass which was everywhere.  The largest piece was probably 7 x 2 inches.  I was in the trauma ward for approximately 8 days. They released me but I could just barely do what I needed to do like get up and go to the restroom (doing much better now).  The ex took the bed so Im sleeping on a sleeping pad (barely better than the floor) with broken everything.  A few days ago, my boss asked me to come to the office and talk.  They were really supportive while I was in the ICU, offering to get a nurse to help me at home, telling me I had nothing to worry about job-wise and whatnot.  The meeting was me getting fired for attendance so I basically was fired for being in the hospital/recouping at home.  In a few days, I have to go to court.  For going through the window, I received a citation for FELONY criminal mischeif.  The only trouble I've ever been in was a traffic ticket 20 years ago. Now I'm looking at possible jail time.    I'm looking at being homeless while not completely being able to take care of myself or being in jail.  Jail might be better.  So....good people of Reddit.... it has taken this extreme situation to finally be able to reach out and ask for help.  **I** am the one who helps.  It is **me** that sends the pizza.  Getting help makes me uncomfortable and actually asking for it..... did not happen until this level of need.  That being said...   I would love a pizza.  If you message me, please realize that it is hard for me to type.  It may take a while or I might be brief.  The above took at least 45 minutes.  [Here I am straining to keep my arm up for the picture](http://imgur.com/s5ljQLp)  TL;DR - partner left me, impaled myself on glass and fell three stories, got fired, got a felony charge, have a very good chance of being homeless in a few weeks and am having a hard time taking care of myself

I cant put it in any other terms because this week has been crap. Me and my wife have been trying to have another baby for 2 years (our first passed away from trisomy 13 2 years ago), and after all this time we were finally blessed with another pregnancy. I live in the Cleveland area now and all my family lives in California, so I wanted to fly out with my wife and surprise them.  On the day we were supposed to leave though my wife was experiencing horrible cramps so we went to the er. after doing a ultrasound they found out the pregnancy was ectopic and she had to have one of her tubes removed. After the cost of the er and the cancellation fee for the airplane we are way more broke than we are used to. If anything im sure there are people who deserve a free pizza way more than me. I think i just needed to vent and have someone listen. So thank you for reading this.

A pizza would make my arrested development sob marathon a little better	Deleted my other post as I didn't want to mislead anyone into thinking it was a different situation. Sorry.  My 7 year old Siamese cat, Okgirl, came down with pancreatitis late Friday. Took her to the vet today to find the damage was severe, dropped a monstrous amount of money on X-rays and blood scans and cremation. Held her on my lap and locked eye contact when she went, today has been the toughest day of my life. Anyways I know these are supposed to be random, but I plan to watch TV all day tomorrow to decompress and a pizza would be a godsend. I've included some pictures because she was an amazing and beautiful girl.  http://imgur.com/dCtyOhJ http://imgur.com/wT3QrQQ http://imgur.com/1Pv4wSh http://imgur.com/15GvsSF http://imgur.com/FDJbvj6 - this is her lying in my lap after I suffered a compression fracture this winter.

Spare A Slice? :)	To sum it up, I am a hungry lonely 27yr old cyclist gal in Austin, TX completely broke and severly injured with a broken back(hit on my bike while commuting to work).. will trade 'sexy' emergency room pic for some (vegetarian)pie <3  for the long version, please read below. thank you in advance. ride safe.    hey folks, im an avid cyclist in Austin, TX and was hit head on (they came racing around a corner/blind spot going the wrong way in a one way) this past winter while commuting to work. Needless to say, I was pretty badly roughed up, the worst of the injuries resulting in compression fractures of my spine, with the compressed vertibrates losing around 45% height. Since that time, I was completely bed bound for nearly two months, have been in and out of the hospital, have severely limited mobility, and after a stay in the hosptial last week a new MRI showed that my bones arent healing correctly and have further deteriorated. I found out yesterday that I am going to need back surgery if I ever hope to have my life back. I have so much anxiety given all the risks involved, but need so badly to get back to my life that it seems like the only option. I have no health insurance and have not been able to work since my accident, as I was a bartender and waitress. Since Ive been unable to work I lost my jobs, and have gone completely broke with out of pocket medical bills, an expensive brace and medications, etc. I qualified for 3 months of emergeny food stamps, but since I hadnt been 'looking for work' (I have severly limited/restricted mobility with extreme pain so have not been able to work or, do anything) during that time they wouldnt renew them. Basically, Im hungry lonely and broke. Ive struggled to keep my spirits high over these months, but to be honest, today I just cant shake it. I know pizza wont fix all my problems, but it would sure put a smile on my face and some food in my belly. Thank you for listening, didnt want to go overboard(this long ramble is still a summary) so if you have any questions or want details feel free to ask.   Advice? As a side note, the operation I need done is called Kyphoplasty. Due to my lack of health insurance to have this operation that will hopefully give me my life/mobility back I need to pay out of pocket. The cost of the operation is $5,000. I have never seen that much money in my life :/ I qualified for the Medical Assistance Program of Austin's insurance, MAP, (which has helped with some perscription costs and hospital visits) but also found out today that it wont cover the spine surgery, basically because its not life or death(I will LIVE without the operation, just severely crippled :/.. honestly, im not really convinced that this is living). If anyone has information or suggestions on resources or funding for my situation it would be greatly appreciated. Im pretty overwhelmed and any ideas or suggestions  would be a great help. Thanks guys, sorry to ramble. As you can imagine, Im dealing with a lot of information and emotions right now. Been keeping my head up though. If you have a second but cant send a veg-pizza, please send some positive vibrations and healing energy my way? Thank you. x	1368571526.0

t3_1di9cq	1367442708.0	darkmooninc	shroom	Follow up to previous request. [Recieved]	Here's an overview of what happened. I was in dire straights. Medical problems and only one income for three adults and a child has strained our financial situation. On Friday April 19th I looked into my bank account and [realized the worst had come.](http://i.imgur.com/cwgRVrT.jpg) That's negative $26. We had no food in the fridge for adults and I was crushed in despair under my situation.  Then someone on /r/trees posted a delicious picture of [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/4Ec6Qyb.jpg) (My god that is still delicious looking...) which I decided to [comment on.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1cqf0p/pizza/c9j05w3)  Now in hindsight maybe I should have just stayed quiet but the hunger was on me something fierce. From that post, I was given the idea to try /r/RandomActsOfPizza and /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza . Now, I'm hesitant because I work hard for what little money I have and begging seems depressing. But, I have a [wife and child](http://i.imgur.com/Di5vxyr.jpg) and a [recently unemployed roommate](http://i.imgur.com/PnX4wnP.jpg) who are all really important to me. But I asked. Which [I capped the original post into a pic.](http://i.imgur.com/BSbVsqx.jpg)  I made the post as I went in to work that night. And in my cubby box work had given me [a pair of free tickets to a certain event.](http://i.imgur.com/UnoVdlT.jpg) We'll get back to that.  So I spent work from midnight till eight in the morning waiting to see how things would turn out. I got a response from [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots) quickly, in offer to get us pizza. I was hesitant and wasn't sure how reliable anyone is on the internet, so I replied and asked, maybe begged, for just a pizza. Just one pizza maybe, you know? Remind me what it's like to eat a fatty meal, but a filling one at that. Then a response by  [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne) offering pizza. I should have said no. But it sounded like I might get two pizzas. Shame on me, I guess. Then another person [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay) sent a pizza. 3 whole pizzas!  I did in many of these cases try to let them know that someone else already helped, but they seemed insistent. I told them to send pizzas in the evening.  Me and the wife and our daughter left to go see [muppets](http://i.imgur.com/Oh5zOUa.jpg) and watch a free show work comped me. [It was crazy and my daughter loved it.](http://i.imgur.com/VEfmQB2.jpg) I had barely enough gas to get there and back before the gas light came on, which just meant I would be walking to work the next week. But it's worth it, you know? [It's worth it to see her eyes light up.](http://i.imgur.com/NrKAqLxh.jpg)  So I return home to find pizzas. Pizzas everywhere. They came while we were at the show, and our roommate had received them. My memory is hazy who got what, and I didn't take many pictures, but I'll try and make the correct associations there.  donny_pots and mm_kay both sent me pizzas, I think three total between them. But it was dehOne who made me cry.  dehOne first sent me [this amazing spread of food.](http://i.imgur.com/xzFnycJh.jpg) which was a weekend meal enough as is, not to mentiuon mm_kay and donny_pot's gifts above. But then dehOne went one step further. I got $25 in Paypal which was the reason I could get to work on gas the next week. And then my email got this amazing thing: [this gift card](http://i.imgur.com/NW0lK8j.jpg). What do you do for that? My wife and I were stunned with tears. [This picture doesn't account for the fifth pizza we ate and the side items.](http://i.imgur.com/R0P6ZMS.jpg) but I can tell you that the following week we were fed. Lastly, at the end of that day, I found someone had gifted me a month of Reddit Gold.  So there you go Reddit. I asked for maybe a pizza or two. My pessimism told me no one would really help, it was wrong. With negative money, next to empty gas, an empty fridge, and a lot of stress I asked you guys for help. And you helped. About ten pizzas, $25 in my gas tank, a Sesame Street show (not you guys technically but I still thank you), and enough food to get us to a paycheck where we can eat real food finally.  Thank you. I love you all. Thank you so much. I feel terrible still, as the situation is barely improving. Random Acts is not for long term. I don't really want to ask for help again, I need to just get a second job. But thank you for this brief relief from the stress. Thank you [donny_pots](http://www.reddit.com/user/donny_pots), thank you [mm_kay](http://www.reddit.com/user/mm_kay), and thank you a big bunch [dehOne](http://www.reddit.com/user/dehOne).  Thank you all.  I hope my next big post is how I have more money than I know what to do with and have bought 20 pizzas for people on Reddit.

I have some money coming in tomorrow from a babysitting job, but right now I am very low on food and had to pay the last of my cash towards my very late rent. I'm pretty down on my luck and just upset in general. Nothing would make me happier or feel better than a fresh, hot, cheesy pizza to fill my empty belly. I would love to pay it forward tomorrow when I have the extra money in my pockets. I'm the one who believes in paying for the person behind me at a tollbooth, just because I can. Unfortunately, today just isn't one of those days. Any kind souls out there? I've never used this before. I have a verification code.

In return I can either pay it forward when I can, or order a pizza for you down the road once I'm back on my feet. Thanks in advance  :)  *Edit - I know, I know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. I'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even Domino's sounds great right now. But I don't have a preference between the three. Whatever is the cheapest still works for me.   *Edit 2 - If you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, I'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. I'm still unsure how this all works....am I supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via PM?   *Edit 3 - Well, this isn't getting any attention and my stomach is gurgling all the same, so I'm just going to scrounge for the evening. Short of a miracle in the job department I'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great.  	1361245329.0

t3_18ezgk	1360719733.0	dam360	pizza	$20 to your choice of the Big 3 (U.S. Only)!!!	I'm a huge cosplay fan. As a result, this contest will involve you dressing up as your favorite... well, ANYTHING!!! The rules are as follows...  1. All accounts must be at least 1 month old.  2. I understand that your dying aunt left you out of her will and is trying to have your kids sent over to N. Korea to work for cheap labor to pay of your uncle's debt. That doesn't mean I will give you the $20 card. In fact, I will more than likely just forget to read it.  3. You may dress up as anything. If you love anime, dress up as your favorite character. If there's a celebrity you love, dress up as that person. If you like trees, dress up as a tree. The possibilities are endless. I will choose my favorite.  4. The deadline is Friday at 8:00pm CT. Any post after that is disqualified.  5. All posts must be verified. To those who don't know what verifying a post means, it means you have to have the picture include your username. You cannot just find something off of the internet. If you know someone who dresses up a lot, you can take a picture of them. If you dress up a lot, take a picture of yourself. If you aren't either of the above, get creative!!!  I hope y'all have lots of fun with this. Good luck, and happy hunting!!!  **The winner is AllergicToDeath. Congratulations sir.**	1360980056.0

My tax money has been in my account since yesterday morning, but since my card is somehow not working at the atm I have to wait until tomorrow morning when the banks open to withdraw money. To add insult to injury, the prepaid debit card I have that holds all the money I get from donating plasma has a hold on it because the guy at the gas station screwed up.

I just got home from school, frustrated, stressed out, and generally dismayed when all of the sudden there was pizza in my face. I looked behind the slice to see my short bearded Hebrew roomie with a big smile and a story to tell. Needless to say, I am a much happier person now. Also, I will be offering a free large 2 topper and a 2-liter on payday (March 1st, I know its three weeks away, but someone will be hungry) to whoever hits me up first. I've never bought pizza for anyone on reddit before so if there is some kind of etiquette, I am unaware of it.  Again, thank you stranger.

t3_17z5oh	1360119798.0	instant_japanese	pizza-gold	The prodigal son returns. 	It has been about six months since I was last here but I have fresh student loans and would like to do a quick kindness. I'm going to give two ten dollar pizza cards out tonight. Anything that makes your post more interesting will be more likely to get you one because I obviously can't buy one for every single person. If you want to do some of my statistics hmwk, that's definitely a plus. It's not hard, i'm just lazy and drunk. But anything to distinguish yourself. I'm sorry if you don't get the card but I can't afford to buy one for everyone. So anyway, two up for grabs. Let the hungry come forth and get fed. I went three days without eating before my money showed up today so I know the feeling. Fire away.  EDIT: i forgot to put offer in the title. if any mods can change that i'd much appreciate it. but if not, it seems people are finding it anyway.    EDIT 2 AND 3 DELETED FOR BREVITY AND THE FACT THEY ARE NOW POINTLESS  Edit: ok apparently one more. only one of the three has reported getting their pizza. i believe the one who received it was one who ordered from dominoes. I think the other two may be pizza hut. I've only had a problem with someone not getting their pizza card one other time and i was out 10 dollars and they were out a meal. so if they come through, please let me know. if not i'm going to have to avoid using these methods for the fact it's money disappearing for no ones benefit. 	1360125423.0

Dominos have a 50% off code. You may have to pay for something like cookies to bulk up your order depending on your minimum delivery cost in your area, but we have basically just ordered a pizza and some cookies, total came to just over £25. 50% off means it cost us £13 something, and we'll get a tenner back. So we've basically just paid for the cookies!!

My sister, [losermedia](http://www.reddit.com/user/losermedia) came over to help me pick a winner, and we couldn't decide! So, we have two winners! And those people are....  **dielectric_eating** - For their facts about parrots! Too cute!   and  **modernmist** - For their facts about the sun. The conversation eventually led to a documentary being posted about a man who makes music with the [sun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcqiLvHiACQ), and it was one of the most beautiful and creative things I had seen in so long. Data Sonification....what an amazing idea.   So thanks everyone for paricipating again! I promise to keep doing these contests...it's so much fun, and I feel like all of us walked away having learned at least one fact that we didn't know before we started reading the thread!    ::::::::: Hello my favorite lovely pizza friends! Last week I had a contest asking for everyone's favorite dinosaur, and it was a hit! So my sister and I were talking this evening, and we wanted to offer another pizza, along those same lines.  So here is this week's contest: What is your favorite **fact**? It can be a historical fact, or a science fact, it could even be something about your favorite musician...the sky is the limit. Just do me a favor and link to an article (even from Wiki) that provides some proof about your fact. One of the best things about last weeks contest was reading about so many critters I had never even heard of.   So for example, my fact is one that was posted here on Reddit a few days ago. Apparently one out of every six stars has it's own Earth sized planet in orbit around it! That...is amazing. [Here's](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2013/pr201301.html) the article in case you missed it:   My [sisters'](http://www.reddit.com/user/losermedia) fact is that a cats purr vibrates at a level that actually has healing properties towards humans! [Here](http://consciouscat.net/2009/09/14/the-cats-purr-a-biomechanical-healing-mechanism/) is a brief article about it.  To make sure this contest gets some momentum, we're going to wait to pick a winner until Sunday afternoon. And please feel free to duke it out and discuss why your fact is the **best** fact! Keep it civil though, hehe.   This contest is for the USA. And if you're the winner, you will be to chose from one of the big 3! Unless of course you have a local spot that will accept GC purchases from their website.  :D  	1358714252.0

I just have been incredibly stressed lately, but today I feel happy. I feel like I am feeling the warmth of the sun although its cloudy outside.  I am just feeling happy and pizza would make me even happier!   I woke up so I am happy. I have a roof over my head so I am happy. I have health and most of all I have friends and family so I am happy.  It's easy to think about what would don't have but it's harder to choose to be positive and happy.  So... I am in Delaware, USA and while I am already happy, I could be even happier with Pizza. :-)  Stay positive all!   **Edit: Just wanted to thank you all and just remind everyone, no matter what's going on in your life to try to think positive and just breath, you will never live this moment again.**	1358479167.0

t3_16mu8y	1358278009.0	PodAwful		(REQUEST) Brooklyn, NY. I do a show in exchange for pizza funds.	I've been doing a comedy show online for over 3 years now. As the show has gotten more popular, and my bank account has begun to dwindle due to: girlfriend secretly moving out on me on Christmas day leaving me with a huge electric bill she was supposed to be paying, no luck finding roommates, having to go to court, having a terrible job, and living in one of the most expensive cities all while paying to keep the show going, I've realized that often over the years my fans donations have gone to delicious New York pizza keeping me from dying.  I recently started something on the show called "The Pizza Fund." A few of my regular listeners have signed up and things are just getting going. A fan sent me this link, I had no idea this existed, and it could have probably really helped out in some of the recent tough times. If you would like to check out what I'm doing, here is a link http://podawful.com/support  This is a cool thing you guys are doing, always something amazing and new on Reddit.

t3_15n41o	1356817848.0	spacitymedic	shroom	Freezing in my truck tonight...	Hi RAOP'ers... I requested a pizza once last year and I cant tell you how grateful I was for it. I was working for the fire department and I was broke and homeless, and I gotta tell you- it made my day.  But these days, things are possibly worse. Back then I had the love of my Fire Department and my chief, housing me in the empty fire station while I worked. But now, I live in Georgia and I'm looking for work and I lost my roommate so I lost the apartment. That truck I've been sleeping in is going to get repossessed next week if I don't come up with something fast. I've applied for every job under the sun and I'm just waiting to hear back from them now.   I feel like a schmuck asking again... but if anyone could help me out. I will no doubt, when I get a job, spend twice what you spend on a pizza to help someone else. I meant to do it in the past, but never got around to it. Life got hectic...   But I have sunk every bit of cash I had into gasoline for my truck, cause I have to have it running in order to keep looking for jobs. I havent eaten since thursday night, and it's beginning to hurt. I figured I could tough it out but I was wrong.  So, thats my plight. I would be forever grateful for a pizza if someone would be willing to contribute.  I know things are going to get better for me... cause my god they can't get any worse!!  Thanks a million, everyone.  Broke & Frozen in Georgia, Desiree

I've always wanted to do a RAoP but I never seem to leave cash on my debit card (They put my check on to a debit card and it costs me ~$1.25 extra for any transaction) or really remember that I've wanted to give one out.  Well tonight I was thinking about RAoP while working after leaving the gas station I go to multiple times every single day.  Tonight I went in as I do everynight, put $10 my tank, grab two gatorades an a pack of newport shorts.  This cashier is my age and I can tell he's a stand up guy so we're always shooting the shit about pretty much anything.  He was telling me about how he was bummed that he was working all Christmas Eve and Christmas day.  I felt bad so when I got to work I placed and order for closing time (Major chain, It's not free :/), once the time came I hooked his taco pizza up with extras of all the fixings and hid a gift card under the pizza.  Paid for it, punched out and took off to the gas station.  Man, I could tell by the look on his face how much it meant to him that someone out there did this for him, I just wish I could see the reaction on his face when he finds the gift card.  I'm not here for any kind of applaud or hoorahs, just wanted to share that giving feels great and much respect and kudos to those that do RAoP.

How do you let others know just how awesome of a person someone is? I don't think there really is a way.   **nlevesque3** really made my day. Not only was he kind enough to help with Pizza which was more than enough, he also helped with some PT aides I really needed for my husband.  He is amazing. Very kind, generous, caring and compassionate. Something that I think embodies so many of us.  So thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!!

t3_12rnp5	1352255145.0	postmom		(Request)Exhausted Mom in Des Moines, Iowa 	          Hope sometimes comes in pizza form...   I have gone back and forth on if you all need to know why you should get us a pizza or if I should just say "We have been through a lot a something as simple as a pizza would give us some hope"   For those who think that isn't enough here ya go...  We started off the year with just me working, our oven breaking (thank God the stovetop still works) and our furance breaking. After using all our saving to replace the furance we found out Im pregnant. Which was a complete surprise to us because in Feb of 2011 I was told I would never be able to have children. In May I was put on medical leave because of my fibermyalgia. I have disability insurance from my job, but it has never paid out. (A) found a job in March, but was only making 2/3 of what I did alone becuz of this we couldnt keep everything on and pay on mortage, if the insurance doesnt pay out soon we go into foreclosure.  Most of my pregnancy I ate cereal lots of it because it's what we could afford. At the end of August since I hadnt had income for 90 days I finally was able to get EBT which has given us more food, but for anyone who has even been on assistance it doesnt go very far.  Where we live we have one food pantry that falls in our zipcode, but because our bills come in the last week of the month we have only a few day to get food. Since you must have current month mail to show your address since it's the end of the month there is little left. Lots of people would turn to their family for help in this situtation, but in my case both my parents have died, my Mom on Aug 19th 2009 & my Dad Oct, 19th 1997 so there is no family to help me out.  Just when we get a little hope with the EBT we find out my (A) is losing the job he just got in March becuz they are closing the building and becuz they moved back his start date by 1 wk he doesnt get unemployment. My due date was Sept 21, his last day of work was Sept 7th. Our Baby was born 13 days late and is the joy that keeps us going.  We focus on the wise words of Winston Churhill "When you are going through Hell, keep going." Yet, it's hard to keep your hopes up. I am personally not a huge fan of pizza, but my (A) loves it beyond words so I know it would do a lot for his spirits to have a pizza & I would love not to cook for one night.  Please & Thank you.

Well two weeks ago I was able to get alot accomplished, I had finally caught up on my CC payments, I have two more payments on my car before its paid off and I'm finally moved into my new place. However a few days ago I learned that my identity had been stolen. Apparently there was a keylogger on my desktop and they snatched my bank account number. After struggling to get ahead financially I had finally had a safety net for emergencies. That is now gone. Whoever stole my account number completely cleaned out my account in the form of an electronic check which the bank never notified my for verification. I have no money and my next car payment is due on the 15th. I have no idea what to do and I'm running out of food. A pizza would alleviate a couple days worth of groceries, and maybe I can pawn a few things to make my car payment. Can anyone help?

We have submitted request before with wonderful repsonse from some wonderful redditors in the reddit community. Today I am happy to announce that 2 of our girls will be leaving our home. 1 is being reunited with her family. ( which is our ultimate goal). and the other is aging out. (meaning she turned 18 on Saturday). The county does help them with housing and as long as they remain in school, they will receive a monthly check to help them make the transition into adult hood so aging out is not a bad thing, but still sad for some of the girls as they have become sisters over the years... My name is Connie and I am a Mentor and Volunteer. a few of the Moderators know who we are and can verify my post. We currently have 11 girls staying here for different reasons such as Orphaned, runaways, wards of the state, or cases pending in family court. and We rely on both public and private donations. sometimes the girls need a break from the stress of being here and I would like to as the reddit community if they would please provide dinner for the girls tonight. It would be a nice break for them. the email is light.ofhope@aol.com or you can PM for further information,	1349816334.0

t3_115th4	1349734333.0	math_is_hardly		Thank you Dranai!	I never thought anyone would offer to help me. This is definitely the highlight of my entire year. I want to share what Dranai has done for me. He generously sent me a card out of the goodness of his heart. There aren't many good people like this left in the world. Some forget how hard it is to simply find the motivation to go on. To feel like you belong in this world.  This gift of dinner was the spark that reminded me that someone thought of me. That someone cared enough to help me. It took me a few moments to respond because I was in such disbelief. I'm eternally grateful to Dranai for not only helping to feed me but to lift my spirits as well. I hope I am able to return this favor soon.   I made this post because I felt Dranai should be recognized and receive the praise that they deserve. The world needs more kindness, compassion, and hope. Dranai has given me all these things today. I will move forward as a stronger man.Thank you.

t3_10qkmw	1349053997.0	Xbet		Home Depot Random Act of Pizza.	Me and user Kdude900 were driving past a Home Depot Sunday, when we noticed all the men out front looking and waiting for work. It was a hot humid day, and thats when it hit us. We needed to get them a pizza. We found a pizza place near by (it was a Little Caesars) and we then proceeded to buy 2 large pizzas, one pepperoni and one cheese. As we drove back to the Home Depot we weren't quite sure what reaction we were going to get. Upon reaching the parking lot we hopped out of the car and carried the pizzas over towards the 10 men standing around. It was the most awesome moment ever!!! Their faces lit up and they thanked us over and over again. It was a great feeling knowing that you made someone else happy. Because of this me and a few friends one of them is a fellow redditor Kdude900, are going to start giving out as many free pizzas as we can to people less fortunate then ourselves or just people who are using all their strength to provide for there families. Maybe it doesn't seem like much, but it is. Giving them a pizza shows them that people care about them and also keeps there spirits high. I wish I had pictures to show but I didn't have my camera with me. So I will link a pictures in the comments below when we do it again.   I hope you enjoyed this story and if you want to do this too just start buying and handing out pizzas in your city. :D    If you want to help but don't want to go out and find people yourself you are welcome to paypal me donations at ejlerbettenhausen@gmail.com. I will send you a picture of the person who gets the pizza you donated that way you know its not a scam. I highly suggest you do it yourself because the feeling of making someone happy is better then anything.	1349072131.0

She tested into the 4-5 year old group!  The head coach said she is extremely strong, tall and agile for her age -- as well as listens astoundingly well!  I am one proud mama... Just hoping to maybe suprise her with some Pizza Hut tonight!  We have one right across the street and she asks me for some every day.  Thanks for reading!  And letting me brag!

t3_zqi9x	1347405703.0	morningjojo		No groceries:(	Hi reddit, this is my first post. I have been laid off of my job for six months, recently found another and have been working. My problem is they cut my unemployment because of hours worked so I have been living on nothing for a week and a half. I have a family of four and I get paid in the morning, but we are hungry tonight. Is there any way reddit could help us get a pizza for dinner tonight? My teenagers would be very grateful.

t3_yylwh	1346162267.0	herpderpster		So, I got scammed by a Redditor on /r/RandomActsofPizza last night. (x-post)	***[UPDATE]***: Redditor bfeliciano was kind enough to buy a pizza for the true victim of the scam, the guy who asked for pizza in the first place! As long as he got his pie, I'm happy, and the world is good again. :)   I like to read /r/RandomActsofPizza and /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza because they provide evidence that people still do good things for other people. It's fun to read the stories and see people's reactions to having their request for pizza met, even though it's a small thing. Just some people giving what they can to help their fellow man.     Anyway, last night I was reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/yvk0b/broke_till_the_1st_feel_like_shit_after_quitting/) thread, and gave props to the OP after he was heavily criticized for quitting smoking because of his girlfriend's pregnancy scare, and then continued to quit after it turned out to be negative. Later, I asked him to PM me about pizza.     Afterwards, I went off Reddit for a couple of hours and then remembered my message, so I went back on and found several messages from whom I thought was one person. It turns out, the messages were from two people. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/9WcJY.png) is my inbox, which shows the messages. I was suspicious, because 999rafica responded twice, and then I had another message saying that he just got my message to PM me. I figured, hey, he probably saw my comment on the thread and then my PM so he sent me multiple replies. Or maybe he was excited about pizza and wondered why I didn't respond for a couple of hours.     I ended up replying to the most-recent message, which was from ***999raffca***. The legitimate user's name is 999raff***i***ca, but I didn't notice the spelling difference until it was too late. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/user/999raffca) is the scammer's user profile. It was made right before he messaged me, proving that the account was made specifically to fool me. I guess I wasn't too concerned about getting scammed on a subreddit that's supposed to be about giving out of the random kindness of your heart.     Anyway, I don't know what Reddit wants me to do about this, but because the purchase (which was an e-gift certificate to Domino's) was made by me, I can't file it as fraud with my bank, and because the code was already used, Domino's isn't going to refund me.     I guess I just want everyone out there to know that people suck, regardless of what you think. Not everybody sucks--but enough people do that it's hard, and often unwise, to trust anyone.	1346277455.0

t3_ynfrm	1345660720.0	GrumioSwag		[Story] I was graced with an unexpected free pizza today and would like to share the story, post similar experiences.	I have a favorite local pizza place that I order from very often. Today me and my brothers ordered a large pepperoni, gyro, and cheese read to share. When it arrived I went to pay and the delivery guy asked if we were interested in a green pepper, onion, and sausage pizza. I figured he was trying to sell a messed up order so I politely declined at first, but then he said it was free. The order was meant to have mushrooms instead of sausage so they kept it. When they recognized my address he said his boss told him to give it to us for being such loyal customers. It made my day that eating pizza paid off with more pizza. It was really good business, and makes me love the place even more. Has anyone ever experienced something similar?

t3_ybei1	1345118896.0	Roth1	FAP	[Offer-ish] Movie tickets?	Hey guys, I work at a movie theater in the Englewood CO area and I get free tickets to pretty much any movie (titles like Batman will be off limits first week or so). I was wondering if anyone would like to go with me, I'd just love to make some friends (17/M). I'd prefer to meet up there if possible!	
t3_y961t	1345023019.0	Detrituss		Inverse acts of pizza	So I was just heading to the corner store just now and saw the pizza delivery guy get out of his car and trudge towards me. Poor dude looked so sad, kinda touched me a little. I felt like I should do something for this poor man. Obviously approaching middle age, and for reasons unknown stuck working this crappy job. Or maybe it's a second job that he has to work at night to pay for medcine for a sick child... who knows. The look on this face shows it could be many things, nothing or that he was simply having a bad, bad day.   A few meters down the road I saw his car and realise he'd delivered to our house many times (it's the best pizza place in town). Tipping in my country just doesn't happen. It's not protocol, so on my way out of the store I remembered this thread and thought: "Why not an act of kindness for the one who brings us such nice, soothing treats". So, as I walk past his car, I glance around to make sure he's not around and slip a $10 in the windshield wiper (all the cash I had). Then, like a creature of the night, I slink back into the shadows.   I walk up the street a little, to the corner of my road and stand in the shadow of a large house where I can see his car clearly, but cannot be seen. There are other people walking around and I want to make sure he gets the money, not some passer by.   After a while I see him emerge from the house he was in. Slouching along slowly, cap brim bent down, almost vertical. His tall frame hunched and a red pizza carrier limply dangling from his right hand. He approaches the car from the front. I'd put the money on the drivers side to make sure he sees it, at least when he's in the car it would be obvious, but from his angle of approach, and the fact that the car is directly under a street light, I can tell that he will spot it as soon as he's within 4 or 5 feet of the car.   As he gets closer I tense up. What if he spots me? What will his reaction to finding free money be? Will I make someones day just that little bit more bearable?  All of these things flash though my mind and suddenly I feel that this gesture has become all about me and making myself feel good! I'm conflicted. My conscience pulled this way and that. Did I do this for the pizza guy, for myself, or both?   The last things I remember are a thundering of deep horns and flashing lights. Have I been spotted, or is it my confuddled mind playing tricks on me? I stare into the lights and see teeth. Familiar teeth. They boom at me "Hey, Detrituss! What are you doing in the shadows! you look like big scary man yes!! HaHaHa!!". It's my flatmate in his car. He spotted me as he rounded the corner and began tooting and shouting. I glance down the road and see the Pizza man, obviously shocked at the commotion, quickly get in his car and drive away swiftly. As he goes past I can make out through the glare of high-beams the flimsy blue ten dollar note pressed against the glass.   I hope he sees it before it blows away. 	1345939951.0
t3_y8w7b	1345006844.0	OneSalvie	shroom	(REQUEST) CALIFORNIA - Caught my girlfriend making out with one of my friends...now drinking alone, craving some pizza ):	Hey reddit, im basically feeling like crap right now. I have a history of falling for the wrong girls but this one really hurt. I took my girl  (soon to be ex I guess) to the movies and dropped her off since she said she had to be home early. After dropping her off I realized I had to go back and give her this small gift I had gotten her that I had forgotten about. That's when I found her getting in a car and when I got closer I saw her kissing some guy that wasn't really my friend but I did know him through mutual friends. I dont know what to do, im just gunna drink a bit (not an alcoholic or anything) but I need to relax, I wasnt really in love with her but I was getting there and im just bummed out, I actually spent all my money on the movies I took her to today, and now just starving, depressed, drinking and craving a damn pizza. That would be awesome, not really expecting a pizza but that would be awesome, just had to rant a bit sorry guys.

t3_y6tgw	1344922859.0	misterrareza	shroom	I spread the love to my 1 year old nephew	Not technically RAoP, but I used a $30 gift card Tygerlily sent to me for my one year old nephew and his parents (South East Michigan) who are in a bad way right now, financially. Used the rest of the money to buy them a pizza and cheese bread from Pizza Hut. I was told it was my nephew's first pizza and he was in awe of it! Sorry, no photos, they don't own a digital camera :( Just wanted to say thanks for RAoP existing! If it wasn't for the gift card given to me, I couldn't have given them the gift as well, as I'm unemployed. :3	
t3_y380g	1344767038.0	Valladian	shroom	(Request) Trying to tide over until payday, not doing the best right now --Atlanta GA--	Hey all how's it hanging? I haven't posted on here in a bit but right now I'm in sort of a bind. Right now I have little in the way of food, I am dealing with a montage of health and financial problems that makes my budget tight. Noodles and canned veggies kind of tight. I've had to be resourceful and start doing a lot of home repairs myself because money isn't there to fix things. I ran out of gas for the mower and had to cut the front and back by hand with a weed whacker. Dishwasher broke so I had to tackle that (amazingly I fixed it). I even had some adventures in the attic courtesy of a leak in the roof. It's just been screwy lately, and being sick all the time doesn't help much.  I've received on here before but right now foods not exactly in abundance around here lol If someone could light up my weekend with some dinner that'd be great. Thanks for reading and have a good one regardless.	
t3_y2y77	1344747338.0	Suddenwords		Hey guys. A person over on /suicidewatch is celebrating his birthday alone tomorrow. I figure we can help him with some pizza. 	His screen name's [Bedre](http://www.reddit.com/user/Bedre), and for the last hour I've been consulting with him. I promised him I'd try everything to help him enjoy a day where he "feels loved once." Help me out guys, if you can. PM him and get an address as he hasn't responded to me. If I get the address in time, I'll update it here. Thanks.   Edit: Her* name's Bedre. HAR! I'm embarrassed. Also, thank you for the mass outpour of your efforts to contact her and give her kind words and pizza-related certificates, coupons, pizza itself, etc.  This was my first post in /raop, and I can't thank you enough. Often times it's difficult to read a sad story and truly believe that you can do something to help. Every single little thing you do helps. Even having them in your thoughts help.   A special thanks to Hagane17 for his efforts to reach out to her. We made contact, baby.   And to top it off, she was so modest that she asked me to give my raop favor to another person, which I'm going to do. Look out /suicidewatch, somebody's going to get a pizza from an Irishman. 	1344793300.0

t3_y0o2l	1344634896.0	balakain	shroom	(REQUEST) Anyone kind enough to help make my little brother-in-law's birthday better with some pizza?	Hello Reddit,  I hope you are doing well. My little brother-in-law's birthday just passed on Wednesday, he turned 9 and is awesome! This is us about two years ago, with my little sister-in-law too. http://i.imgur.com/wLU0z.jpg?1  He lives with his Mom because his Father is in jail. His name is Noah. Noah has four other siblings, including my husband. Their Grandma also lives with them. My husband and I live separately. Anyway, you can imagine how hard it is for a single mother to support four children and her mother all on her own. She barely gets by on bills and often gets help from local churches and the community. She is constantly struggling.   My husband and I are by no means well off either. We live paycheck to paycheck. Tomorrow we wanted to celebrate his birthday some how. His Mom, nor us, can throw a party for him because we don't have the money to. None of us can even afford to buy food/cake if we were to have a party and invite his friends from school.  We planned on going to a museum around here and then to the discount theaters because Grandma hasn't seen a movie in a theater in over 30 years!! At $6 for children and $9 for adults we can't really afford to do the museum anymore though so we are just going to watch The Hunger Games at $2 a ticket tomorrow. We've got some Reese Cup muffin mix we are going to make up into some sort of birthday cake for him.  Both his Mom and my husband and I are on food stamps. My husband and I actually had to get them a few things earlier this month as they were all out and hungry. We now have nothing. His Mom was supposed to get hers renewed today but after going to the grocery store, shopping and having to deal with the embarrassment of not being able to buy your food after finding out something must have went wrong...had to leave the store without groceries.  Anyways, I don't know how we are supposed to feed everyone. The movies are close to my house so they will be coming here for the cake and stuff but we don't have any food, certainly not enough to feed all 6 of them and ourselves too.   I thought tomorrow surprising them all with pizza would be amazing! It would feel so nice to to have that weight lifted of my mother-in-law. We don't even have gifts or anything for the kid. Last week WoW was on sale for $20, all the expansions and my husband and I got him that while we still had a little money left but we already gave that to him.  I know Domino's has some kind of 50% pizza deal I believe, I saw it advertised on Facebook I think. Obviously if anyone is kind enough to help out, you can choose anywhere, we are not picky - but since there are a lot of us I just thought that we might get more for less there.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I know this is a big request and anything will help. If I am needed to do anything, please let me know.

t3_xtydk	1344359724.0	aliceann93		(Request) London, Kentucky. Need help feeding kids. Will repay. Please help.	Well where do I start? Two years ago the love of my life dumped me because for 6 months before that I had become a drinking machine. It wasn't just when I was depressed. I would drink when I was happy, sad, hungry, tired, stressed. I would even go to work and school drunk. It became a major problem when I got alcohol poisoning. To keep her from leaving I agreed to quit drinking completely and start going to meetings. Suprisingly, it worked and I was on the fast track to living a much better (happier) booze free lifestyle. In the past month my girlfriend and I have argued constantly. Thursday night she confessed she had been cheating on me for about three months with my bestfriend, who had also helped me stop drinking. My gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and "one thing just lead to another" and they had fallen inlove. This had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when I got custody of him. Yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. I tried to go about my day the way I would any other day, I went to my AA meeting got my 24 months sober token. I went to work and got through the day as best I could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. After work I went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. I didn't know what else to do. I wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. I don't know how I am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live. My bills are adding up quickly and we have no food. My landlord is very strict and will not bend on my rent because we've only lived here for 90 day. I am but sure what to do. School starts next week and I can't get supplies or outfits. I used my last bit of gas to go to a food pantry only to find out that I make too much money for assistance and I can't get a payday loan because I got one two weeks ago to help fix my now exs car. I hope someone here can help me or direct me somewhere I can get help. Thank you for reading.

I'm here to ask if someone would be decent enough to help me with some dinner tonight or tomorrow while I take care of my kids. I've been separated for nearly ten months now. I drank myself half to death and now I'm working on getting myself back to my feet. I don't have a job and my brother has been paying my rent plus utilities for the last two months. He can't afford to give me anymore cash at he moment, he suggested I try here because you gave him some pizza a while back. I really don't want to feed my kids the same slop I gave them last time. Fish sticks and macaroni, a side of applesauce, they hate it and I practically eat it nightly. I've got two young girls to feed, if someone could help me I'd never forget it. Hopefully that way their mother won't be so hesitant to let them spend the night with me next time they ask to. I'm here if you have any questions or if I left anything out. Hope you'll be well.

t3_x9qvy	1343427255.0	BIGMc_LARGEHUGE	FAP	(Thanks) mmmcandy	I've never been on the receiving end of getting a pizza besides winning a contest and this persons generosity literally just moved me to tears. Thanks a ton for this. The next pizza I'm able to give will be in honor of them	
t3_x9b2w	1343412287.0	BIGMc_LARGEHUGE	FAP	(Request)Union City NJ.Had a rough week, low on funds, pizza would help	I'm normally able to gift but I've. Had a rough 2 weeks financially. Last Monday I found out my roommate has been in jail since the first so I had to pay his portion of the rent with the little savings I did have(thankfully my landlord has been a saint in regards to half of the rent being late). Then last Weds my fridge died so I had to use a good portion of the check I received on Tuesday to get a replacement and the day after that I forgetfully left my backpack on the bus I take to work with my work boots and cell phone in it, so I had to replace both of those items. I work in a restaurant so I've been able to eat there but I am off today and tomorrow and have exactly enough left to get me to and from work until my next payday Tuesday. If someone could help me out that'd be super cool. If you live close to me id be able to hook it up with a discount at the Outback I work at sometime, if not Id at least be able to pay it back or forward after Tuesday. Thanks for at least reading this and I hope to be able to pizza someone again real soon	
t3_x85ep	1343355826.0	wtfsven		I'm going home.  Just short of 4 years in.	On August 3rd, I'll be heading home with my wife and boys.  October 7th will have been 4 years in to a 6 year enlistment in the US Air Force.  During my last deployment, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.  From then on, I kept hearing differing stories on whether I could stay in with such a diagnosis.  I never really got much of a straight answer.  But I *was* handed discharge papers.  General Under Honorable Conditions.  Which I suppose is fair given the truth of the reason behind it:  "Minor Disciplinary Infractions," the majority of these being Failure to Go, which in my case means sleeping in.  The thing is, I have had this problem as far back as I can remember.  I'll go months at a time being horribly depressed, then anxious, then completely apathetic.  I want it to stop.  I want to be happy.  But I can't.  In Afghanistan it got to the point where the only way I could be woken up is by someone coming into my room and waking me.  I'd sleep through my alarms.  I'd sleep through the gunfire and mortar attacks.  I'd get to work and not care about anything.  This got me in quite a bit of trouble over there, which was the last straw for my command.  But in truth it was actually a good thing.  It took being out there with no one but myself and my fellow Airmen to step back and recognize my pattern; something I've been trying to figure out for years.  After seeing the mental health facility down range, they told me to see a psych here at home station.  I did.  Which is a whole story on its own.  One day my psychiatrist told me he will start the process of medical retirement to make sure I get continued care.  That was on a Friday.  The following Monday I was served the discharge package.  Now it's not all bad.  I'm on meds now and feel better than I have as far back as I can remember.  I still get the GI Bill and guaranteed health care through the VA for at least 5 years.  So the truth is, other than having about 3 weeks (one left!) to line up a house and a job almost 2000 miles away with no money other than my next paycheck to live on, things are actually starting to look up.  It's a new start.  And I'm looking forward to it.  Just wanted to share.  Thanks for reading.	
t3_x4oro	1343223013.0	LuvBubble	pizza	Just a heads up regarding International RoAPs	I learned the hard way last night that if you're trying to buy a pizza for someone internationally, you're going to have a bad time.  In order for me to make good on my word, I sent money to the person via PayPal.    The moral of the story is that if you're in another country from the person requesting the pizza, it is most likely not going to work out for the both of you.  I wasn't sure if this was already brought to light or not, but I wanted to share my pains with you guys.  Despite the bullshit that we both went through, I would totally do this again.  Keep on Gifting Pizzas people!

t3_wnwt1	1342472556.0	meanstreaklarry		(Request) My waters been cutoff, I literally have nothing I can cook without it. Stockbridge, GA	I've had a lot happen in the last year but I'm always trying to be positive and keep my head from sinking. I rode my water bill too long this time around. Now just a few days before I could pay them it's been shut off, and they've made it clear they won't cut it back on without payment first. I live mostly off instant noodles and macaroni, now I can't even boil water for a cup of tea. Right now my sink is loaded with dirty dishes that'll probably be ruined by the time I can run the dishwasher. I don't get anymore cash until this weekend, so the water isn't coming back anytime soon. I'm not working at the moment and I don't have wheels anymore either. My bank account is literally drawn down to the 70 cent mark, even if I had transport I couldn't buy anything substantial.   When I asked a neighbor I get along with just to let me fill up a milk jug he told me no instantly. He acted like I was asking him at gun point. So he can borrow my edger, but me asking for a gallon of water is the line, apparently. I don't know what I'm going to do when I inevitably need to flush the toilet. I got a lot of time to come up with creative solutions but food isn't something I can come up with a fix for. I was going to live off spaghetti and macaroni until payday but now I'm stuck with no water to boil them in. I ate an uncooked ramen brick for a meal earlier, if I don't get some real food I think I'll go nuts. I can provide proof if someone needs it, I'll scan the note the left for me or whatever you guys wants. I'm being real here, I'm in a bad way and the end isn't in sight quite yet. Can anyone help me?

t3_vifbg	1340510025.0	Rollout	Rollout	Be nice or go away......	Not a joke.... I have noticed that we are getting an increasing number of folks that are self proclaimed internet police here. Some of these people even create new accounts for the sole purpose of going to peoples posts to make rude comments.  We do not welcome this. We do not want it here.  We agree that some, although few, people take advantage here, and we aim to curb that as much as possible, but the witch hunts do not help, they hurt the community overall.   So, if you think someone is taking advantage, or you suspect foul play, message the mods. We WILL look into it, and deal with it accordingly.  If you are one of the "vigilantes" you will notice your account(s) will be barred from this subreddit. I will be going through and weeding these people out on a daily basis.  It was nice and peaceful in here, with the occasional asshat... We do not need a bunch of them....   Thank you, and please drive through.	1340512747.0

t3_ux7h4	1339466928.0	SuperSizedMe	SuperSized	It's Monday, that means Weigh-Ins are due :)	Ehem I'm down 35lbs :) 5 more pounds to go and I'll be giving away another pie :)  ~~If anyone can find any of my old posts in regards to the contest, i'd <3 you forever and probably buy you a pie for saving me a lot of time and trouble :)~~ Thanks to wieners and 69_so_fine for finding these old posts :) When I get paid this friday, i'll see if can come up with 2 $10 pie cards for ya (assume your both stateside?)    First things first, please go ahead and upvote this post so we can keep this near the top to allow everyone to join.   So I've been giving a pie for every 10 pounds lost, and was curious if anyone else was interesting in joining me or even "sponsoring" me. By that I mean 1 of 2 things.    *  You join me in losing weight, every x pounds lost = you donating a pie.    *  You "sponsor" me. **Every 20 pounds I lose** (or you can simply donate a flat amount), you donate X amount of $ at your discretion to be used to give out pizzas.    *  To those asking how often this could be, my currently weight loss is 30lbs, with this past week being a total of 5.8lbs lost. I still have a long ways to go, and you're welcome to give/not give as you wish.    This is simply my way of possibly putting more food into someone else's weight loss. Even if no one is interested, I'll still be donating for every $10 I lose (budget allowing. In other words, might not be the moment I lose the 10 pounds, but will be the next paycheck afterwards)       **How this will work **     * Weigh Ins will begin on Monday, and go until I hit my goal weight (180 pounds)   *  If you are competing with me, PM me how much you wish to lose, how much you will donate, and at what increments.   *  When it is time to donate, simply reply back to this thread, and or PM me so I can add it to the sheet. [You are more than welcome to make an Offer thread,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/sehvs/offer_lost_52_pounds_in_realsupersizeds_weight/) I only ask that you link this thread in your offer post so others may see it and possibly join alone :)  Comments, ideas, etc please leave below :) This contest will run until I hit my goal weight :)    **Possible Sponsors/Contestants:**   1. TrueBlonde (C)   2. Mittimer (S)   3. Tygerlily   4. Edodes (S)  **Confirmed Contestants/Sponsors:**   1.

My youngest daughter, who is 2, just came down sick this morning (or shall I say at 12 am last night!)...3 of the other kiddos are at VBS, where dinner is being served.

t3_uf2x1	1338522424.0	nicolerhoades		{Request} some help tonight would be great	Hello, my name is Nicole, and I wish I could be here under different circumstances, last month my mother was diagnosed with Leiomyosarcoma it is a form of cancer that is very strong and when diagnosed with it the outcome is usually bad. She had an abdominal hysterectomy and we were hoping that it removed all of the cancer but it has not  Mother went to the Dr. today and we were told it has spread to her lungs and her throat, she goes to a different cancer/radiation specialist on june 7th to begin radiation therapy.  So i don't think this post belongs here and I honestly do not know where to post it, mom is sleeping right now and I am glad for that but I don't know what to do anymore.   I know I am asking so much from strangers out here and you don't know me from a hill of beans but I don't know what to do, my husband is working 2 jobs to help us and my mother and I am on disability for an old hip injury.  So if anyone can help please I would be grateful, please can you perhaps help us find a smaller home for rent in the Sacramento Ca area?  We are renting a 5 bedroom home to also care for my older brother who has Multiple Sclerosis but we can't do this alone anymore and I feel so lost, I am trying to be strong for mother, just like she has been there for us all these years and it is hard.  A smaller home could be even a 3 bedroom, we can make a living room into a sleeping area if need be but I just can't do this by myself and I am afraid of our landlord when he hears we cannot afford this home, I don't know what is going to happen and I am scared.  Thank you for reading this and I am very sorry it is so long but I feel you should know about me before making your decision to help my us all.

t3_soqk1	1335213647.0	yocoltboy		[Tip] Being nice pays off	I just got some real life pizza karma! I gave away the free pizza I would have earned with my Papa John's rewards points last week, in order to kick my habit and start eating healthy. Then I just got a call from my local store thanking me for my positive feedback, and they said they were going to send me a coupon for a free order. He said he gets several complaints a week, and that I'm the only one who gives positive feedback on all my orders. So, if you order pizza, take the time to praise them for what a good job they do, you might get rewarded with a free pizza. =)

I would love to buy someone a $10 Dinner box from Pizza Hut which includes a medium 1 topping pizza, breadsticks/cheesesticks and some cinnastix.  In order to participate:  Have a Pizza Hut in your area.  Be able to pick-up/have delivery available to your home.  Be all right with giving me your address/phone number via PM.  **Thank you picture!**  (It's my first time and I'd be thrilled to see someone smiling and enjoying a slice of pizza.)  **You can only submit ONE guess!** (Sorry I didn't specify that sooner.)

I can't offer the deal to *anyone* who can guess..just *someone*. I'm sorry if that caused any sort of confusion.  I was excited/nervous.  **Edit 2:** WOW.  I didn't think it would be so easy to guess my favorite song cover. :o  But somebody must have known I really dig me some Jesse St. James/Queen.  Congratulations to **bourgeois_smash**.

YAY! sure enough, this one was able to use the gift card so i passed it on to them!  i was looking forward to having papa john's since i haven't in awhile but there are 4 of us, roommates included. since they are helping me deal with no income and late on rent i couldn't just get pizza for me, right? but it's perfect for one person to enjoy!  so i passed on your random gift to another random giver for a random reason (clicked their post cuz it mentioned area near me) and another person is made happy!  isn't that great!

Well enough of that as punishment for trying to leave Dad has ordered that she give some lucky person here that Artisian Pizza. so here are the rules to get said pizza.   1.

She finally left 5 days ago, but cleaned my bank account on the way out. Soooooo... I decide it would be a good idea to get super drunk. 3 facebook posts later about slamming my face into a wall and I get a knock on the door.... its the police, she called them telling them some sob story about me hurting myself. Now I'm finally out of the psyche ward, but I lost my job (I live in an at will employment state), she closed the account and caused my last paycheck to disappear into the ether. Jesus. So... no food blah blah blah you hear this all the time. Somebody gets me a pizza and I'll return the favor when I get my unemployment check. Location is MO, USA. Springfield to be exact :D	True

t3_rzhq7	1333909161.0	A_Mouse_In_Da_House	shroom	Gracias Senor Pasta	Thanks pasta, funded the food for me and April (April and I for the grammar nazis).  Bit of a back story of this awesome specimen of humanity.  So pasta tells me that he's gonna buy me a gift card for pizza on the IRC.  So we're in talks, and he orders one from dominoes.  We wait a couple hours, and nothing happened.  He's been having trouble getting rejected from dominoes so we thought that was the case.    So he throws out another 25 for a pizza hut one, expecting the dominoes to be rejected.  It's after 11 so we know we won't see it til the next day.    Next morning, I wake up, check my email, and lo and behold, two gift cards, $25 each from dominoes and pizza hut.  I let him know, we had a short laugh, and I said I'd be holding a contest to give the other away.  Contest will come later in the week when I'm more creative.  Well, me and April used the dominoes one, and it actually lasted the two of us for 3 meals.  You rock mate.  Much respect.  Signed, Mouse.

I was not expecting it... and now that I have this card and cannot use it since there's literally NO Papa John's in this area... I'm hoping someone here can at least help me out with a $20 Domino's GC since Domino's are scattered all over this area.  All the Papa John's are at least an hour or so away or more.

Those that have treated me and those that have just offered kind words or an upvote. Thank you. Thank you for all the times I may not have said it enough and thank you for making me believe in humanity. Just thank you.  Thank you especially to WorriedGrandma who was kind enough to treat my husband and I to dinner last night and thank you to Pasta for just listening when I felt like no one cared or no one could possibly understand.  I saw the post about people not saying thank you and I have to agree, that's a pretty low thing to do. I think I've always said Thank you, (maybe not through a post, but definitely through PMs) but if I've ever forgotten or just haven't said it enough, I'm saying it now.  Remember Reuben Studdard's: Sorry for 2004? Well change the lyrics around to make this my Thank you for 2012.  I hope everyone has a positive day!

It's unbelievable the kindness and genorosity I see here and while some may say "it's just a pizza," it's more than that. It's the gesture, the time people put in and the fact that people are willing to spend their hard earned money just to help someone out. Sorry I'm all sappy, but seriously, IdTugYourBoat, Shrapnull and mcredson are perfect examples of what it means to be awesomely empathetic, kind and generous. Thanks guys! You are delightful!

t3_rpzs7	1333397160.0	matelt	FAP	Let's give heyOSPB a big round of applause!	Tonight, the gentleredditor and scholar heyOSPB treated me with a pizza, therefore I decided to show you what happened here. [I first introduced Pizza to Dissertation.](http://imgur.com/1Xzst) We had a bit of a chat, laughed, enjoyed ourselves. Then Pizza asked me where she was from.  [So I showed her the very beginning of her existence.](http://imgur.com/gdbpg). But something terrible happened. I noticed Pizza has been sliced by hooligans before she reached me. 'How very brave' I thought, 'she didn't complain a bit' and yet the smell of her warm cheese became more and more appealing. I ended up eating a slice, then two. As tragic as it may seem, this story has actually a happy ending: Pizza's nutrients will fuel my brain who will be able to focus on Dissertation, and heyOSPB now have the satisfaction of giving a pizza to a random person, and a pointless short story to read :)  Again, many thanks, and may the pizza gods bless you and your next 135 generations.

t3_rmmk8	1333217510.0	sundancer2626	shroom	Request Calgary AB, Canada	Hello Reddit world and thank you for your warm hearts in helping family's in need.  This is my first time requesting a pizza for my family. My family has been though a lot of changes in the last few months.  Being unemployed to finding work being kicked out of our home finding a new place to move too then getting laid off. I was the only one working. My husband can’t find work and now I just got laid off. I had the flu started this Sunday so I had to call in sick this week as I was not better till Thursday I was very sick and got a doc note. I called work everyday then on the last day I called was told that because I have not worked there 3 months yet he is letting me go. So the last pay check I got it to pay my rent which I am short on already  as my work shorted my check and this means I cant buy food. It’s been a long time since I been able to afford pizza for my family and this would full our tummy and hearts if someone can help us out. Thank you so much.  	
t3_rmlw2	1333216621.0	four2wenty		California, Hungry college student going through rough times and a never ending growling of the stomach	Im a college student with no money or no way possible of getting it in the next few weeks. I have had 3 small meals( slice of toast, 1 ramen, and 1 sandwich) in the last 5 days. These couple of weeks have just been horrible. I lost my debit card, which is my only access to money. I blame the US BANK employees for neglecting their duties. I tried to check if i had at least a dollar left in my card, but the machine happened to be out of order. As i was complaining to the employee about why there was no sign up, his co worker proceeds to put one up. What infuriated me was that they did not even try to help at all. Before you say something like just call your parents to help, I have already done so. However, they live across the world, 17+ time difference to be exact, so getting my card immediately is out of question. 	
t3_rlqcj	1333153007.0	bitch_puddin	shroom	(Request) Truck problems and pizza.	My fiancé and I bought this beautiful '66 Ford F-350, knowing that we'd have to fix it up a bit....a bit turned into rebuilding the entire engine. We thought we could do it cheap, as my fiancé's dad used to own a garage where he put in many an hour. I even got out there and greasy to help! I learned a lot, but we've spent around $2,000, plus buying the truck (we were walking everywhere, luckily we live in a small town). So to wrap up this entirely too long post, we're broke and hungry, so if someone is willing to help us out, that'd be fantastic!

The catch is - they expire 3/31/12. These are NOT codes that can be used more than once...they were earned from a survey company as a reward in September 2011. Each is valid for one free, one night rental from Blockbuster Express. Not valid on Hot List or Blu-Ray titles (although I think I read they may have changed this, and now it takes $1 off your total, it's worth a shot anyhow!). I can give away 2 codes to 5 different people, or more, depending on how many people respond! Hope someone can use them quick! PM me if interested! :)   Maybe somebody who gets a pizza can have a movie to go with their pizza?! I don't have the means to give a pizza now, but this is a start, right?  X-Posted from RandomActsofKindness & RandomActs  EDIT - ALL CODES HAVE BEEN TAKEN AS OF 12:15 PM EST ON 3/31/12  HOPE EVERYONE ENJOYS THEIR MOVIE!  ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S KINDA FUNNY I GOT 47 UPVOTES & 5 DOWNVOTES (FOR SOME ODD REASON LOL)	True

t3_rirnq	1332994796.0	Bigbaddaboomm		(Request) Tucson, AZ -It's my Friday and my week old, brand new laptop just failed on me, our little family dog at my parents house is sick and getting put down this weekend, feeling depressed.	Hi there, this is my first post on reddit, long time lurker, always checked out RaoP for some inspiration about good people doing good things. I'm not starving, I have some decent food in the fridge, but I would really love some pizza. Pizza is my #1 favorite food, and I usually order some as comfort food. I'm just completely out of money till next friday.  First, I get an email this morning from my step mom that our little dog has kidney disease which is why shes been sick a lot lately. Vet gave her a shot of something to see if she could keep food down, but it didn't work, so shes going to be put down. Then I get home today and boot up my new laptop, its wonderful I saved for 6 months to pay for it, I can play every game that's out on ultra settings and have great FPS. After about 20 mins of playing some Skyrim it just shuts off, won't turn on. Hours of tech support online/calling ASUS, I find i have to send it in for repairs/replacement and won't get it back for up to 2-3 weeks. On my old computer now reading reddit and feeling bad. Shitty day. So if anyone would like to send me a pick me up, I would love you forever.

t3_rdks6	1332728715.0	DEStudent	PIF	OFFER- Gift Card Up for Grabs!	Hi all: I don't get to offer nearly as often as I would like so I'm here to make you an offer you shouldn't refuse: I'm willing to give out a GC to someone but this will take some creativity. Here are the rules: 1. Account must be at least 1 month old and you must have history in other subreddits. 2. Show me something positive about Muslims- A Muslim saved someone's life, a Muslim man walking with his family... (This can be a story available online or a picture or even something in real life) 3. What's my favorite pizza and pizza topping?  If you can do the above, you will be entered into a chance to win pizza. I have the ultimate choice in who wins, so no whining!  That's it. Have a great day!   **EDIT** **And the winner is: Trenzor** Although no one got everything correct, I can appreciate that this person was kind enough to go through my history and see that I was struggling with Statistics and offered to help!**  Now for all you that are wondering: **My favorite pizza is a white pizza. Not with Alfrado sauce, I mean a nice simple olive oil topped pie with mozzarella and maybe some feta or ricotta cheese. Favorite topping- is pineapple!**  **But I do love Pizza Hut's crust! So if I was eating from there, Red onions and pineapple... I'm making myself hungry! Good night all and thanks for playing** 	True

t3_rcz7c	1332701811.0	carmageddon		Trolling	Part of the reason why I created a new account is because I just knew deep down somehow, someway some very disgusting person out there would find it funny to troll me or other people. Do I deserve pizza more so than anyone else out there who made a request? Absolutely not and that is not the issue. If you're going to dissect my post, take parts of it and throw it back in my face ...I mean it's really not appreciated. I don't think anyone here deserves to be trolled. Getting the guts to even make my post to begin with was hard enough.   Yes I'm going through a hard time, no I won't always be in this position, but yes a little respect or just kindness DOES help. I am leaving this post up as a reminder that there is a real person sitting behind a keyboard, looking at their monitor and that they do have feelings. Not being able to afford good food and surviving on canned vegetables and boxed/packaged food isn't something I'm proud of. It's depressing and embarrassing but you know what, tomorrow I will not leave that job interview without a job. And when I have that job, I'll come back here and find someone who may be in a similar situation and help them as best as I can.   Compassion and kindness go a long way. Good bye random acts of pizza and thank you for the opportunity.

She was recently diagnosed with brain cancer about a month ago, and she had her first chemo treatment on March 16th. Her next treatment is March 30th. Her husband works full time, and has to take off work for treatments and doctor appointments, as she is unable to drive now. This weekend she has her 2 adorable grandbabies with her. This morning she passed out while folding clothes in front of her grandchildren. Now she has a horrible pounding headache :(  I would love to surprise them with dinner this evening, so it is one less worry off of her today. She is my best friend, and I hate to see her hurt. I'd love it if I could surprise her with a couple of pizzas, breadsticks, and a bottle of soda. Its only 4 of them :)  If anyone could help me, I'd greatly appreciate it. I have no problem with verification either. Thanks so much!!  EDIT - Just wanted to say that I just found out this evening that my friend had her hair cut really short, so it is easier for her to take care...and she donated her hair to Locks of Love :(     She really deserves something...she is one of a kind, and I love her to pieces!  IF ANYONE COULD WOULD LIKE TO HELP, ITS ONLY THE 2 OF THEM TONIGHT - AND IT'S THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE HER 2ND TREATMENT. SHE WENT TO THE NEUROLOGIST TODAY AND THEY SAY HER SEIZURES ARE GETTING WORSE, AND THE TUMOR COULD BE GROWING. HER HUSBAND WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT ON PRIVATE PROPERTY (HIS WORK'S PARKING LOT) TWO DAYS AGO, AND NOW FED-EX (THE ONE WHO HIT HIM) SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY BECAUSE IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY.

t3_r7cvs	1332365553.0	DammitChris	PIF	Is it just me, or do people without flair get largely ignored?	I'm not meaning to complain, I've only posted here once. But scrolling through I see a whole lot of requests. And maybe I'm looking at the wrong times, but it seems like the only people that even get comments are the ones that have flair.. I understand the logic behind this, but you can't get flair if you don't get a pizza or send one, right? If I had money I'd love to buy pizza for people, and I'm sure the other people would as well if they were in a better place. Maybe my concerns aren't warranted, it was just something I was thinking about. I love this subreddit and what it does, I just hope people that really need it (Not me, don't think this is a plea or a request) don't get ignored because they had never completed a transaction before.  Edit: I appreciate the thoughtful replies and not burning me at the stake for giving an opinion. I love you guys :D	True

t3_r4k7g	1332214152.0	PodentOros		(Request) I could really use ANYTHING to eat right now.	So, it's been pretty hard lately. My mom was laid off from her job as a teachers aid. There's canned stuff but we ate all the feasible stuff and now only have stuff like pureed carrots. The pizza wouldn't actually be for me, I'll survive, but I would really like something to brighten up my sisters day. My mother told her she didn't have to go to school today because she knew she may not be able to concentrate that much but my sister , who is 9 was like eff that and had cream corn for breakfast and went anyway. She is trying so hard not to be sad because she doesn't want to make my mom feel bad. She even offered to sell(pawn) her Nintendo DS to pay the water bill that came today. But my mom promised we wouldnt do that anymore...thanks to anyone who wants to help!  Edit: In GA

So this will likely be one of my last posts on here, but I need help and I want to help someone eat. Here's the situation:  I am an adult student and I am in a Statistics class. What's the big deal you ask? I haven't had any type of math classes in almost 12 years and when I did- Guess what?!?! I wasn't doing Statistics! I am horrible at math and I am really struggling here but I need this class to graduate. If you can help me, I will make it worth your while. I will give you a Gift Card to the place of your choice (Pizza Hut, Papa John's or Domino's or even walmart if you trust me) but: This may not happen until Tuesday at the latest. If you trust me, and can prove that you are trust worthy, we can make a deal. I may get the Gift Card sooner, but Tuesday is the latest. I need help with this by Midnight EST **TONIGHT**. Can you help me?  Here's the Assignments:  Chapter 2 in your text provides instructions on how to produce a pie graph, bar graph, and frequency polygon.  For this post, group the 20 data points that you developed in your Week One discussion into 5 groups.  The way that you group the data is up to you. Once you have established your groups, use Excel to graph the data as a pie graph, bar graph, and frequency polygon.  Additionally, follow the directions in Chapter 2 for calculating skew and kurtosis in your data.  Attach the graphs and results to your discussion post.  In your opinion, which of these graphs was most useful in representing your data and why?  What did the results tell you regarding the skew or kurtosis in your population?  Did one of the graphs illustrate the skew or kurtosis better than the others  Second Discussion: Chapter 3 of your text introduces the standard normal distribution. When comparing data from different distributions, what is the benefit of transforming data from these distributions to conform to the standard distribution? What role do z-scores play in this transformation of data from multiple distributions to the standard normal distribution? What is the relationship between z-scores and percentages? In your opinion, does one do a better job of representing the proportion of the area under the standard curve?  **PM ME and I will provide you my data and/or the book we are using.**  This is BIG time. If you can help me, you will be rewarded for your knowledge. If you can't, words of encouragement are also welcome and may earn you a pizza.   **ENDING THIS CONTEST in about half an hour**	True

He has had everything from strep throat (3x), ear infections (3x), sinus infection, pink eye, and the flu. He has now had vomiting and diarrhea and intermittent fevers since January. He has had several blood tests and labs done and we're hopefully getting the results back tomorrow. He has been tested from everything from food allergies and parasites to some pretty serious diseases. As of yesterday he has been feeling a bit better and is feeling up to eating something other than soup. I told him a while ago that once he was feeling better he could have whatever he wanted. Well, my little man has chosen pizza and unfortunately I just don't have the funds to do this right now.

Download [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)  2. See the person who you are getting pizza for and tag their username. (Or even do it by setting a color for their username!)  3. Use that tag to make sure the PM's line up.   4. ???  5. Pizza. (For the correct person!)

I am here today asking for another meal as I am still hurt and unable to work due to a skin infection and the surgery that followed.  I had lost all the skin on my neck 2cm deep, minus a small middle patch saved because the doctors were worried about me loosing range of motion on my neck. Any way, I will post links to pictures at the bottom of this thread, and I warn you;  these pictures are VERY GRAPHIC.  I am broke due to paying for the medicines needed; although the doctors bills were free. All 100 grand of them.   So, I ask; can I please get a pizza? I don't need a huge large or anything, but to eat some decent food that is not cheap noodles or peanut butter.  Warning DO NOT CLICK THIS LINK IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH GORE OR /r/WTF TYPE THINGS. http://imgur.com/a/vmmDk I know I said I would update the album every three days, but the doctors stopped letting me take pictures of the wounds as I have a wound vacuum, and can only see them when the doctors take it off.

t3_qot4e	1331296495.0	Archany		College kid, kinda got fucked out of my last paycheck. [Lincoln, Nebraska]	A few months ago I got a speeding ticket, no big deal, 15 miles over the limit at two in the morning with no one on the highway, I figured it was just shitty luck. Got a $200 ticket, also, no big deal. I get paid monthly here, and I work sporting events so I don't have a lot of opportunities to put in hours, but I came out with about $300 last month. My mom told me she'd take the money out of my account and work it out, because I left for college a thousand miles away from where I got the ticket.  I thought the matter was over.  I got a call from my mother yesterday informing me that, because I hadn't paid the ticket, a warrant for my arrest had been issued. What the fuck, right? Turns out my mom completely forgot about the ticket, and what was a $200 ticket became a $650 charge to get the warrant removed. I put my entire paycheck from last month towards it, roughly $400 (it was a good month), but I still have $38 left towards it before I can drive again, and I have literally a matter of cents in my account. My mother is going to pay off the rest of it and send me money on wednesday when she gets paid, but that leaves me five days without food. HOWEVER. And this is where you guys come in, A large pizza could stretch me those five days.  I've heard you guys do amazing things, and as soon as I get my next paycheck I will return the karmic balance by buying someone else a pizza, but I'm struggling right now.  EDIT: Sorry for getting back to you guys late, I haven't gotten to a computer since Friday. My dad, who I don't talk to very often, ended up calling me Friday night telling me that he heard my mom had fucked me over and offered to put a bit of money in my account. Thank you guys for the offers so much though.	True

I'm not trying to bullshit you guys like all of these people who "havent had a full meal in a week" or "Their paycheck comes in two days." It's rare a paycheck will come on a day other than friday. If anyone can donate me a pizza that would be excellent. I have $20 left to last me the rest of the week and realistically that's also going to buy bud. If you've ever been in this situation before you'll feel the need to help someone out of an all-to-common situation.

I had posted this a little bit more than a month ago:   http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/oi9ln/request_multiple_past_giver_i_will_return_pies/  Glinda_Da_Good_Witch was kind enough to grant me the pizza. Unfortunately, my paycheck the next week was WAY less than I thought, so I was unable to give back the following week.   So, I am paying back now, WITH INTEREST!!   I have granted 3 pizza cards already (darthsean19, captpiggard, and hihi44) and have offered 2 more to Canadians, but if I cannot give to Canada, then I will gladly give to 2 more people.   EDIT: I am able to give to Canadians, so I have granted 2 more gift cards to sketchydeal and meonhere.   I wish I could give more out and literally, Give out ALL the Pizza Pies!!, but alas, the budget for tonight has been used up.  When I say I'm going to pay it forward, dammit, I pay it forward!!

t3_qkc1l	1331053093.0	DEStudent	PIF	A Big Ol THANK YOU and a Request from Delaware	Hey all:  I hope you are doing well and that your day is starting out right. I want to tell you all about a Redditor that did something really special for me and my husband. Not only does he deserve a Big Thank you, you all **NEED** to know what he did.  Since I joined reddit over the summer, this person has been very special. When others were busy calling being cruel and mean, this person listened with kindness and compassion. This person helped me out a few times with pizza and was even forgiving when I made a very serious mistake. I've been having real problems with my stepson.   We know all teenagers act out, but thanks to my stepson, we're essentially on a 1st name basis with the police and 2 caseworkers from DYFS (Dept of Youth Family Services). Things have been so bad that this kid has even gotten physical. So this redditor would listen whenever I would send a random PM just to vent or to cry.   Last week I PM'd this redditor to tell him about the recent chaos and before I knew it, this special soul was sending me a GC in the mail to some place my husband and I really like to eat, but don't get a chance to often because money has been extremely tight. So wouldn't you know, the trouble started up yesterday and like a mirage in the desert, I checked my mail and TA-DA!!!! My GC was there. After my husband had such a rough day, helping save someone's life, the GC was just what we needed. After a day like that, you don't just want canned soup. You want a meal! And thanks to **PASTAFARIANTWIT** that's what we had last night! A really good meal and were even able to leave a nice tip for our server.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!   So since the drama continues, my husband and I went to bed with nice full bellies and were in a good sleep when at 1:30 in the morning, I awake to hear the doorbell and loud knocking at our front door. I wake up my poor husband who has to get up at 3:30am and trouble walks back into the apartment in the form of a 17 year old escorted by the police. Yes, the one that ran away last week and has been house hopping. UGH! So that's how our day started.  Now, I'm definitely not trying to be greedy, but I would really love some Pizza. It's been a rough start and what leftovers I did have, magically got eaten... So that's my request if it's not to greedy: allow me to indulge in some comfort pizza. Also, Let Pasta know just how special he truly is. He's a great guy and deserves a lot more than given.  **TL: PastafarianTwit is AMAZING and Great! And I would like to indulge again today in some pizza**

t3_qfmyn	1330756485.0	woofiegrrl	FAP	Two questions: Icons, and ordering to Japan	Hey folks!  Longtime RAOP reader, gave once, got some questions.  1. What is the new (X) icon?  It's not in the field guide.  2. Has anybody ever given pizza to somebody in Japan, and how did that work out?  I ask because I just moved to Tokyo, and there is both a Pizza Hut and a Domino's not far from my apartment, so I'm wondering if requesting a pizza might someday be possible.  (Not now, I'm not hungry for pizza yet, just someday, when I am craving it!)

EDIT - This was the email I got.  >Dan - Please forgive me.  I am mortified.  I JUST discovered the segment is not airing today. Long story short, I am still at Harpo, but I'm working on "Oprah's Lifeclass" now so I am on a different project but I have been constantly monitoring the calendar and I figured that there was no turning back since that was still the plan last night. (I've been watching, asking, staying on top of this diligently!) My apologies and I will update you the moment I hear anything.  ...

t3_q9wdr	1330449830.0	Kubowski	shroom	Ocala, FL My best friend of five years, my cat Random, has passed away.	He was a wonderful cat. I hadn't really wanted pets again, but an ex girlfriend of mine talked me into taking him.  she had several cats, but he was the least social. I sat in the grass behind her house and played with him with a leaf. Later on she told me it was the first time he had ever played, and even by himself he never batted things around like the other cats.  I lived alone for most of the time I had him, and he saw me through some hard times. He was a vocal cat, and would always whine at the door when I left, and when I came home he acted like a dog and jumped up on my leg. He followed me everywhere, and if I left the room he waited at the door for me.  He collapsed a little while after I had him, and I skipped the rent that month to pay the $500+ vet bill.  He was crazy about me, and I loved him to death. He slept in my bed, he ate from my plate, he is the only cat I ever had that liked sweets and he would even eat pizza like a human if I held it sideways for him.  I'm not sure how to handle this, and I've got some homemade wine here and I could use some solid food.  Pizza is a comfort food for me and I am certainly an emotional eater.  The only place that delivers here is Dominos.  In the meantime, I'll just go on about what a great guy he was for a while in the comments.

Well I have a request: I would really like to just relax and indulge in some pizza. Yes, I've received, but I've also given. My neighbor actually got the trade I completed the other day.  My husband has bronchitis and was so kind to pass a sinus infection off to me. It's been a while since I held a contest, but as soon as my FinAid comes in, I want to do a nice big one.   Is there anyone willing to treat me again? I know it's a long shot but it doesn't hurt to ask.   I appreciate all of you whether or not I receive pizza.

t3_q7psa	1330319502.0	ismelllaliar	pizza	RAOP, we need to talk about user Bigolenastyfish	This is obviously a throwaway account but I had to get this off my chest.  User Bigolenastyfish is scamming the RAOP community, and just admitted to creating multiple accounts to try and get pizzas.   [The video in which he admits to creating multiple accounts for free pizza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&v=US1Ukat6n7U#t=84s)  Now I usually wouldn't give a shit, but after looking at [his account](http://www.reddit.com/user/Bigolenastyfish), I had to stand up and say something.  He got 2 pizza's from the Papa John's 100 gift code giveaway, and then a $40 Domino's gift card.  I love this community, I've given many pizzas to this community, but after hearing his shitty YouTube commentary about the pizza's he received, but never thanked the kind-hearted givers pisses me off to no end.  He would rather thank God and the fact that he will always provide.  Anyway, it's late and I'm a little drunk, but I just had to get that off my chest.  I know it's RANDOM acts of pizza, as I know someone will be a bitch and post, but still.	True

t3_q5d1a	1330169388.0	DEStudent	PIF	Would like to trade if possible in Delaware (USA)	Hey there Everyone: Well some of you may remember a little while ago I posted a rant about my local dominos and having to wait two hours. Well I called Customer Service because the manager never even called to apologize. Well customer service apologized and said they were sending out a gift card. And I got it... and I want to send it back. The night they took 2 hours to send my dinner, I spent $30. For all the headache they caused, they sent me a $10 gift card. Now part of me is like WTF?!?! Especially since when I give out pizzas on here, I try to keep it at at least $15+ and I've spent a decent amount with Doms. But after this, I am done. I like Dominos but their service leaves a lot to be desired. So here's what I would like to do: trade someone a $10 Dominos card for a Papa John's or Pizza Hut gift card.   I've had a really rough week with my stepson (PM me if you want the details of that) and after my husband and I paid rent and electric, we're broke again. I really wanted to go see Good Deeds tonight, but money isn't right for that. I figure we can at least have pizza one night and just relax at home.  If you are willing to trade, please let me know and have a verification code and a decent history. I'm not interested in trading with someone that will try to scam me.  TL: Dominos near me is awful, want to trade a $10 gift card for Papa Johns or Pizza Hut. Want to go see a new movie but since hubby and I are broke, pizza at home watching Swamp People re-runs seems like the best alternative.  THANK YOU and please excuse my lengthy post. It's just been one of those weeks.  Sincerely: DEStudent

From r/cancer: http://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/py0wq/hi_rcancer_got_my_mum_admitted_today_for_a_stem/  Feeling really lonely today and can't be arsed to cook. My dog has had his meal, so he's good. Anyone want to buy me a pizza? I live in India, so I don't think any of the coupons will work. The pizza I want costs about 15 USD, Paypal will do (if it's not a problem for you guys).  Cheers RAOP.

In his honor, I am offering (10) $15 gift cards to those redditors that post an interesting fact about "tug boats and/or tug boat captains."  Unfortunately, only being an expert on potions and witches, I will have to defer to the dear Tuggy himself to inform me which 10 submissions he felt deserved za.  So, google away, dears, and let the contest begin.   It will end Sunday night as soon as Tuggy PMs me with the names of the winners!   EDIT:  THE WINNERS ARE AS FOLLOWS: ridethewild HenniferHlopez WrongWayKid apesnandroids menmybabies ghOstwOLF Smil3zG Laeylyn hadenandlexysmommy DownSouthDread  Please PM me and I will get your codes to you as quickly as Cashstar allows <3	True
t3_q3hn7	1330051663.0	Talwyn	PIF	[Offer/Contest]  Gimme your pets for Pizza!	I got a Pizza in the RAOP V-day giveaway, and am now getting around to paying it forward!  And also celebrating that my awesome Seasonal/Temp job turned into Full-Time/Still Awesome Job.  So, here's the deal.  I work at home (yup, found one of the legit work-from-home jobs), and my "co-worker" is Chihuahua who likes to cuddle while I work.  I want to see YOUR "co-workers" in their work attire!  Whether that be a tie, a bow, or anything, really.  Photo-shopped entries will also be accepted.  Also, if you don't have a pet, stuffed animals and pet rocks will also be accepted.  If you have one of those, then an obviously made-up story of how awesomely they help you during the work day is needed.  :)  I'll choose a winner (or two, haven't decided yet) by 12 PM CST tomorrow to receive an e-gift card from either Papa John's, Dominoes, or Pizza Hut.  No idea how I'm going to choose, but this should be fun!  Now gimme your pets for Pizza!  Mwahahahahaha! :D  EDIT: Okay, so contest is closed as of 12:15 PM CST. It looks like my evil plan to get tons of cute animal pictures worked.  The downside is now I have to choose.  Gah.  I forgot to schedule my lunch break from work accordingly, so in about another hour, I'll PM the winners to ask them their choice of e-gift card.  I'm thinking there will be 3 $10 gift-card winners.  :)  I shall let you know soon!  EDIT 2: Winners have been notified... A little late, but better than never!  Winners were birthday_grunt, for their awesome pet rock, jesst for her ferrets, and bobbybusche for her awesome laser-eyed flying puppy.  Thanks for playing, and I enjoyed all the animal pics!  I might do this again some time.  :D	True

Hi, All:  Well, it's true, I AM terribly hungry, but I've got a "hot" date with the Tin Man later who has promised to treat me to a lovely dinner tonight.  But now that I've got your attention, I TRULY am in need, and figured this is as good as time as any to call in any favors I'm owed!! I am calling on all you good people out there who have offered many a time in the past to send me a pizza (and whom I have turned down) to use those monies INSTEAD towards helping send a Mod on RAOP, namely, CAYUCOSKID, to South America this summer where he is volunteering for Habitat for Humanity. And, lol, I have "conveniently" copied and pasted his donation page in the body of this text:  http://share.habitat.org/argentinaongteam20122   So, kindly, I ask you fellow RAOPians, please, please, if you have a few extra dollars this week, please, please, donate to CayucosKid so he can volunteer and help out some needy families and make this world a better place.  And for all those who do NOT have credit cards, please, please, PM me and I will give you my Paypal addy or home address.  Let's all back this worthwhile cause and come together as a group.   Oh, and if you want, I can and will provide a verification code.  And for our dear, Ms. AlliOops, please and thank you :)    Edit:      [–]snang 2 points 5 minutes ago     His team partner is still in need of assistance.  Now that TugYourBoat ruined the donating fun for CayucosKid  (See below in Snang's comment thread for partner's donation page!)	True

I don't like asking for things (hence me using a side account), but my mom and I could really use some food. I haven't been able to find a job, and she works ultra hard, but w/o child support we can't even pay rent. I think the only thing we have to eat is some canned pineapples. If you want proof I'm an active redditor and not just a beggar, I'll send a screen shot of me logged into my real account or w/e. I just don't want my friends to know about my situation.

t3_q2x4z	1330026244.0	powerbearden	shroom	(Request) Denver, CO - Unemployed, struggling guy trying to get a warm meal	So I've fallen on some really hard times, and I've never done something like this, but after reading through some of the posts on here, I was taken aback at the kindness of the community, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  I'm a 24 year old guy, living with two roommates that I absolutely loathe, unemployed for the past 5 months, busting my back looking for a job, and reaching the end of both my money and sanity.  I've been "borrowing" food from my roommates for a couple weeks now, but I hate having to go to them for anything, so I've been relegated to ramen and pickles.  If you've never tried them together, do yourself a favor and DON'T.  So, if someone had the urge and would be willing to help me out, if even for a day, I would be incredibly grateful and appreciative.  Thanks everyone

It's a family tradition (with homemade cake and just our family of 7), and would love to continue it. I requested in Oct for my 3 of my children's birthdays (10/4, and 2 on 10/31) and recieved a gift card for each birthday. I'll provide whatever verification you need, including a copy of the birth certificate (which will block out any REALLY personal info). It's been tough lately, and 4 of my 5 children just started public school this past week (they had been homeschooled for years, but it got to be too much!) and I really want to reward them for such a good job, while celebrating Joey's birthday! Thanks so much!  *EDIT - PLEASE CHECK OUT MY HISTORY FROM REDDIT HERE : http://www.sdorm.org/redditgivers/ I HAVE RECIEVED VARIOUS ITEMS (CLOTHING, BABY ITEMS, ETC) OVER THE PAST 5-7 YEARS FROM WISHUPONAHERO AS WELL.

A friend told me to come here because I have a $25 Barnes & Noble gift card but I'm really hungry so I wanted to trade it.   If you have given before (I see the sidebar says there are icons for that so I can tell,) I will give you the card number and PIN, you can check the balance online and then send an eGgift Card to Dominos' for $20 to the email I give you. So you know that it has funds and is valid. It's an eGift Card, but Barnes & NOble says you can use it at their store too.  And if you have not given, it's the same thing but you have to have soemone who has given vouch for you.  Thank you, Matthew

I want to say a huge THANK YOU! to everyone who has been so thoughtful today. Momma MonkeyHouse's surgery went great and I've already gotten her back home and in [bed.](http://i.imgur.com/wzzfz.jpg)  B. Momma MonkeyHouse was so kind as to give this baby MonkeyHouse a little $$  (realistically though, I owe her a million dollars for being my mom!) :0) So, you know the drill! Make sure you've commented - or PMed me - and in a few hours I will be sending either a Dominos or Pizza Hut e-gift card (your choice) to a lucky RAOPer!  ______________________________________ I know there are other subreddits probably more relevant but because I am an active RAOPer I was hoping for your help.  Today, I'm hanging out in the hospital while my mom gets surgery for probably the 15th time in relation to cancer. I was hoping you all would be willing to leave Momma Monkeyhouse some cheerful comments.  She knows that I like to give pizza to "internet strangers" and I think it would be neat to show her how supportive those strangers could be.   Thanks you guys :0) 	True

So today I want to help someone who is basically my exact opposite in interests, political affiliation, ethics, morality, religious beliefs, etc.  Basically if you're FOR many of the things that I'm personally, morally and ethically against, you have a good chance of winning!  If any of the following describe you, you get points! Here's the list:  * Currently registered as Republican: **10 points** * Against gay marriage: **10 points** * Think atheists are going to hell: **10 points** * Don't give a damn about the welfare of animals: **10 points** * Against immigration: **10 points** * Against abortion: **10 points** * Think Obama is ruining America: **10 points** * Think the Muslims, gays and/or atheists are going to take over America: **10 points** * Plan on voting for Newt Gingrich or Rick Santorum: **10 points** * Been convicted of at least one felony: **20 points** * You think the recent Simpsons episodes are as funny now as they were in seasons 2-9: **10 points**  **No need to elaborate or specify which items you scored points on.** Just announce your points in the comments. I trust that you will be honest about this.  Also to play, you must be a redditor for at least 6 months with 1000+ karma so I can look up your comment history.  I reserve the right to make the final decision if I decide that the top winner(s) aren't legit.  Winner announced tomorrow at 12:00 noon Pacific time.  *EDIT: Please don't get into any debates.*  FINAL EDIT: 11:47 am right now. Going to call it since there are no new recent posts.

t3_pymvb	1329787624.0	zpgjne	pizza-gold	[Question] Has anyone else been getting spammed by Dominos/Cashstar?	I'm hoping I could get some help here. After using the Dominos e-gift card service to send a pizza, I started getting e-mails from dominosegiftcardsupport@cashstar.com.  The e-mail stated that a support case was being opened for me even though I hadn't reported anything. Being the naive person that I am, and thinking that someone at cashstar made a mistake, I clicked on the link to look at my 'support case'.   Now, I'm continuing to receive these e-mails, and my main e-mail is sending out spam e-mails to people that aren't even in my contacts. I tried googling to see if others were having trouble with this and it doesn't seem like that is the case.  I could really use some advice on how to proceed, this has never happened to me before and i'm not sure of the extent of damage that could be caused by this mistake. 	True

Single dad here, just lost my job, have a 13 year old who lives alone with me. Not completely broke. can pay rent and bills this month, but thats about it. Gonna be alot of spaghetti for the next month though since in Florida you cant apply for unemployment and food stamps until you've been out of work for two weeks, then it takes 2 weeks to get them. We wont starve but my boys birthday is this Friday and plans have been canceled. Was gonna take him for pizza and to see Star Wars 3D, Cable and internet canceled, have about 2 weeks left on this months paid bills. Not asking for Star Wars, My boy is awesome and completely understands. He is so amazing that he said he doesnt care if he gets anything, he's just happy that he lives with me now (just got custody 6 months ago) I feel like an ass even asking for this. If I'm a dick for asking for pizza please tell me nicely, I'm already pretty bummed.

Thank you RAOP and pastafariantwit, Kon-chezz, and overripebanana for pitching in and getting me a $25 gift card and to raspberryseltzer for making a post on my behalf.  For those who don't know (which is probably all of you) i lost my cat last Monday.  I had her almost 16 years and what was overnight I find out she's sick, very sick, and that I had to put her down.  It was so much to take in and the vet visit and the eventual bill of putting her to sleep left me in quite a bind financially and especially emotionally.  I'm still not dealing well with the loss of my faithful companion and today being one week, i'm still struggling.  I decided to use the coupon today and got me some pizza and it's certainly a bell filler and reminds me that there is some good out there.  Thank you Raspberryseltzer for making the post that got it all started.  It takes compassion to say "Hey, this guy needs help" and being proactive about it.  Thank you as well to Kon-chezz and pastafarianTwit for working it all out.  I think Overripebanana was even in on the co-ordinating of it so thanks to you too.  If not, then just thanks for all that you do on this subreddit.  I really appreciate the love that poured out from you guys when i really was feeling as bad as I have ever felt.  It's made things a lot better. I don't know if it's inappropriate but I want to take this opportunity to thank alliterativegenius over at /r/dvdcollection too who sent me some snacks/treats and a $25 dollar gift card to Amazon.  It's great that there are communities here that really look out for others.  I've always felt like family there and we have a small community but it's a great one.  So please, if you can, check it out.  It's for DVD Collecting buffs who like to talk about collecting and show off their collections.  Like we say "It's not the size that matters, it's how many people you show it to".  NOW ON TO THE PICTURES!

I had a couple free large pizzas for Papa John's because when I ordered with the gift card from our friendly neighborhood jetboy, the pizzas weren't very pleasant.  I called about it, and they gave me a couple free pizzas.    Fast forward to today, the neighbor upstairs was going to walk a mile and a half to McDonald's with his 2 year old daughter.  It's kinda cold, and that's a long walk for a two year old.  I offered him one of the pizzas and he accepted :).  I am happy that it went to someone that needed it.  I've been trying to figure out a way to give it to someone locally, but I couldn't figure it out.  Life figured it out for me!

Here is a screenshot of the game. http://i.imgur.com/cjGIO.png  It is a puzzle game of match 3. With a few different modes of gameplay. Time Attack, Marathon, and Endless.  I have been working on this game full time for about a month so far. I am low on funds and have been eating raman for most of my meals. A pizza would be nice.	
t3_pw353	1329625331.0	Fuhdawin		University student, unemployed, broke, and have under $20 bucks in my bank account. Not asking for a handout, but a pizza would definitely cheer me up. 	Been on anti-depressants because I still cannot find work in my area. My mom won't give me any money because she would rather spend it on herself instead of my college education. She used to have $25,000 saved up to finance my university, but now she's spent it on the mortgage/expenses.   She won't give me a dime.   I'm on my last straw and been living off ramen noodles for the past month. If any redditors can help me out with a pizza, it would definitely make my day. This is real and couldn't be anymore serious. Reddit, I've come to you to help out because I don't know what to do at this point.   Thank You.

I'm willing to draw for my dinner though so if you have a request I'm more than willing, a few rules though: I won't do porn, sorry. And I don't really want to do furries. But other then that I'm pretty cool with whatever else Here's a sample of the style you'll get it in:  http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpeul65nlQ1qmyot1o1_500.jpg http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvneukp38b1qmyot1o1_500.jpg  Thanks a million!

Requirements: AT least 12 days as a reditor--I was new once not too long ago!! I will order the pie and pre tip the driver, so winner will have to provide info to me. (Sorry not yet sure how to do the e-card thingy and have heard the first time can be a bit of a snafu) Need to be verified per Raop preferences.  Now for the contest---hmmmm------thinking a few laughs are in order-- so how about an embarrassing moment in your life, ie I took a lady who I cared for to the bank, she always wore sundresses and slide on shoes. Being one of those save the good stuff for a special time, her unmentionables were rather worn!! As she completed her transaction and we were walking to the exit her granny panties which were on their last thread of elastic fell down. Not missing a beat she stepped over them and calmly told me to just keep on walking as another customer gasped and tried to get her attention. I was mortified because I too banked at that branch and most people thought she was my mother!!! So ready set go..... I will pick a winner by 545pm Texas time!!!  USA only as I have no clue how to order out of country but I will get that figured out also in the future--heard that is also tricky!!   EDIT:: wow this has been some fun reading--and a tough choice, but because I was reminded of my then 6 year old sons letting out a loud and long fart at midnight mass on Christmas eve, cracking all of the congregation up for over 5 minutes,I chuckled now at the memory and at ThirdEyedea joke telling and farting saga.  PM me with your info and thank you all for sharing your stories!!!	True

t3_ptgsr	1329454853.0	menmybabies	menmy	RAoP LOVE AND THANKS!!!!	This post goes out to everyone who was a part of making Valentines Day the best fucking one ever for so many of us.  Holidays in general suck for me but, *these* ones sting.  This year, that sting was replaced with warm and tingly zings through my whole body.  The laughs, the smiles, the generosity, the caring....it was fucking priceless!!!!      To everyone who contributed, I thank you all.  People often say "what the hell, it's just a pizza" I tend to think either these people don't think about it or just don't get it.  It is so much more than a fucking pizza!!!  To know someone out there, over the internet wanted to do something nice for a random stranger...well, that's an awesome fucking thing.      I've been really lucky to be able to call a lot of you friends.  Thank you for that.  Aside from being back in the work force, my adult interaction was way limited...like non-existant outside of my neighbors.  I've had many great conversations, laughs, sad times, fun times and have shared them with amazing fucking people.  People who in real life, I would be gawd damned proud to introduce them as My Friend....you know who you guys/gals are.  You all hold a special place in my heart.      I want to thank you all for the help that's been given, the friendships that have been formed and shared.  The support and concern extended. Thank you for giving me a virtual family I am accepted in and proud to be a part of, something I lacked prior.  Most of all, I thank you for being who you are.  I am glad that my path has crossed with you guys, it has made my world a better and brighter place.  For that, I thank you from my core.

[International Ordering Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ns3dj/the_definitive_guide_to_ordering_internationally/) is what I was after.  ---  I'm attempting to order a pizza from outside of America but they all seem to want to see the card used to pay for the pizza on delivery. Is there any way to get around this (I'm in Australia).  The gift cards all want a billing ZIP code too and a state which of course won't work for me.

t3_pt9v6	1329445674.0	calyx13	PIF	Screw you brown rice syrup	So this is a dumb post...but my son is 4. He has autism and because of that he will only eat a few types of food (and they always have to be the same brand/type/box/etc.)   Anyways - one of his "staple" foods is Clif Bar, Z-Bars. Now today there is news that organic brown rice syrup has unsafe high levels of arsenic. Fan-frigging-tastic, that is the 2nd ingredient in Clif Bars.   I e-mailed them but I imagine they are inundated with e-mails right now. So until I know for sure, I'm holding off on dispensing these, much to L's dismay...  I just bought a 12 pack of these fuckers for my boy tonight. I don't have any extra cash. If someone could sport us a pizza (from Pizza Hut, if at all possible because g-d knows my son won't eat any other type) I would be so very grateful.

[Here's a few of them that I have done](http://i.imgur.com/Vxgjh.png).  Thought this might be a good way to do a few.  Here's how this works:  1.  Make a request in the comments here with a link to your subreddit. 2.  **Wait for me to respond**.  I might not be able to do all the requests I get, so wait for me to respond to your request. 3.  Donate a pizza to someone who really needs it.  [Check the /r/random_acts_of_pizza new queue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/new) 4.  Send verification to me.  A screenshot of the order confirmation page will do. 5.  I make your logo!  I'm not the best artist in the world, so no guarantees, but [my past work](http://i.imgur.com/Vxgjh.png) shows what I can do.  I haven't done this before, so I'm hoping it goes well and helps feed some hungry redditors.  I'll try to keep the offer going for a few days, but I work during the day, so I'll be active at night.

t3_pr2y6	1329333767.0	shaynagier	shroom	Thank You for Making Valentine's Day Awesome- to all that gave!	Hey RAoP,   So i know that RobSpewack helped me by giving my baby sister some pzza goodness, and I can't thank you enough for that. Pizza Hut was a bit of a pain, and like me my sister doesn't like ordering on the phone, so I ordered for her and she really enjoyed the extra treat. :-D  Now I know, personally, that people on RAoP go above and beyond everyday and give generously so that others can have pizza. Perhaps the most well-known is JetboyTerp giving away 40 dollars everyweek with the Singularity contest- and the awesome Superbowl Giveaway as well.   Also Pastafarian who has helped me out on multiple occasions as my life gets suckier and suckier circumstancially.   And to BadBrownie, who also has provided a pizza pie for me and hubby before...   Basically, thank you everyone for making not only my Valentine's Day (and hubby's/baby sisters) but for each and every person and couple that recieved a pizza yesterday- that was truly awesome of you and I know that whether they say it or not they are all incredibly grateful- though they should totally let you know!  I had no idea that I was going to get a pizza as well, I thought I'd given mine up so that my baby sister could have some, but then some totally awesome person went and replied to my hubby's post providing us with pizza too! Sadly, I don't recall WHO provided the pizza, but I wanted to say thank you and I greatly appreciate it anyways, so I decided to thank you all because truly, you are all wonderful and while one of you provided us with the pizza, it could have been, and at times in the past or future, it was each and every one of you- so thank you so much!  I regret to say that we have no pics. Hubby started eating it long before I thought to get the camera out. It was very delicious though!

t3_ppuqz	1329262531.0	evilrick	FAP	Thank you jetboyterp!	Hi!  I wanted to make good on my promise, and while I can't post pictures, I can tell you about my wifey's reaction!  I found out last night (before I ordered the pizza!) that there had been a change of plans and we wouldn't have company tonight.  I changed my tactics to suit the change in plans, and waited til tonight to order the pizza.  When the knock came at the door, she was confused.  We had sold an old TV on Craigslist, but that happened 20 mins before.  When she heard the delivery guy's voice, she turned to me and her eyes narrowed in suspicion.  She asked me what I did, and I told her "RAOP was very kind to us."  She is currently letting pizza digest while under a warm, just out of the dryer blanket and watching TV while I post this and silently pat myself on the back.  Thank you jetboy, without your kindness, I wouldn't have been able to provide a nice yummy dinner for the love of my life.  You are awesome.  Please don't stop being you.  Ever.  That goes for the rest of RAOP, as well.  Whether in a relationship new or old, or lamenting your /foreveralone status, I think you are awesome!  Hopefully in the next 3-4 weeks I will hold a little contest to give away a gift card or two!

t3_pompx	1329193963.0	DEStudent	PIF	RANT against Domino's	Hey there RAOP:  So check this insanity out: On Thursday, I was hungry and had a lot of homework plus I had a brownie meeting earlier in the evening. So I ordered Domino's online. I placed my order at 9:29pm. So I was using the tracker and everything sounded looked okay, until I noticed they were taking a long time to get my order in the oven... Well my computer froze up and I needed to re-start. So about 10:30pm I called the store to ask if everything was okay and what was taking so long. The new store owner answered and said he got 7 other orders when mine came in, but mine was on the way. I said okay and tried to be patient. When I got my computer back up in running, to my surprise, the tracker said my pizza had already been delivered and it hoped I was enjoying it.... No! If I had the pizza, I wouldn't have been trying to study in hunger. So 11:10pm comes in, and still no food. I called the store again and the owner brushed me off saying- Oh it's right around the corner. At 11:22pm is when I finally received my order. The driver rang the bell, offered no apologies and simply said sign here (paid using my card). Now, I had a $5 bill that I would have given the driver had he at least apologized, told me it wasn't his fault, anything... He barely spoke. And for the first time in my life, I gave a $1.00 tip. I have worked food service and I know things happen but the driver was rude and so was the store owner. I emailed Domino's and they said wait the 3 days and see if I was contacted by the store. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and no call. No email, no apology, no refund or even discount. I called Customer Service today and they apologized and said they were sending out a Gift Card and they apologized and also said they were forwarding my complaint to the Franchise Area Manager. Domino's was okay, but after this, I'm ready to be done with them. At least at this location. Has anyone else gone through anything like this?

t3_pn63t	1329115064.0	PastafarianTwit	FSM	Announcing the first Annual RAOP V-Day Giveaway! (Details inside)	So today we're announcing the great [RAoP](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza) Valentine's giveaway.  On Valentine's Day, 2/14, we're planning a massive gift card giveaway.  We know that some redditors are foreveralone, so we'd like to try and brighten up your otherwise depressing Valentine's holiday.  I don't have the exact numbers, but we've definitely got over $1000 lined up for sure.  This is going to be MASSIVE, friends.  **The Details:**  If you are interested in throwing some money into the pot for donations, please PM me (PastafarianTwit) and I can fill you in the details and put you through to the official coordinator, should that be necessary. Keep in mind I'm employed full-time and a full-time grad student, I might be slow to respond, but I WILL respond. Should you wish to sign up for a pizza, we plan on putting up the post for entry on Valentine's morning.  This post is NOT the post to reply to if you want a pizza, this is just to give people ample notification because it's going to be HUGE and we want as many people involved as possible, givers and receivers alike.  Also, I'm hoping that a few more redditors get inspired by what we're doing and decide to pitch in. =)  Unfortunately, this rules out all of you non-US individuals, as these gift cards are US only (sorry, but when you're sending out this many gift cards, you want to make it as easy as possible.)  International people are always welcome on RAoP, however.  These gift cards will be in amounts of $10 for singles and $20 for couples. (If you're a couple requesting $20, we ask that you post a picture of both of you holding a sign with the date and time [Hell, maybe this is a good way to find a Valentine, eh?])  **Testimonials**  "Due to a garbled interstellar space transmission we have a surplus of pizza gift cards. They're absolutely no use to use in the space future! So, we're just giving them away!"  -DownSouthDread (he's high right now)  "Valentine's Day is one of those days where life is either great or crappy.  It's either a reminder of what love you do have, or the love you don't.  After having donated my first few pizzas on RAoP, I realized how much doing one little thing can make such an impact on someone who feels like life isn't going their way.  It wasn't hard to think of a day where more people might feel that way than any other. After seeing all of the other great people on RAoP who donate when they can, I realized that Valentine's Day was the perfect time to get all of the donators together for a huge event the likes of which RAoP hadn't seen."  -RobSpewack  "It's all good"  -chupanibre25  "Valentine's Day is supposed to be a day of love and friendship, but for many it can royally suck.  It's my hope that some of the pizzas I gift today will help ease some of that...well...suckiness!"  -tanyagal2  "pizza is awesome."  -snang  "You don't need a reason to help someone"  -moshimoochi  "Shut up and eat some pizza."  -PastafarianTwit  "To donate makes for a great feeling of peace and having that knowledge you've brightened someone's day up. For Valentine's Day, this is one of the greatest days where one can feel better with a gift, for those who're alone or are couples. This day's also a day of remembering those you love that have passed on. Keep the flame burning, everyone. May the Gods and Goddesses keep you safe on your Path."  -KeiroD  " .............did somebody say pizza?"  -overripebanana	True

PastafarianTwit originally called me out for having an against-the-rules post for pizza, but he ends up being the one to feed me!  How cool is that?!?  Instead of getting pizza (I know, how **DARE** I), I decided to buy things I've never bought from Domino's before.  The [cheesy bread](http://tinypic.com/r/nqu7nq/5) seemed normal enough, but then the [chicken parm sandwich](http://tinypic.com/r/2ps2c13/5), one that I was looking forward to, seemed like some weird plastic mold of cheese and death.  But I tried a bite of it, and it's all good!  And then finally, I had to include an [angry food-grubbing pic](http://tinypic.com/r/2cog13r/5) of myself holding coke and something mysterious in the box!  (Hint, it's written on the box.)

t3_p81bq	1328208948.0	PastafarianTwit	FSM	[Announcement/Reminder] Verification system and google are your friends!	One of our generous donors managed to bring to our attention some guy we had been suspicious of and came up with some actual proof.  The individual in question has used 5 different nicknames on RAoP posting almost exclusively for pizza.  This donor managed to figure out something was suspicious by googling the email address and then messaging us when something looked fishy.    Remember, google and our verification system can be very helpful if you're at all suspicious of someone.  If anything looks off, please message us for advice and we'll handle the best we can behind the scenes with you!  =)

I just want to say that the one time I have received pizza off of here, has been one of the things that really has been a high point in the past few months.  I like to think that by the few people I have purchased pizza for feel the same way.

Have a great day everyone.

I sold my car, my bike, all my electronics (save my phone and laptop to contact potential employers) and the majority of my clothing so that I could get food. I don't have a social card nor do I have a valid ID so I can't get EBT. I am in the negative on both of my bank accounts.   Needless to say times are extremely tough. I hate asking for handouts and I wouldn't be doing this if it weren't my last resort. Someone helped me out not to long ago on this subreddit and damn near saved my life and I repaid the favor shortly after. I feel hopeless and Im literally BEGGING for help. I don't have much to give but I will return the favor. Please help me.

t3_p3g2i	1327955188.0	AndyVale		UK Pizza?	Evening,  I think I asked this a few months back but I'm wondering if anything has changed. Are there any pizza chains that do email vouchers the same as the US ones do? At the moment it seems that the only way you can do it is if the other person gives you their address. Understandably, not everyone is totally okay with that.  Anyway, just wondering if anyone knew of a way to do it in the UK.

Being *really* new to RAOP, reading the side bar, and reading the website, i'm confused:  There is so much focus on verification code, but no one mentions it in there posts.  Example:  I just read the latest 3 requests, but no country was mentioned, no verification code mentioned... here I am thinking "Yeah, I'll send a pizza to a random, how cool, maybe I will request one one day" but how? I don't know who they are, where they are, and no verification code.   Couldn't people simply state which fucking country and state they are in?  Also, it really looks like a fucking complicated method of simply giving someone a pizza.

t3_ozluy	1327697471.0	justaboy	shroom	A thank you, an apology, an a promise	So, right around Christmas I found out about this subreddit, and made a request with a promise to return the favor once I got reemployed/back on my feet financially, and was given Pizza by the combined efforts of XandaPanda and IgorCherfal; thanks again guys! Not long thereafter, Jetboyterp gave me ANOTHER one, just for being *close* in a random competition he held - so this is the** thank you** part! Thanks to those three, and to everyone who makes RAoP possible, you're all amazing.  The **apology** comes because, a month down the line, I'm still unemployed, and still haven't been able to return the favor; I'll be moving soon because I can't afford rent, and bringing my job hunt to a city with better prospects (I love my town, but if I'm going to be effectively homeless and unemployed, I figure it's smarter to do it somewhere with a better chance of changing that; besides, there is no chance for advancement in my field (culinary) in a town this size, whereas in the city I'll be able to work in a 'real' kitchen). What this ads up to is that not only have I not given pizza yet, but I don't see it happening anywhere near as soon as I'd like, and that's the apology.  The **promise** part is that I do stand by my word, eventually, and as I see it, I owe this community 4 pizzas - one for each of the people who helped me (or gifted in their name, if they prefer, I'll figure that out when I get there ;) and one just cause I really want to give pizza (If delivery places took foodstamps man... ;).   Anyhow, just felt like putting that out there. No more requests, because I've already received a ton (though I'll probably keep entering on random offers, or non-need based competitions, because hey, pizza is awesome...), and it looks like I won't be able to Offer for a while, but I wanted to make a post to all of you saying: Stay Awesome (you're pretty good at it).   **tl;dr Thanks for pizza earlier; sorry I can't give pizza now, I promise that I will give pizza later. Pizza.**

t3_oyzm0	1327660415.0	kristekitty		YAY JETBOYTERP AND RAOP!	sorry it took me extra day jbt, but like i've been saying the internet is pretty bad here! i've been trying but only now managed to get on and hopefully i can post this before it runs away again!  when i made my post, i really didn't think pizza would come of it. i was hoping that my raop friends would jump in with some kind words about how things would get better. my goodness did i underestimate the good people of reddit!   jetboyterp sent me a pizza card. i was able to get enough pizza for me and my roommates, who haven't had pizza in a long time. it was nice to be able to treat them as thank you for letting me use their bath stuff! even my piggie puggle was happy because she got to share the crust. you really made it a great night when it started out so sad!  and that's not all reddit did for me. before night was through i'd received several offers to send me bath samples, girl needs and other things i need but can't afford. one poster said he would order me dog food for my bitchy baby and even a trashy novel to read in the tub. and many people came forward with advice on how to try to earn some money, get a job, go back to school, and things of that nature to help me care for myself. and all that isn't even counting all the folks that stepped up to tell me they think i'm neat and good stuff will happen soon!   i came here pretty darn sad. i posted here because i adore so many of the people here and wanted to hear from them that i'd be okay. what i got from you all was so far beyond what i'd hoped for! thank you all so much for making me feel a little more hope then i've been feeling! and i promise as soon as i can get a little better internet, i WILL be back to cheer for all the good that's here!  i adore you all!  thank you jetboyterp!   thank you raop!

Anyway I'm trying to prove him wrong and any help would be appreciated-- I'm looking for ideas or anything to actually prove him wrong.

t3_owtds	1327536562.0	ThisUsernameSucks		Extremely low on funds, been hungry since the semester ended	*Forgot to add (request), also I live in Louisiana, near new New Orleans  A little background on my situation:  I'm a nineteen year old college student who has a to take a semester or two off to pay for college.  I'm currently living in my parents old house (they literally left nothing here to eat, I couldn't find a job in the couple weeks I've been in town) just to move everything out (I have to travel across the country in two days to move back with them).  In the past month, I have had my mp3 player stolen out of my car, someone had broken into my house and stole my ps3 and my laptop (posting this from an old one) and my car broke down leaving me with no form of transportation.  In other words, I could really use a pizza right now.	True

t3_owq98	1327532721.0	Tattoosfade	shroom	College kid hitting the wall	Well thanks to some justifiably zealous attempts to assuage some of the deficit that Illinois is struggling with right now, I've found myself minus a grant I was expecting to receive for the Spring semester at NIU.  Would have been nice if they'd informed me more than two weeks before the semester started.  Anywho, I decided to soldier on and work on finishing my degree in a timely fashion by taking up a second job to cover the gap left by the lack of a grant.  Come next month's paychecks and tuition payment, things will have stabilized, but at the moment I'm left with 3 dollars in my bank account, an empty kitchen, and no discernible way of coming up with funds for food for the next week and a half.  Any redditors out there feeling generous and willing to help me come up with some form of dinner just for this evening?  Having one less thing to worry about would be a lifesaver.

Work has been cutting back hours consistently, my wife has had some medical problems we've been working through and trying to pay off some old school debts.  We've been essentially wiped out, and it's getting to the point where I don't know where our next meal is coming from.  The local church has been extremely helpful, but I'd love to be able to give them a break for a night or two, maybe with the generosity of someone on here.  I know it's a lot to ask, and I know there are dozens of people looking for the same thing, but I would be immensely and forever grateful if someone would be willing and able to help us out.

t3_ovbz4	1327454223.0	mycatdidthis		I'm having a REALLY rough month. Help?	Hey Reddit, I need help.   On the first of this month my cat got super sick, so I took her to an emergency vet. She's better now, but it put a dent in things. A few days after that, the furnace in my house went out. Normally I'd tough it out, but that entire week it was -10 (30 degrees inside the house). Once again, unless I wanted to wait another 4 days, I had to get an emergency technician to come out and fix it.   I could have rolled with this for a bit, and it would have been tight, but no problem. Until I got T-boned by some crazy lady. Due to insurance being awesome, I was forced to pay for a rental car for two weeks. Great news though! They'll reimburse me sometime in the next 2-3 weeks. Meanwhile, my bank account is in the red, and every card I have is overdrawn.  I'm starving, and I just spent my last 10 dollars on gas so I can get to work.  Help?

t3_ouwkj	1327436019.0	kristekitty		(request moreno valley, ca) because becoming a grown up sucks!	argh. i'd heard about empty nest syndrome but at 42? it's been almost a month since my third and youngest went to stay with his dad so that i could rent a room from high school friend and get job and place of my own. and i can say from experience being a mom was easier then being an independent woman! what's worse then not finding a job yet is that i couldn't go back to school this semester. not only do i not have permanent address, but even less money for transportation. i don't know if i'm more mad or sad about having to put school off YET AGAIN!  and as i sat outside trying to catch free wifi long enough to put in more job applications, i went back and forth on if i should even request. i've been given so much and there are so many requests, i'm not expecting much. and that's okay. because i figure just putting the request up will bring out my buddies to tell me that things will get better soon! and that's the most important thing i need right now, cuz i'm feeling really overwhelmed...  so any advice and/or cyberlove is appreciated! i'm broke, have no transportation, and have to rely on my roommate for basics. i've thought of selling blood, any other ideas on how to care for myself? send them my way please!  thank you all for listening!

t3_onova	1327002194.0	haleigh321		{request} Girls group home is requesting pizza for dinner.. Please see details!!	Hi my name is Haleigh. I am a volunteer with a girls group home in Coral Springs, FL. (Several Mods are aware of our home from previous verifications, however further verification can be provided upon request) The new year has brought several changes to our home. Most notably we have 2 girls who are aging out and will be leaving us. Aging out is very hard for the children who are placed in foster care and group homes because they are considered to be to old (18) to be eligible for further assistance from the state of Florida. The girls who are placed with us are here for different reasons. (Orphaned, Runaways, Or taken from their families with cases pending in family court.) As a volunteer, I try and help them as much as possilbe to make a smooth transition. We rely solely on donations, and do not always have the means to provide take out or delivery meals for the girls. I would like to provide a nice pizza dinner for the group home with the girls who are aging out as the guests of honor. I am asking the reddit community to please help us by donating a few pizza's to our home. We have a total of 9 girls living with us.

My heart has been broken and I have decided to leave Reddit land and RAOP  :( I wish it didn't have to come to this but, It has been brought to our attention that someone who shall remain nameless is out in reddit land trashing our reputation. Saying all sorts of mean things about my loyal subjects and how we NEVER EVER give pizzas away and that no one has ever gotten anything from us, well let me set the flickin flackin record straight we always give pizzas away when we have contests. NEVER EVER have we not given them away we may have had to wait a few days to a week or so when our bank was pissy cause we bought to many gift cards at once. But we always give them away. I just wanted to clear the air and let everyone know we aren't trolls or liars at all. And just to prove another point that someone thought Me and Loyal Subject Mom were one person I am going to post our lovely mug shots so you can all see that we are 2 different people, I Da_Queen am the cutest one Mom is just Mom in her glasses and my twin if I were 40 and in College :)    Mom Dad and I have so much fun holding contests and giving away pizzas even my bratty brother loves to read and help us think of new contests to post. My Brother saw me crying and gave me a big hug and said it would be ok, it wont be ok because I am so upset that someone would say such awful things about ME a 14 year pizza giver what did I do to deseve to be called names? This name calling is so childish I wish the person responsible would act like an ADULT and get over it, but alas I doubt that is gonna happen so I will take the high road and leave with my head held high knowing that I did a good thing and that sometimes it can take one bad apple to ruin a basket of apples. with that I bid my farewell you guys are the greatest and I so enjoyed my time here it was fun and I loved all the contests entries I got you guys are so silly and I am glad that I got to spend time here now I am off to the wonderful world of 9th grade :)   http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v340/K_A_M/?action=view&current=us.jpg    Thanks for reading :) now back to your regularly scheduled program of Cheesy Goodness (> (> (> (> (> pizza for everyone 	True

I've given and received but it's been a while since I gave only because I am a FT student. (not because I'm greedy or stingy).   Thank you!

t3_okpk2	1326797017.0	user24	pizza	In need of a hot meal?	Find a soup kitchen / food pantry near you:  USA: http://foodpantries.org/  Or Google for [soup kitchen CITYNAME] or [food pantry CITYNAME] (eg [soup kitchen Lincoln])  I've seen lots of people on RAoP saying they haven't eaten for a few days, don't know where the next meal is coming from, are in unreliable housing situations etc. One random pizza isn't going to help you much.  Help is out there. You at least have internet access.  I guarantee there is a local charity or group who can help you get fed, clothed, housed and back on your feet.  You can also find help by going to your nearest church and asking the pastor there (but remember that you don't have to have God in order to be Good).  There is no shame in asking for help, in fact it's a sign of great maturity.  Good luck people.  Please post other useful links here.

You guys are freaking awesome to say the least.  I am in college and am about to go into debt just so I can buy textbooks (never will I understand why books cost so dang much...). Now I am not about to hide any information from you all like I have seen some people do on here. I could go to the school cafeteria for some dinner, but I always end up eating french fries and ice cream because their cooking is...sub-par to say the least. I am about to go crazy if I have to eat more french fries and ice cream for dinner again.  So, I figured I would come on here and ask if anyone would be willing to help me out!

We just don't have the funds for it right now. We have been eating dry beans and food bank food. Pizza would be such a blessing right now, and the answer to both of our prayers! We are praying someone can help us in our time of need, and provide cheesy, meaty, saucy nourishment. Our food stamps come in in a few days and we can make a pizza or two last until then.

I've requested a couple of times with no result, but that doesn't mean I haven't benefited. I'm going through a really tough time right now, and am being continually astounded at how heartless some people can be, but every time I come into this forum and see people giving total strangers pizzas for no reason other than they *can*, it gives me hope.   I know it sounds silly, but with my dad in the hospital and a new baby to take care of, the little lifts of hope I've gotten from reading the fulfilled requests on this forum have at times been the one thing that kept me from just breaking down and crying. So... thanks.   tl;dr: You all rock.

Anyway, the time has come for me to make a post.  I just moved into a small new flat with my Mum, after my brother died recently and she couldn't afford to keep paying the mortgage for our old house. Everything is pretty much still in boxes and all the cupboards are empty, so my Mum has been leaving me money or a sandwich from Tesco or something to keep me going. We had an argument last night because she was drunk and she promised she would stop drinking, and when I woke up this morning she hadn't left any money or food, so I have nothing to eat all day long. I have no money (the wallet was a figure of speech - I don't have a wallet!) at all, not even £1 to go and get something cheap from Tesco. I woke up early this morning due to being hungry.  I am embarrassed to post on here so I hope I haven't done this in vain, someone please help me out. Thank you in advance.  P.S. I'm in the UK

t3_ob2yn	1326219044.0	nastypoker		Request for pizza - Hungry,  no food, long day	Found out I might lose my job in the next few months. No money till pay day.   Today has been awful and I could really do with a pizza. As I mentioned in the "be nice to each other for pizza thread", I will be giving away a pizza when I get paid at the end of the month.   Would be awesome if someone out there could help me in my hours of need.   Thanks

t3_oaxi3	1326211288.0	DEStudent	PIF	Just a Little Short in New Castle, DE	Hey all: **I'm just a little short of being able to treat myself to some Cheesy Goodness from Pizza Hut. I have a gift card that has enough to buy a $10 pizza, but: 1. I don't have my car to go pick it up 2. If I had it delivered, there's a delivery charge, plus I have nothing for a tip.**   So I was wondering: does anyone have an odd balance left on a pizza hut card so that I can order some lunch? I am not feeling well- sinus problems and my IBS is flaring up so eating the chili I made for dinner last night isn't an option right now.  If anyone wants to help, shoot me a PM. Of course I'll pay it forward. I've given and received and plan to hold a contest of my own in about a month with my school stipend.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!	
t3_oatag	1326203720.0	dcmband03		(Request) Dinner for tonight...My job has let me down  a bunch and it is just the beginning of the week :(	So I was notified yesterday that I probably will not receive my paycheck on time this pay period because our person who turns in our time forgot to do it an now we have to suffer. I have $65 in my checking and I pay $40 a week in gas alone. I was also just notified by my boss yesterday that the position that they were going to have created for me in December fell through. I was promised by the VP that I would have a position in December with them.... instead of being hourly with no benefits. I wish they would have told me sooner he led me to believe it would be ok...now I have no health insurance, no dental, no vision, nothing...I am completely upset, depressed, angry, just so let down and am now back to square one applying for other positions...it just sucks...I just would like something tonight....Thanks for listening ROAP just the fact that you read this means something...Thank You

t3_oaklg	1326179709.0	OmNomdePlum		{Request} Home & Half Pay - Penniless on the Hard 	Hello, Pizza Gods? Are you there? It's me, OmNomdePlum.  I am but a humble tall ship sailor, which as you well know, in this day in age means I've taken vows of voluntary poverty. Teaching children how to sail an 18th century ship is well and good - however there's a point where one realizes that it's not paying the bills.   So, having recently returned from life on the high seas, I find myself working my arse off to pay the sudden onslaught of bills that I've returned to, which leaves little for food stuffs. I've applied for work at the Seattle Art Museum (they have some awesome exhibitions coming in), but should I get this job, I won't see positive pay off well into next month.   Thus, Pizza Gods.. here I am, a sailor with a roof, but no nom'ibles. Please, if it is within your power to do so, send me a sign - an omen of good will that will get me through the night, and hopefully tomorrow - I'll find out if I get that job tomorrow or not.  In the name of the Godfather, the Caesar & the long lost, but not forgotten Domino mascot, I pray.   Amen.

I have sorta of a strange request.  I need someone to gift a pizza or gift card or just an e-hug to one of my reddit friends.  [My friend](http://www.reddit.com/user/RageAgainstTheRobots) has been having a bit of a rough time lately. Dude was mugged couple month ago, and compiled with just other general life stuff.  I met him a year ago on reddit, although his current account is newer he has always kept me up with me generally kept in touch.  I can vouch for this guy, he's legit.  Now, he surprised me with Reddit Gold today [/shameless plug]. I know dude is saving for his own place and stuff so I know he's going to need every dollar he can save.   RAOP, can you gift my friend a pizza? Since he's in Canada, and I'm a bit on the lazy side today, so I thought I would gift a pizza to someone in the US for this exchange!   TL;DR: Give my friend a pizza in Canada, and I'll gift a pizza here in the United States. International Coordinated Pizza Giveaway!	True

t3_o7buc	1325982490.0	MikesKitiKat		I don't need pizza, I need hay.	I was laid off last month and I'm still not back to work. I have a horse farm that usually pays for itself during the Spring, Summer and Fall. Unfortunately, the horses can't graze once the grass stops growing in the winter (or if too much snow on it). This requires us to supplement with hay and grain. In our current financial situation this is tough. We've even tried selling one of the horses, but there just isn't a market. Anyone out there that can help feed the animals?    Edit: Sorry for the delay in posting pics. I was having trouble getting the file size adjusted so it would post to IMGUR. Ended up having to print screen to paint to create a small enough file. These are our boys, Tockey, Tyler and Trapped. Trapped was a rescue. We had to put over 500#s on him last year. He was a winning Derby horse that the owner left in the field to waste away. He was brought to us by the Large Animal Society of PA. Here is the link to our boys: http://i.imgur.com/fXpmC.jpg	True

t3_o33qy	1325716938.0	gatorfan12		(Request)My family and I could use a pizza.. please !	I use food stamps, and we ran out of them this month because of Christmas dinner. My fiance gets paid tomorrow, but tonight we don't have anything to eat. I have three small children too. One pizza would probably be enough, We would really appreciate it. Thank you and God bless.	
t3_o33at	1325716368.0	sammy_boy	shroom	Thank You Jetboyterp!!!!	A few days ago, Jetboyterp gifted me a generous egift card to dominos! It took 2 trips to the parlor with my girlfriend to exhaust it all! Thank you Jetboyterp, you are a wonderful human being!

t3_o2x82	1325708691.0	Epicon3	PIF	(Offer) After a horrible experience, I'm done with Dominos.  Info Inside-	So, I'm hungry as a mofo getting ready for work.  Think to myself, "Oh yeah [Jetboy](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp) hooked you up with a dominos gift card a few days ago.. there is still some $$ left on there".     Long story short- Dominos online is hating me today.  Called the store to try and place the order and got the opposite of support.  Verbatim quote, "Sucks to be you.  To bad.  I don't feel like dealing with this."   So - Here are two gift cards I have.   One has like $0.50 on it, the other has like $4.00.   RAoP, do what you will with them.    6006492637001063861  Pin- 4948 6006492637001032114  Pin- 7338   and, Thanks again to [Jetboyterp](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp)! 	
t3_o2l8p	1325692356.0	gregntasha	shroom	REQUEST Philadelphia 	Hello RAOP:). Just thought a pizza sounded great for my kids. My son is turning 2 today and I thought the kids would like some pizza.

t3_o2fyk	1325681078.0	annellase		:) Many many thanks to tanyagal2!	Tanyagal2 has definitely renewed my faith in humanity, after generously treating me to dinner last night. I had made a request a few days ago where I was PM-ed by two people. After providing a verification code and  my email address, my inbox was flooded with all types of spam. When I said that no giftcard arrived, this person then tried to get me to go to a site that ended in .exe. It really made me questioned what I could be possibly opening myself up to here, but I realize that people like this exist all over the internet and to just be more aware in the future. Still, it was pretty underhanded to offer to help when they had no intention of doing so.  I love what this site is all about: Helping, supporting, encouraging, warm, open...I will definitely be back to give when I can. Tanyagal2 will hopefully be receiving all the karmic goodness that will come there way. Thank you.	
t3_o2e85	1325675644.0	Celestial92		Knowledge = Pizza	I will give the first person to answer these 5 questions (correctly...lol RR) enough money for a pizza of their choosing. Since I study science, this is what the questions are about.  Let the fun begin.  1. Action/Reaction is part of these laws.  2. A star creates light (energy) on this principle.   3. Where would I find a quasar?  4. Base pairs in DNA are made up for these four letters (not literally)  5. Most economies of the western world have a central bank that practices.. this (FRB is abbreviation)  For an extra pizza, my roommate has suggested that someone tells a 'Yo, mama so fat....' joke to make us laugh.

He is an active member and an awesome moderator.  His days are full of work, school and life in general but, he always makes time to keep things great here at RAoP.  He is fair, kind, funny, cunning, respectable and admirable.   There is a nomination taking place [right here for best mod of the year](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bestof2011/comments/o19v7/nominate_moderator_of_the_year)  if you feel how I feel about PastafarianTwit click on the link and upvote the hell out the comment/comments where he is nominated.     Twit has given a lot of himself and his wallet/bank account this year.  Let's show him some love and appreciation for his hard work and dedication.   Twit, I know you will see this.  All I can say to you my friend is regardless if you are the top pick or not, you will always be number one in my book.  Lots of love my dear friend! :)   HAPPY NEW YEAR RAoP    **EDIT: You guys, the most upvoted comment on there right now is over 1000+ upvotes for the science sub mods.

t3_o1vcx	1325641181.0	thetruthispain	shroom	Be careful..	It's amazing that so many people that have truly just found this subreddit are ignored, trolled, or harassed. I have no problem with people asking for verification. By all means, if you're spending your money on me you should know that my bank account TRULY is overdrawn, or whatever the case may be.The issue I have is people who are reaching out to newer people just to get information from us.   Someone seemed nice, and like they genuinely cared about helping me. They asked for a verification code, said a card was coming. My email has been flooded by over 100 odd emails ranging from viagra, adultfriendfinder, and so on. I have never received a piece of spam to this personal email account, as I hardly use it. It's interesting that no giftcard arrived, and my email account is now useless. Why continue using it if I have to sift through crap now?  Please don't be stupid like me. In the same way older users don't trust newer users, don't accept help from someone who has NEVER given before/doesn't seem too active here despite their account age/or is asking for sensitive information. I realized I was being had when I told them I never received the card. They then sent me a funky looking link and told me to go to it and fill out the form. I didn't do it, the link ended in a .exe.   Be careful	
t3_o1tuu	1325639046.0	BrrrrrrItsColdUpHere		(Request): Bought too many cool fishes for my tank today. Will trade photo of fish for pizza!  	I want pizza, and I bought some cool fish to restock my tank after a power outage left all my fishies dead.   Anyways I'll send you a cool photo of my fishies if you'll send me a pizza :)  Edit: I'm in ny, but I just want dominos. Also, I am a waitress and I just don't work until tomorrow... 	
t3_o1sh0	1325637106.0	anthonytake2		(Request) Had a rough day, could use something substantial to eat. Riverdale, Georgia	I posted on here yesterday about how my bike got stolen. To put it shortly it means I have to walk to work from now until I can afford to replace it. Well I made the walk today and it was a lot rougher than I thought. I ended up getting to work late and being scolded in front of a bunch of customers on top of everything else. So tomorrow I'll be getting up even earlier to make the trek, right now my legs feel like they're going to fall off.  It's been in the twenties all day here today and it's going to be like that for the foreseeable future. Not fun to walk in for hours, much less before and then again after working for eight hours. If anyone could throw some pizza my family's way it'd really be great.

I'm sure he won't mind sharing the ailment he is suffering from for all those who PM him.  Happy New Year to all. :)	Lets have another great year on RAOP!

Very kind and easy going! **Upclick this user: ThisIsImpossibraaaah** I won't divulge private info, but let's just say he/she deserves some BIG THANKS!!!	
t3_o0t4y	1325571991.0	Spiritdad	PIF	A big thank you to all RAOP'ers.	When the holidays seemed bleakest for me, you folk with your random acts helped pull me through and gave me hope in humanity after all. I appoligize if I don't thank each and everyone of the people who offered as I started out to, but my laptop was stolen today, so I'll pop in every once in a while and say a big thanks to everyone when I have access, or I get my laptop back.

t3_o0jew	1325556602.0	zakattak26		(REQUEST) St. Louis Missouri. Unemployed and could use a slice	The Wednesday before Christmas I was fired from my job.  I previously worked for major corporations and moved to an independent computer repair company because I thought it would be a better opportunity.  After my first two weeks I noticed that some less than ethical and legal things were happening.  I saw the companies 40 + year old head tech go through a teenage girls picture file because he thought she was attractive and also the company wasn't following labor laws.  I raised a concerns because I could have been held liable for some of the issues that were happening.  A few days later I was fired, the reason was "You don't fit in with our company".  I'm looking for another job and until then repairing computers for friends, but a random act of pizza would defiantly help restore my faith in humanity.  I know my account is new, but I can easily give you proof that I am legit.  I suppose in the long run I may not have a job, but I do have my ethics.  	
t3_o04p0	1325535586.0	Yarrg	PIF	Requesting food	I've given a few times but never received.  I just moved back into the residence halls today and don't have any food.

And yes, the Jets are the only team I'll accept.  If you post, say, a NE Patriots logo, I will use your pic on my dart board :P	
t3_nylck	1325429791.0	menehan	shroom	{Request} Bringing in the new year without a good meal	I was invited to Reddit after playing checkers on Yahoo. I told the person that I was playing that I was craving a pizza, but didn't have any money to buy one. They suggested that I try my luck here. I've been eating rice and beans for about a week and while I shouldn't complain, it is getting old. A nice Hawaiian pizza would be more than enough for the wife and I. Something different to lift our spirits. Happy New Years from North Carolina!

Most of the college students are probably still at their folks' home, reveling in the food that they didn't actually have to buy themselves, and alternating between sleeping, eating, and using the remote. But they should be preparing to return to school, where Pizza is one of the basic food groups. To assist in their preparations, I offer my 20th weekly offer to a college student. Your name must be submitted by today (Friday) at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings time), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have heard a Christmas tune at some point in your life.  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ------------------------ **The winner (drawn out of a NEW coffee cup, because I was using the old stained one for tea) was JordanHansen13. I've sent him/her/them a gift certificate for $20 to Domino's. ** Happy Friday, everybody!  	True

t3_nt46j	1325042791.0	DEStudent	PIF	Request in Delaware **PLEASE READ**	Hey there: So I hope everyone is well. Well I've been with Reddit for about 5 months. People have helped me and I hope I've helped some others. I was reviewing the messages I sent to people when I had a pizza give away contest... So I was wondering if any of the people I helped, are able to treat me to pizza and coke. I'm not crying the blues. And I'm not recounting favors. Any help I gave was a blessing and not by my own hands.   Some of you may be sick of seeing me here. Some of you know you've been helped by me and I never told a soul. (I only mention that because some people said oh, well your history only shows you giving away 2 or 3 pizzas...when in actuality it's been more than that.)   We do have food, so I'm not starving. I do have IBS and let's just say the tortilla soup I made isn't agree with me.  I would love some nice warm pizza and an ice cold Coke.  Is there anyone who is willing and able to help? Anyone willing to vouch for my credibility?  I have requested and I have given. Have a good day ya'll!  	
t3_nt0bx	1325036680.0	prophaniti		Please, help me make my good friend's shitty week and shittier night a little brighter. (Syracuse NY Airport)	So, I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but it was the closest I could find. My friend works way too much right now and the holiday season has been killing her. She worked 12 hour shifts on both Christmas eve, and Christmas itself. Its looking like she will be doing the same on new years night. She hasn't even really gotten to see her boyfriend in a week or more. She had to visit him at his work just to exchange gifts. Earlier on facebook she expressed a desire for a simple cup of coffee that didn't suck to help her make it through the night.  Now, I am in texas  for the holidays, so I cant make this happen myself. I haven spent the last two hours online, trying to find a delivery place that would bring her coffee to no avail.  If there is some kind redditor out there who can bring this poor girl a cup of joe and a slice of pie, not only would it absolutely make her night, but I would be more than willing to reimburse you for gas and food, plus a hefty tip. Please, Reddit. Help me make someone's life just a little brighter this holiday.   	
t3_ns3dj	1324973304.0	in2itiveact	pizza-gold	The definitive guide to ordering internationally	There are frequent questions on how to overcome the challenges of ordering a pizza from one country for delivery in another. As an Aussie who has had success arranging deliveries for many other countries I have put together the following guide.  Happy for anyone to ask questions for clarification or for anyone else that had had success to add to the info I have put together :)  Perhaps the mods can link to this in the sidebar if appropriate?   **International Random Acts of Pizza**   *The Aim*  To order pizza from one country for delivery in another.   *The Problem*  The only way to achieve this is to pay via credit card. Online credit card transactions often verify your identity by matching your card number with your name and address. If you don't have an address in the country you are ordering for, things fall apart.  Some of you are probably thinking about the vendors that offer PayPal as a payment method. Unfortunately you can't pay for something that is being delivered to a country other than your own when paying with PayPal, rendering it useless for international pizza giving.   *Things to consider*  The key to beating the system is figuring out exactly what the online pizza vendor in question uses to verify that you are the cardholder. Two things are universal - the cardholder name and the security code on the back of the card. Other than these two, vendors use some or all of the following:  Street address City/Suburb/Town etc Zip or postal code  The first two are easy to work with. The last can be problematic as different countries format their zip/postal codes in different ways. Some have four digits, some have five, some have six, some use letters - crazy!  Other vendors use credit card company specific verification - such as "Verified by VISA" - to verify ownership. Put simply, this would be simpler if everybody used this method as it asks you for information specific to your local bank.  Even if you can get past all these issues there are a few more important things to consider. All vendors, for example, say that they require the cardholder present at the delivery site. In my experience the only vendor that seems to follow through with this requirement is Pizza Hut in the United States. Others don't seem to. Arranging an order for pickup on the other hand has an increased risk that they will ask for the credit card used to pay for the order.  Another and perhaps more important issues is that these days your card issuer will actively try to prevent fraudulent use of your card. You can bet your bottom dollar that if they see one or two pizza transactions in countries other than your own on your card they will suspend it until they speak with you. It may be wise to notify them before you start ordering. My card issuer has been put on notice... Ignore international transactions at pizza stores! :)  Another issue you might face is the language barrier! More on this below.   **Beating the system**  I'm in Australia and have managed to successfully order pizzas for redditors in the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark. Here are some of the challenges I faced and the methods I used to get around them.   *Ordering for the USA*  The two easiest vendors are Dominos and Papa Johns. Though both say they require the cardholder to be present for the delivery, neither have ever done it for one of my deliveries. Dominos simply require a zip code when ordering. If you don't have a five digit code, add a zero to the front of yours to make five, or subtract some digits from the front or back of your cod to make five. This has worked for my 4 digit Australian zip code multiple times.  Papa Johns require a zip code and an address. I use my actual street address but use the town and state for the actual recipient. Again, I modify my own Australian postal code with a zero to make it fit. Again, multiple successes using this method.  Pizza Hut works using the above methods as well, but you have to get lucky to get a delivery driver who won't ask for the card when making the delivery.  Cashstar.com, which powers gift cards for many vendors, will not accept international credit cards period. Bummer.   *Ordering for Canada*  Problem! The online vendors in Canada all accept credit card, but don't transact over the Internet (Canadians, what is with this?) they take payment when they deliver the pizza. Despite this I've managed to arrange orders through some local vendors (not major chains) and Papa Johns by ordering online and then phoning through my credit card details. Unfortunately this means you need to make an international phone call to help out your Canadian friends.   *Ordering for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*  Dominos in the UK are easy, they use Verified by VISA (and presumably the comparable MasterCard system) that finds your actual card issuer based on your number and asks for localised information. You can enter your own geographical info as if you were ordering in your own country.   *Ordering for Germany/Denmark and other non-English speaking countries*  Luckily as far as the credit card transaction thing goes I've never had to enter anything other than the security code on the back of my card when transacting here. The problem has been with the language barrier.  I've managed to successfully deliver pizza thanks to the assistance of Google translate and the recipient guiding me through the order process using screenshots and in some cases even setting up an order and saving it, leaving me to simply add payment information.   *Ordering for Australia*  Being from Australia I can't speak to the challenges of ordering for here from elsewhere. I would love for someone from across the seas to look after an Aussie using the methods from above so we can verify that it works!  Having ordered pizza locally myself via the Dominos online system I'm almost certain that there is no verification against an address or zip/postal code at all. This, in theory, means that anyone should be able to order for Australia.   **Other things to consider**  Unlike gift certificates, paying via a credit card means you will need your recipients address so you can arrange a delivery on their behalf. I usually put the order in my name to avoid the recipient having to give out that information, but obviously their address is a must. I do, however, ask for the phone number of my recipient. This allows me to add it to the order in the event the driver needs to call them if they can't find the place.  If your recipient does give you their name, use it on the order but be sure to use your own name as the billing contact or cardholder.  In some cases you might attempt to arrange a carry out order for your recipient. This can be complicated as it is more likely than not that the vendor will require the credit card that paid for the order for verification. I have, as a result, avoided carry out orders.  In some countries tipping is customary. Papa Johns in the USA allow you to specify your tip when completing the order. Dominos on the other hand require the recipient to add it at the door (in this case I tell my recipient to add a reasonable amount when receiving the pizza). Please don't disregard this aspect when ordering a RAoP.  Good luck!	True

Christmas was not a very good one this year but we had each other and that is all that matters. The kids received a gift but we did not have a Christmas dinner this year. Bills ruled over everything and with it being the end of the month that really messed things up. Just wondering if we could have a couple of pizzas to brighten our holiday up. An Egift card would be a blessing. We have Pizza hut up the way if anyone can help.   Thanks a bunch Melissa

t3_nrdi4	1324927546.0	justaboy	shroom	Just found out about this reddit, thought I'd make a request, with offered exchange...	**Post final update** So, as it turns out, Dominos is a kind of awesomely exciting place to do this through, as they have a web app that tracks the pizza through ordering, prep, baking, 'quality control' and delivery. So I now know that my pizza is, at this very moment, enroute...  This will actually be the last update, as next I'll be making the new post with photographic proof of pizzatastic awesomeness (and bacon).   **Final Update: Do to the efforts of the Amazing Xandapanda and the Fantastic Igorcherfas, I am now about to order pizza. In honor of reddit, awesomeness, and deliciousness, there will be Bacon. Photographic evidence will be provided upon reception. I <3 REDDIT SO MUCH RIGHT NOW! =)**  So, I'm broke as hell this holiday season, rough market yadda yadda, I was planning to go to the Food Bank today (luckily where I live really has a great one - not just cans of mystery stuff, but locally grown produce, day old artisan breads, all sorts of great stuff) BUT they're closed for the holiday today. I can go on Wednesday, so it's not big deal, but until then, I have... umm... noodles. Not even ramen, just pasta, with uhh... salt and pepper <.< I won't starve, but the pantry is in bad shape, so when I found out about this reddit, I figured I'd ask. Here's what I offer in return:   First: I am confident that I'll be reemployed soon, and once I am, I will provide pizza, either in direct return for whoever provides me one, or if they prefer, in response to another request.  Second: Trying to think of skills I have that I can offer to do something useful or cool for you - around town I usually offer cooking (Ironic, huh?) but since it's relatively unlikely that you live nearby, and you'd have to provide the ingredients at this point anyhow... Only other thing I can do that is 'unusual' is kinda obsolete via the power of the intarwebs - in addition to English I speak Spanish, French, and German pretty well, and am passable in Italian, Japanese, and Mandarin. So maybe I could translate something for you? Or something? Suffice it to say if you can come up with something that I could do in return despite a lack of resources, I'd be down.  tl;dr: Super broke, food bank is closed, pizza would be awesome. If pizza happens, favor will be returned when I'm capable + ??? now.  Also - this reddit is inherently awesome; whether or not I get lucky here, if I get a decent job, I'll be here to make some contributions, if I get a /good/ job, I'll hopefully make a fair few =)  ,\\//   Live long and prosper, or something ;)   **Edit** Anyone who reads this should totally upvote Bakudai for offering, although sadly Papa John's fails to operate in Bellingham where I live =/  *EditEdit* **The amazing Xandapanda has offered to contribute $9 off of a gift card to a pizza from Domino's if anyone can help with the rest. I just want to make clear that even if no pizza comes of this, the offers and comments (heck, just getting this many Orangereds in one afternoon!) has made major steps towards achieving the stated goal of Restoring Faith in Humanity!**  *editeditedit* The above offer, it should be mentioned that the order, from Dominos, would probably be: They have a deal on where I can get a medium pizza AND some stuffed bread WITH BACON IN IT! for $5.99 ea + tax and delivery charge comes to $16.27; if that seems reasonable... so ~$7 more...   *editediteditedit* **We are very near success! The fantastic igorcherfas has purchased me an additional Dominos gift card, meaning that pending reopened contact with the aforementioned amazing Xandapanda, I will have pizza tonight! (with terrible webcam based photographic evidence!)**  This is officially the coolest thing that has ever happened to me via internet.	True

Over Thankgiving, I got a pizza offer from in2itiveact, but instead chose to pass my offer on to my brother, who needed it much more than I did at the time. Because of this, in2itiveact told me that the offer still stood for me and to contact him whenever I was in need. My family gave me an amazing Christmas and I decided to surprise them with this offer, if it still stood. in2itiveact, being the outstanding individual he is, said it did and has gone through with the offer.

Tonight I paid for one of those tostino's "party" pizzas with pennies out of a piggy jar. out of embarrassment I went to self checkout and tried to quietly put in penny after penny after penny... to pay for the thing.   Finally made it home and cooked the pizza. While slicing, my cheap dollar store pizza slicer broke. I totally didn't expect that to happen and, was of course, pushing down on the blade to cut the pizza. In one quick motion I cut a good inch nice and deep between my thumb and index finger, then plunged my injured hand into a hot pizza. I had to clean tomato sauce and cheese out of a flesh wound and throw away a pizza I paid for in freakin' PENNIES.  I'm hungry and angry and so dissapointed.

So hungry after 12 hours of work and no lunch	I posted yesterday, but by the time I got an offer, I had already made some oatmeal for myself and the girls and was back at work, so I didn't want to take away from someone who was truly hungry at that moment.

I have a dominos and pizza hut near by that would deliver. Also have a local pizza shop (Dino's) and chinese restaurant that will take telephone orders and deliver (I have a nail in my tire and can't get a new one til payday on the 29th, so I can't pick anything up or walk that far with the baby)   Thank you :)  I'm trying to post pics, but for someone reason, my post getss hidden when I include links??

t3_niv30	1324325637.0	softchkntaco	shroom	(Request)Trying this again from Sand Springs, OK	Hello all, first off I wanted to say that we have been helped here before, and it was a blessing for us, that is why it is so hard to post here. I am hoping that someone out there will be able to help us. We are down to plain white rice. I am a single mom with a daughter that is 16. I try the best I can and can usually keep us in clean clothes and a place to live, but we would love some pizza. Some meat, cheese, sauce, and dough would be just the ticket on such a cold and rainy day. I think one of those big box meals from Pizza Hut would last the two of us for a few days. I went to some food banks today and got a few packages of ramen and some canned goods, but no meat. :( So, please, if someone out there could help my daughter and I out, we would be eternally grateful, and I can pay it back several times over come tax time, which is not too far away. So, thanks for reading and even if you can't help, please think good things for us.	
t3_nid3h	1324289432.0	chloe-bell	PIF	REQUEST So Hungry in north east Pennsylvania	It's 5 am. I'm at work for another hour yet, then I go home and get my little girl ready for kindergarten and wait until my 2 year old gets up so I can feed her breakfast and brush her teeth, then I put up the baby gates and try to cat nap for a little on the sofa while she sits with me and watches TV or plays with her little dolls.  Some of the other people here ordered out tonight, I think from Dunkin Donuts. The food smells so good and I'm so hungry, but all I have with me is a bag of pretzels and the water fountain and no money to buy food without cutting myself short on gas money.  There is nothing I would love more than to go home and be able to order a pizza for lunch. A break from chicken & rice soup that I made last week and froze would be heavenly.  My little girls love pizza too but rarely get to eat Pizza Hut or Dominos. A pie would feed us til tomorrow and make our tummies super happy. I'd be glad to share pics too. We are located in north east Pennsylvania. An hour north of Harrisburg. Please?

I'm done with all but one of my final exams for this semester, and I know lots of you are going through finals hell right now too. There are two things I want from you:  * Tell me about your favorite class from this past semester, and why it was your favorite.  **AND**  * Show me a picture of you studying your ass off for finals.  Whichever post/picture I like the best will get the $15 to either Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut.

Good luck, and may the nerdiest one win!   **EDIT** Holy cow, this is going to be harder than I expected! There are some intelligent and hard-working redditors on RAoP.

You're also in a religious studies class, which I think is cool (being an anthropology major myself), your [/r/dota2](/r/dota2) friend seems to think you're a good person, and I fucking hate carrots, so it sucks that that's all you have to eat haha. What really won it for me though was the paper you're writing on Darfur. I'm part of my school's STAND organization, Students Taking Action Now for Darfur. It means a lot to me!

t3_nca79	1323861673.0	DEStudent	PIF	Upfront and Honest in Delaware	Good Afternoon all:  So most of you know I'm a wife and student and stepmother. I also volunteer for a crisis hotline. I posted a few days ago requesting Pizza Hut so my husband and I could have a little romance and time away from my stepson who has been a **Major pain in the neck**. I figure I would ask again. We have some food here until Friday, but pizza would be a nice treat. I enjoyed some last week thanks to JetBoyTerp. I don't have a sob story or anything. I'm just a stepmother, wife, student and volunteer that would love to just enjoy some pizza rather than left-over **generic sloppy joes**. In exchange for your kindness I will send you my husband and I's security catalog (home business) and 3 free safety reports. Not much I know but... Hey I'm trying. I just don't have much to offer.   Oh wait: If you would be kind enough to treat me to pizza, I would be kind enough to mail you a free Moody Teenager! Yes, that's right- a teenager. You know, the cell phone obsessed, back-talking, whiney person? That's a joke, people. :-) Anyway the catalog and security reports are all I can offer for now.  I hope you all have a great day! THANK YOU for reading  **Edit- wow, the haters are out already. I wish this reddit would block downvotes.... If I'm wrong, please forgive me but I keep noticing I'm being downvoted. Come on, let's stop the cruelity.**	True

The order went through fine.  Last night, I tried to order for myself and after an hour and a half, I called the restaurant and was told they had no record of the order.  I've been going back and forth with foodler support today, and I found out the person who gifted me the $25 issued a chargeback over a month later.  Foodler decided the chargeback meant my account was compromised and locked my account.  I'm not sure how we can avoid something like this for the rest of us, but take this as a warning that these things can (and do) happen.  I really enjoy this subreddit and we all do great things here.  Let's try and keep this sort of thing from happening again, shall we?  tl;dr, RAOPer gifted me on foodler, issued a chargeback, and now my foodler account has been suspended.  Edit:  It seems foodler has chalked this up as a loss and they've unblocked my account.	True

It's the awkward few weeks at the end of the semester where I have no money because my only source of income is my grant refund and I don't get my Spring one for a bit yet. There's no food in and as I've mentioned I lack the funds to buy food.   What I do however have is copper wire and glass beads. I make rings as a hobby (http://mustard.leadpipecollection.net/Jewl/Atlantis0/ if you want to see some of my work). So, I'm offering a copper and glass(bead) ring to anyone willing to buy me a pizza. Just be willing to give me your American ring size, address and anything you're picky about (Gender identity &c.)   Now maybe you're thinking "If he can ship a ring how come he can't buy pizza!?" well, see It is about $3 to ship a ring and that's barely a tip if you get a pizza.

Or you can PM the MODS as some of them are aware of the group home that I represent. My name is Haleigh and I am a volunteer at a girls group home. I have been asked by the MODS to not list information pertaining to the home itself for obvious reasons. The girls would like to have a holiday party. We have to call it a holiday party because not all of the girls celebrate the same holiday on the same day. We have a total of 9 girls with us now. As I have mentioned before they are here for various reasons such as orphaned, runaway, or have a case pending in family court and they are not allowed to live with their families right now. A few of the girls have lived here for a long time. As a volunteer I do my best to play the role of big sister and from time to time come up with ideas to make life a little easier, and happier for them. They want to have a Holiday party, we do not always have the funds available when the girls make such a request and so we would like to ask the Reddit community if they would like to participate by donating a pizza.

t3_n6dmb	1323449109.0	elgreco927	dragon	I'll come back to RAoP and give away 10 pizzas to hungry Redditors. Details inside.	So here's my proposal.  Please read this [X-post from /r/secretsanta](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/n37da/i_have_a_favor_to_ask_of_all_you_secret_santas/), and spread the word via FB, Twitter, upvotes, etc.  If my friend can meet her fundraising goal before xmas, I'll come back to RAoP and give away 10 pizzas.  **ORIGINAL POST:**  This may not be the right subreddit for this, but since we are all here to share a little joy this holiday season, I thought I'd make a humble request of this awesome reddit community.  I have been racking my brain trying to think of a xmas gift this year for a very dear friend of mine.  Today, she posted on FB about her fundraising efforts for the March of Dimes, and I got an idea.    She and her family have participated in the March for Babies walk every year since losing their 12-day-old baby daughter Tera back in 2001 due to a congenital heart defect.  Her FB post mentioned that any donations through the end of the year [will be matched](https://www.marchofdimes.com/giving/support_yearend.html), effectively doubling the donation.  I thought it would be awesome if a bunch of random redditors started donating to her [March for Babies team](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&ct=4&w=5202211&u=TeamTeraUT) out of the blue.  She would be dumbfounded.  Her fundraising goal is $500, and if she could meet that goal before XMAS, it would **BLOW HER MIND!**  So please, all you wonderful secret santas out there -- how about taking on one more giftee for any donation amount at all?  I'll pledge that if she reaches her $500 goal before Dec. 25, **I'll donate an additional $200 myself.**   So thank you all for reading this.  If you want to read up more on the charity, you can go to the [March for Babies](http://www.marchforbabies.org/) web site.  You can donate to my friend's team, Team Tera, on her team's [donation web page](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&ct=4&w=5202211&u=TeamTeraUT).  **THANK YOU!!**  -----------------------   **TL;DR** - As a gift to a friend, I'm trying to raise money for her [March for Babies fundraising team](http://www.marchforbabies.org/personal_page.asp?pp=3599083&ct=4&w=5202211&u=TeamTeraUT).  I'm hoping awesome secret santas such as yourselves might want to help.  :-)  -----------------------  **EDIT:** Dec 9 2011 @ 11:45am CST - Got a **HUGE** [donation from moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/n6dmb/ill_come_back_to_raop_and_give_away_10_pizzas_to/c36lm4z), and now we're at $205!!!  Please show him/her some love in the form of upvotes or anything else you can think of!  THANK YOU!  **EDIT:** Dec 11 2011 @ 11:00pm CST - We're currently 60% of the way there, with $300 raised so far!  Thank you!    ----------------  .  .  .  **GOAL MET!!!!** Thank you to everyone who made donations and spread the word, it truly is appreciated!     As promised, [I donated $200 more](http://imgur.com/a/IX1fu), and now I'll get started on giving away some pizzas!    And now, down to the important business of donating some pizzas to some hungry Redditors! I've already [given 1 pizza away](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nkgge/yay_for_elgreco927_and_pizza_thank_you/).  So that leaves 9 more.    **See my [new RAOP post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/npehz/offer_march_of_babies_fundraising_goal_met_im/) about giving away the first 3 of those 9 pizzas today!**  Thanks again, Reddit.  You guys are awesome. :-D    	True

And Thank you to PastafarianTwit (he knows why)**    **Edit #2- Please keep trying and if you can spare it, help someone else eat tonight. Oh yeah and if you select the Pizza Tracker, go with the Island theme.

That doesn't mean if you live elsewhere you can't keep trying. Feed yourself, feed a friend, feed a stranger! Tonight is pretty cold here on the east coast.

t3_n47fu	1323310480.0	thebigfish69		REALLY??? RAOP restoring humanity 1 pizza @ a time? Harrassing PM's not my definition of humanity.	There is a lot of good happening with RAOP however I got a few few horrible PM's from fellow redditors who thought I was not deserving of even making a rquest. If a person does not understand or believe a requestors situation then they should just keep their opinions 2 themselves. I made a request because being on disability does not afford me the luxury of being able 2 buy myself a pizza. Also let me just say that those of u who wrongfully misjudged me should be thanking me because I am a vet and went 2 war 4 ur freedom.  So just stop all the hating. There really are poor, lonely. And desperate people out there. Not every1 is bad. Not every story is a scam.  EDIT: the only thing I want to accomplish by posting this is for others to see that by passing judgement on people and making public comments or even PM's that they might actually be hurting someone in true need. someone who came to reddit, or RAOP for a little compassion. I want nothing and ask 4 nothing. Thanks	True

Be honest!!  I'll try to remember to give it out tonight but if not, tomorrow at the absolute latest.  P.S. I promised tonciap that I would send a picture of my puppy with the pizza when I got it.

t3_n2l2j	1323186437.0	DEStudent	PIF	REQUEST- Just being honest in New Castle, Delaware 19720	Hey Reddit:  I'm coming to request pizza for lunch or dinner tonight. I don't want to be the queen of sob stories, I just want to be honest and give you a little information on what's going on. Well my stepson (17) made some very serious false accusations because he's got misdirected anger at Dad.  Since my stepson made these phone calls, he's felt like he's an untouchable... (I don't have to listen to my parents and you can't touch me!) But more than that, last night my husband and I got a phone call and the person that performed our marriage ceremony died of a massive heart attack. He was like an uncle and a mentor.   Pizza would really cheer me up and make this difficult time in life much easier. I have given before and received.  I'm a FT college student that volunteers for a crisis center and is married to a good man. And I know some where deep, deep, deep (did I mention DEEP) down inside, my stepson is a good kid too. Just going through a hard time since his mother kicked him out.  Thanks for listening and even if you can't give pizza, just a cyber hug or moral support is always welcome.   **THANK YOU**  **EDIT- THANK YOU TO JETBOYTERP for making a difficult situation a little easier to cope with! You are a special person, not just because you helped me, but I've seen the wonderfulness you've spread around reddit. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU**	True

Last night, I was hanging out in the IRC chat, just killing time after realizing that I probably wasn't getting a pizza any time soon. Gluebag saw me mention that I made a request that wasn't answered and decided to buy me a pizza!  Thank you so much, Gluebag, and everyone else here. I know you wanted a picture of the pizza, but I couldn't find the charger for my camera's battery. Does a "you are a wonderful human being, and the pizza was delicious" suffice?

t3_n175l	1323100768.0	ThrowAway01890		(Request)Pizza for sick father-in-law and A couple. 	I'm hiding behind this throwaway account because I am embarrassed to ask for help again. We've received pizza before when we were homeless a couple months back. However we moved recently in our new apartment and were already late on rent so all our money went towards bills. My father is lending us gas money tomorrow to get to the food pantry but today I'm not sure what we are going to do.   My husbands father is staying a couple weeks with us because he wasn't getting the proper care where he lives at. He has heart problems and is diabetic, and he has to eat which makes me feel terrible because we had to pay a more big of a late fee then I thought and I feel that we are letting him down by us as well not giving him the proper care he needs.     We have no children so I can understand if we aren't helped.  However, if someone does help, I can give them my real account name, and I wouldn't mind taking a picture as well, whatever works.  Thanks.

t3_mxumz	1322854220.0	CaptainPlatypus	pizza	Awful Week, Pizza is Delicious	Hey RAOP. As you can tell by the mushroom, I've already received pizza here from an extraordinarily generous person. I'm honestly feeling pretty bad for asking again. But fuck it, I'm hungry, I'm nearly broke, I'm worrying about Christmas presents and paying bills, my now-ex-girlfriend called me to tell me she'd cheated on me first thing this morning and I've been crying off and on all day, and I've decided I'm beyond the point where I'm too proud to try to cash in on these things for pizza. Same thing applies as last time I asked a few months back - I'm not going to go hungry if I don't get pizza, but damn would it ever make my day better.  I'm willing to give away any of my many wholly-unmarketable skills to you or anyone you please as the only sort of pay-it-forward I can muster, such as DotA (or extremely basic Starcraft II) training, writing, providing tech support, or doing any number of other things that at least half of reddit could do. Hell, I'm willing to do that even without pizza, so if you want one of those things, let me know!

t3_mxpe6	1322846631.0	jellybean545	shroom	Help me celebrate the (almost) end of my first semester of Nursing School! 	Dear RAOP,   I am in my first semester of Nursing school, and just completed a week that had four exams and two papers. This was the last regular week of classes before finals. It has been a crazy few months. Anyone that tells you nursing school is easy is LYING. Or a robot. Either one. But anyways, I've tried really hard to study, practice, and read. There hasn't been much time left for the whole eating/sleeping part of life. I guess I just wanted to take the afternoon off from everything and relax to do something for myself, including eating my weight in pizza. I was just wondering if someone would be kind enough to contribute a pizza for (perhaps) your future nurse? I live in New Hampshire, I moved here to go to school and don't know a ton of people, so it'd be nice to think that I have a buddy somewhere out there to virtually share lunch with me. Thanks guys, even just writing this made me feel better :)   Edit: I will definitely be paying this forward! Thanks guys!	True

Since then, there have been some cool things that have happened.  I loved the idea of someone waking up one day and randomly getting a pizza from a stranger. I tried giving out a few and it was fun. Now when I open Reddit, I find myself not paying too much attention to the RAOP posts. I have a hard time seeing all of the post where people are so down on there luck that they cannot afford to eat or feed their families. This seems to be the story behind 95% of the requests. Its downright depressing.  I applaud every single one of you that are able to give and I know that you are receiving immense satisfaction by doing so but I unfortunately have to say farewell. Call me a deserter, but there are some things that I cannot change.   I leave you with this.  *You can add pepperonis to the italian cheese bread at Little Caesers and it is incredible. *Same thing goes for the cheesesticks at Papa Johns. *The italian seasoning packets that you get from Papa Johns and Little Caesers (spice packs) make the most incredible hamburgers. Load up on those whenever you can. *The papa johns I go to will sell you dough for 2$. Sometimes when I cant afford a big pizza order I will make my own at home for alot cheaper. *Retailmenot.com is a great resource for pizza coupons. Or any coupons for that matter.  Thanks guys! Farewell.

t3_mrkk6	1322452124.0	BossNobody	shroom	Hey guys, if you were interested in an update. Not a request.	Heres the link to the story and original request. This is not a request. Hopefully I will be sending out a pizza in December. http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/im22e/requestfamily_has_been_going_through_some_tough/  Dad's been out of the hospital is getting better. He still has a bad attitude, and outlook on life now. He still is pretty frail and weak, he doesn't seem to want to eat much and isn't bulking up.  We're keep the house for now, mainly because neither me nor my brothers have finished our education yet and we don't yet have jobs. So there is no way to get a new place. We have the money for the place but the people want assurance that if my parents were to pass, we could still pay it off. So basically my brothers and I are in rush mode to finish out education. Not much can be done there except passing the time, it's kind of hard to rush through a system were you need a lot of time.  I've been trying to keep up with school, while trying to be home to take care of my dad. I still don't have a car yet, so I can't work anything far or I need to get to quick. I'm trying to find work close by I can bike to, I've been on and off some part times trying to pay for my own schooling and food.  Things are coming along. Just need time and for everybody to hang in there.  I'll probably be sending posting an offer to send out a pizza in around 2 weeks, when I can get some money. I'd like to return the favour before I am unable to. Does anyone want a pizza, but can hold out for a while? If so send me a PM? May I can just paypal someone the money and they can buy someone a pizza. Anyone up for that? I'd like assurance or a receipt to know if the people actually got the pizza I paid for though.

t3_mrh18	1322446352.0	quv		Can I pay someone with Paypal for a pizza? Papa John's won't accept Paypal. 	Hi, RAoPers. Payday isn't until Thursday, and all the money I currently have is in Paypal. None of the local pizza places accept Paypal, so I'm hosed. I have some random things around the house, we're not starving or anything, but it's basically just chips and a can of corn and such things. I have three children, I'm having some marital problems with the husband, and things kind of suck right now. I'm not looking for a handout, just a sort of loan, I guess you could call it. For a pizza tonight, I'd gladly pay you back via Paypal right away. It's just one of those nights where stress and a lack of cash makes me want pizza so freaking bad. If you need verification, PM me and I can give you more information. It's just one of those nights, y'know?

Unfortunately I wasn't sent home with any thanksgiving left overs, and I have just about nothing at my home to eat, as well as 2 dollars to my name.  I will draw a picture, or teach you how to play a song on guitar, or really whatever fun thing you can think of.   But really, a cheese and hamburger pizza would be incredible. Also, I will repay this pizza next week on the dot.   Thanks a bunch. :)

So, all the Thanksgiving leftovers are finally gone and we have been sitting here wondering what to have for dinner as it is also the end of the month and there is not much in the kitchen to eat. The this commercial came on advetising the Big Box Meal from Pizza Hut. It is 19.99 and is more than enough to feed my small family of 3.5 (2 adults, 1 child, 1 small child). We were hoping some lovely redditor would be able to help us out with getting one. We would be so grateful and even post thank-you pics! I can provide verification also. Thanks for reading and even if you can't help, please keep us in your prayers that things will turn around for us soon. :)

Sacramento, Ca	Hello, I am a lurker and decided to try my luck as I have been reading on here for some time. I would very much love if someone could spare a pizza, I cracked my hand on Thanksgiving by tripping and hitting the nightstand.   Thankfully it did not break but it is badly bruised and I spent a fortune going to the ER. I cannot cook well right now as it is my right hand and  I am of course right handed. I took the splint off as it actually makes life harder. My teenager would be helpful but he is too busy chasing girls to help mom much. I am hunting and pecking right now which is not as fun as it sounds.  So please generous people of reddit if you can, please help me. If not I appreciate you reading this. Thanks to all.

t3_mqc2x	1322353209.0	in2itiveact	pizza-gold	Dominos and St. Jude's Children's Hospital	Hey all,  Some of you may have noticed that if you order a pizza through Dominos between now and the end of the year you can donate anywhere between $1 and $10 to St. Jude's Children's Hospital - best of all, Dominos match all donations until they get to $250,000.  I learned of St. Jude's through Celebrity Apprentice and John Rich believe it or not, and even from way down under here in Australia I can see it's a cause worth supporting.  So, if it suits you in your Random Act of Pizza to use Dominos, and if your already clear generosity extends a little bit more to throw some dollars their way, please do :)  Because of that I've been using Dominos where possible, just to extend the Random Act of Pizza kindness towards St. Jude's as well.  Happy Pizza-ing! :)

t3_mmxzg	1322071674.0	MarcusParadis		(Request) First Thanksgiving by myself, ain't got a thing to cook and of coarse I'm broke like a stone. Athens Georgia.	My names Marcus and I live in Georgia. Basically I got uninvited to a dinner party tomorrow and I'm stuck out of luck in the food department until Sunday. I got some tuna but no bread or mayo, 2 cans of chef boyardee, a few hamburger pattys but no buns, and a can of black beans. That's the literal contents of my fridge and pantry, and while it's better than nothing at all like some folks have I'm a little less than thankful this year.  My mom died last year and I'm still paying out of pocket to get everything situated with that. If I have any other family I don't know them so spending the holidays with anyone is out of the question. My girlfriend went up to Tennessee but I couldn't get off work so eating with her family is out of the question. And my best friend of over three years told me flat out today his wife doesn't want me to come because her parents are going to be there. So for the first time in my life I'm completely alone on turkey day and it's depressing the heck out of me.  So yeah, no family or friends or money means no black olives, turkey, gravy, those little marshmallows, etc for me tomorrow. Any way I could score some pizza money today so I can get some wings or something? I'd much rather warm something up tomorrow than eat a can of plain tuna or some lousy canned spaghetti. Thanks for any help or well wishes you might offer.

I wasnt sure what      would come out of it and I wont lie I wasn't very optimistic.                  Then Kwip shows up and offers to help me out, Im thrilled. Even better      he offers to have the food delivered to my place! What an angel.                       Here comes the best part. I was expecting and would have been more   than satisfied with just a single pizza like I asked for. The delivery guy   who was supposed to show up at 7:30 pm shows up 30 mins early   :p.Luckily I was home by then, but looking at all the food in his hands    Im confused. There was way too much food in his hands,I coudnt   fathom this order being mine and the time did not match. I did not   want to take anyone elses order and wanted to see if my upstairs   neighbours had ordered anything before I accepted this. He gives me a   name which isnt mine (I realize now its Kwips) and looking at the   confusion on my face he decides to call Kwips phone. Getting no   answer he thinks this isnt my order and says hell take it back.By now I   have realized nobody else in my apartment has ordered and the order   was from Kwip! I give him my name and ask him to check again and   after a few minutes of talking and negotiating in Spanglish he gives in   and gives me the order and leaves.                 And there instead of a single Pizza I was expecting were 2 huge   bottles of soda, cheese bread, cinnamon pie, Chicken wings and a     Pepperoni pizza.                   Tl;dr Kwip is awesome.If someday I somehow had a million bucks I    would give him $500,000 without a second thought.          More realistically I would buy this man a respect beer If I ever get to   meet him after I turn 21.                         Oh and this sub reddit is awesome too!I love you almost as much as I   love Kwip.                    I also intend to pay this forward on the first of December.                   Cheers

I was just feeling rather discouraged with my school work and then I received that PM and it made me feel loads better.   I will share the winnings with my friends and girlfriend at home this weekend. :) Thank you!  Edit: In my excitement, I forgot to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving!  I will post pictures with my friends and the pizza later!	True
t3_mkv6y	1321924792.0	rainbowpig	shroom	(Request) I am living with my aunt and parents have basically disowned me for being gay.	Hi everyone, thanks for all the support you guys gave me last week when I posted on here originally. I honestly got so many messages I couldn't respond to them all. As you may know I came out to my parents and it didn't go very well at all. My aunt is letting me crash on her couch and we're working on clearing out a room for me to stay in full time. Dad packed all my boxes and left them out on the side of the street so not surprisingly a lot of my stuff is either broken or missing.  So as it is right now I'm not going back to school. It's become public knowledge that I'm gay and it's been a 50/50 response of positive and negative. I did some research and found out I can go to adult education and have my GED in as little as 2 months so that's what I'm going to do. I gotta start paying rent here in a few months so I need to find a job and applying places is a full time thing in itself. Still being a HS student closes a lot of doors I need open right now.  I feel like a jerk for asking again but I didn't get a chance to enjoy the last pizza I got. I got a slice or two of it and didn't think to take it with me when I left (I had a killer order too, I've been kicking my own ass about forgetting to grab it). If it's in the cards and someone can slide me some then great. My aunt works until 10 pm all this week so it'd be cool if I could surprise her with some tonight or tomorrow. I've been cooking a lot of the meals as a way of trying to help out.  If nothing else this serves as a way to let people who were curious know about how I am now. 	
t3_mkt13	1321921373.0	wtfmercedes		Request Pizza For Mercedes!	So, I am 20 years old and for the past two months due to a fight with me and mom, (she didn't wanna fill out my fasfa form so i can get a grant for college), I have been homeless. I don't drive, and I didn't have a job for a while I just recently started working part time at a buffet I don't get paid for another two weeks. I make it day by day with help from my friends, I don't know where I am going to sleep every night, or how I am going to eat. And most of the time I will go without food, But a friend of mine told me about random acts of pizza and how they help people in situations like mine. So, it would help me a lot if someone can help me eat for the week. I don't like asking for things, and I feel dumb because I am asking for food. But its to the point where I don't have very many options. Thanks, <3 Mercedes.

t3_mib1l	1321733407.0	haleigh321		Group Home for girls could use a little pizza for a pick me up.	You can verify my story with the MODS if you contact them they will in fact confirm it for you. My name is Haleigh and I am a volunteer with a Group Home for girls here in Florida. I cannot list the name of the home for obvious reasons but if you PM me I can give you the website if you require more info. We currently have 8 girls who are here for various different reasons such as runaway, orphaned, or they have a case pending in family court and are not allowed to be with their families right now. We were suppose to have a guest treat the girls to Mcdonald's today but backed out last night. Saturday is the one day a week the girls get to do something fun. Since the home relies on donations we do not have the funds to provide activities if there are none available. So I wanted to ask the reddit community if they could give the girls a break and buy them some pizza so they can just relax and forget about their problems for a while. If you PM me requesting info I will get it back to you as soon as possible. Thanks so much.  EDIT: Thanks so much to jayce513 for making a gift of pizza for the girls.	True

I will be getting some financial help from my folks hopefully in the next few weeks and will pay it forward as soon as I can. If anyone can help me we have Round Table and Domino's or Mountain Mikes.

I was the only one to show up to work today besides the foreman. I got quite a bit done despite the weather. Needless to say I was dead tired getting home. No food in the house, no money to get some food, etc. I hadn't eaten in quite a while, clearly.  She did a little creepin' to find out my address and sent me a pizza even though I kept saying things like "noooo no it's ok" and "I don't need it", manly things like that. Even though I didn't actually want her to do that for me, I can't thank her enough. She's too nice to me sometimes.  http://imgur.com/ITGw9

Can be really hard to send pizza to another country if their pizza order place is not in English  To help making this a bit easier. I took a few screenshoots and worked some magic in Microsoft Paint and added some explanations to it.  Hopefully using this you, will be able to throw some pies to Denmark.  Maybe others could set something like this up for their country as well?  http://imgur.com/a/G2UlS#0

t3_mbmy6	1321257055.0	Pizza_King		THANKS! 2 'CAPN20' 	I work at a local Pizza Hut, and from time to time we get a few 'down on their luck' folks that come in for either water or they have gathered some change that I usually let qualify as enough for the lunch buffet. My boss doesn't know I do this, so I try not to do it so often, but I can't help myself. (I cover the difference)  Last Tuesday, a guy in line behind a homeless man offered to cover his buffet, since the homeless man was a few bucks short. He also covered the homeless couple that were outside the store. He returned Thursday and Friday and did the same thing, for the same three folks. Friday afternoon I asked him why he was being so generous and he said "You can thank Reddit.com's Random act of Pizza". I have never been to reddit.com b4, I had no clue that such a place existed and I think it's freaking awesome. Such a great place for people that are 'down on their luck' or just 'plain ol' hungry'. I LOVE IT!! After looking at this website over the weekend, I talked to my boss about CAPN20 and the idea of paying it forward, and she agreed that it is wonderful.   So, to the guy that signs his ticket CAPN20, for the homeless folks that just needed a pick-me-up, Thanks. Next time I see you, hopefully soon, I will get to tell you in person that my boss has agreed to meet you in 'funding' if you do continue your awesome giving. She said "If not, then we will continue with the same 3 per day, even if the faces change"    Thanks. And if any of you happen upon CAPN20, just in case he doesn't return to the store, tell him I wrote all this for him.	
t3_mb9vu	1321233318.0	hawkeyepeers	shroom	Thank You Mr. Slugworth!	Many thanks to Badbrownie. You compared my living situation to that of the family in ["Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"](http://i.imgur.com/Ih1kG.jpg), in response I must say that the [pizza factory](http://i.imgur.com/0TBXv.jpg) was a lot of fun to visit. Sadly I did not win the factory because of my overwhelming need to obtain the ["magic bacon producing pig"](http://i.imgur.com/YiBle.jpg)... Wonka says that I will heal in due time... Then we got the pizza from [Dominos](http://i.imgur.com/OPPY6.jpg)! We split up the card so that my wife and I got a [pizza](http://i.imgur.com/KwWEN.jpg) last night (Kiddos were asleep), We had pizza for [lunch](http://i.imgur.com/1E9Nq.jpg) today, and we had Pizza for [dinner](http://i.imgur.com/JhPoR.jpg) as well! We were so grateful for your generosity that we had a ["Badbrownie party"](http://i.imgur.com/bfFI9.jpg) for desert. In order to have a Badbrownie party, the brownies needed to, of course, be bad. I had the kiddos explain [why their brownies were bad](http://imgur.com/a/nfiQn#0). Everybody had a great time, that is except for [Grune](http://i.imgur.com/DWPKI.jpg)!    	True

t3_mbh50	1321245447.0	SoManyNinjas		Goudie! Thank you so so so much!!	Okay, this has nothing to do with pizza, but this wonderful person deserves recognition. I posted on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/m9i5u/offer_thanksgiving_dinner_package_for_68_people/) explaining my story about my family's situation. I didn't expect any kind of response from anyone, but goudie had other ideas. This kind individual has effectively ensured that this Thanksgiving, my father would get to enjoy a delicious meal, that would maybe make life a little easier, at least for a little while.   goudie, I just wanted to say thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. You have no idea how much your generous gift means to myself and my family. I don't have much money, but if you're ever hungry (and I know it's no Thanksgiving Dinner), I can promise you a piping hot pizza, yours to claim whenever you'd like it.   Really, I can't possibly thank you enough. Your willingness to give in the way that you have fills my heart with joy and brings fresh hope for Humanity.   I would also like to request that the mods give goudie some nice flair to appropriately reflect a gift of this magnitude.   Considering the situation I'm currently in, I can't offer anything of equal value, but you have a standing offer for any pizza of your choice, and you have my eternal gratitude. Really. Thank you.

t3_mbcj7	1321237657.0	saranglinux	shroom	request. a very hungry student who got scammed trying to help another desperate person	my name is andrew kim im a undergrad student at ucsd (structural engineering major) and ive been out of funds for the past week. i live on camino raposa and earlier this week i was on my way to vons to buy some groceries when a random guy came up to me in his infiniti and asked desperately that he needed gas to go to irvine. first thing i thought was to help him out cause it reminded me of the saying "today you, tommorow me". So i decided to lend him money for gas because the person seemed to be dressed properly, had a decent car, and didnt seem to be a scammer to me. he took me to the nearest atm and i thought he would just ask for 40 dollars for a full tank when he said that he would appreciate around 160 dollars which he could pay back this upcoming saturday. i had 100 dollars in my debit card...so i gave him 80. 20 for myself to buy some needed groceries. He then left repeatedly thanking me for my generosity and said that if i called him this saturday he would repay me the amount as well as a gift certificate at a restaurant that he works at. Now it is sunday, i called him around 10 times on saturday and has not picked up. At this point i am guessing that he isnt going to be paying me back and now i have no money for any kind of food and am very hungry atm. i cooked rice and ate it by itself because i didnt have anything to cook but i am still starving. i would appreciate any kind of kindness reddit

Instead, I devised a few riddles for you to have fun with. If you enjoy the challenge they present maybe you'll reward me with a gift card for my cleverness? It never hurts to try. So here you go, a few riddles to toy around with while you debate whether or not I deserve a hot meal today.  1.) What's 4 inches long but can house all of your buds?  2.) If I press hard enough I might strike a face that makes me a wealthier man. What am I?  3.) How many links are in the chain when it clinks?  4.) Right now may not seem like spring at all, but I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow, and then all of these will belong to you.  5.) I had a cat I named him Earl. I had a fish I named him Pearl. But what should I name my bird of prey?  I hope you enjoyed my little challenge of wits, I'll post the answers later regardless of whether or not I receive a gift card. So best of luck and see how many you can get right. And if you feel like helping a guy a bit down on his luck eat tonight feel free to message me or post below.   Thanks again and remember, a mind is a terrible thing to waste, but it's even more terrible to waste a mind.

Basically my job has screwed me over on the most recent paycheck and it won't get here until Monday (I hope). I checked my account this morning, no pending deposits, mail just ran and no paper check either. Waters getting shut off sometime today or tomorrow and they won't let me setup a new payment arrangement. So i ended up filling a few 2 liter bottles we had lying around so we can at least flush the toilet and wash our hands until Monday. Pretty sad it's come to that but nothing I can do about it.  Well my daughter pretty much hates me right now for not taking her out to eat last night like I promised. And my son isn't thrilled with the choices we have in the fridge since I failed to get any groceries yesterday either. Some pizza would sure be a boost right now if anyone could provide us with some.

t3_m8xmy	1321035835.0	earthboundimmortalJE	shroom	(Requesting) Didn't get paid today, need something desperately -Hollywood Florida-	I started working at this job 4 weeks ago, my first pay check came in paper form which is normal, and my second onward is setup for direct deposit. Well, I found out today that they do their payroll on Thursdays. Because of the fact today's a banking Holiday it's going to take longer than usual for it to hit my account. It might not clear until Monday for God's sake, and that just doesn't make a bit of sense to me. Number one why would they wait until Thursday to do payroll when the work week ends on Saturdays and two, why wouldn't they do it a bit earlier on account of the holiday weekend to make sure we get paid? I had a payment arrangement with the water to get it caught up today, I'll be lucky if they don't shut it off and charge me a new deposit to restart it.  So to make a long story short before I let off anymore steam I'm a single dad, the mother of my two kids ran out on me a few years ago and hasn't been seen since. I promised them I'd take them out to eat tonight and I just can't do it now, is there any way someone could send us some pizza so our night isn't completely ruined?

If you would like to be included in this video, all you have to do is link me to your thank-you photo you've previously posted, or you can make a new one.  I would like to see some pictures of thumbs up, with RAoP somewhere in the picture (piece of paper, hand, etc), or you can just put "Thank you, RAoP" and you can feel free to include your username.  I want to see smiiiiiles.  I want to see happy faces of people who just got pizza from a stranger and it's made their night.  If you've received from here before, you know what I'm talking about!  And if you don't want to put your face in the photo, that's entirely fine!  Do you have a dog? A cat? An awesome action figure?  Cool.  Just put your little paper sign beside of them and snap that picture.  I really hope that you want to participate, because I really want this to be the most awesome video ever.  Thanks for reading.  May the force be with you.  Live Long and Prosper. xx  **Edit:** I have been getting a few offers for a pizza since I'm making this video, but in all honesty, I'd prefer if pizzas went to those who needed them this weekend.  Though I wouldn't mind a pack of cigarettes, I know that won't happen. Btw; why is there not a random acts of nicotine?!  I'm kidding.  But if you **did** want to help me in some way, I would appreciate a dollar donation towards my NaNoWriMo fundraiser I'm doing.  You don't have to, but if you wanted to help a gal out, I'd surely appreciate it.  Otherwise, thank you to everyone who has submitted photos and I'll be uploading the video probably around 11PM tonight, as well as linking it here once it's uploaded.

There was also a video of the driver coming up but I felt bad for flashing a crazy bright light in his face. He seemed very confused about the whole thing. Gruk paid for the tip as well, and being a previous delivery driver years ago this made me very happy. It is especially nice since he didn't know how much to give not being from a location where tipping is expected and gave a crazy generous 15%. Probably fed the driver as well.

t3_m6mi7	1320877032.0	Nerobus	shroom	Dear RAOP, lets talk about good sportsmanship when it comes to contests for pizza.	Yes, I'm aware this subject has come up before, but apparently we all  need a reminder.  So, I've been subscribed to this subreddit for a long time... as in I was one of the first 100-300 people or so.  I have remained largely a lurker here, seeing as I have very little money to give pizzas, and never the type to ask for things, I just enjoy watching the amazing acts on this subreddit.  I do however participate in little contests held for pizza as the prize when I can.  I LOVE the idea of a little contest, and I think it's really just all in good fun, but for some reason, I've begun to notice a large number of very rude comments made when someone submits something.  I assume this is an attempt to make up for the inability to down vote someone here (a feature I appreciate), but still... there is no need for this.  Now, this has happened to me 3 times now over the few months or so, but I've seen it MANY times done to others.  I also see a huge lack of compliments, as if giving someone a compliment would lower your chances in winning?    This isn't cool guys.  If someone submits a picture, or a story, or whatever it is in these contests, DON'T say things like "OMG, this person shouldn't win" for whatever reason.... that is up to the giver, not you.    Personally, I don't even play to win, I play for fun, but to have someone sit there and down my work because I have more upvotes then them is just juvenile and should be discouraged here.  We need to all play with good sportsmanship here.  I hope I'm not the only one that feels this way.

t3_m68ww	1320857569.0	MeechPeach	FAP	It's a special Redditor's birthday soon! Help make her smile!	I know this isn't a normal request, but this is such a warm and happy subreddit with amazing people, I know I'll get some additional support here.  We are in the company of an incredible Redditor. She contributes to a bunch of subreddits, this one included. She is very kind and helpful and has been extremely generous and helpful to me.   I was hoping some of you wonderful Redditors could take a few moments to send her some warm Birthday Wishes. I've created an email account for her so we can fill it up with e-cards/notes. The email is KickAssBroad@hotmail.com  I'm sure there are others, but [123greetings](http://www.123greetings.com) is one of the services I used. It's free and doesn't require you "register" or "log in." [egreetings](http://www.egreetings.com) is another great free service. Any other ideas are welcomed too. Even just a quick note wishing her a happy day would be great. After the inbox fills up a bit, I'll PM her with the email address that I created and reveal her identity in this post!  I've posted in other subreddits so my apologies for redundancy. Also apologies if this kind of post isn't allowed.  I've had a few people PM me asking about the identity of the Redditor so they could customize some birthday greetings. That's great too.  Thanks again!!!

t3_m4396	1320707600.0	DEStudent	PIF	(Offer) Will buy a pizza for someone on 11/10 that can help me with a paper tonight... 	Hello:  So this is what I have to write about:  Tina is a 23 year old black female. She is currently separated from her husband of five years. She is currently employed by two companies, one at which she works Monday- Thursday mornings, and the other on Wednesday – Friday evenings, and all day Saturday and Sunday. However, she hasn’t shown up for work on a consistent basis for the last four weeks, and not at all in the last two days.      Once an energetic, active, healthy female who loved to exercise at the local gym three days a week, Tina now spends most of her time in her apartment. She hasn’t been to the gym in over four weeks, and her body movements that used to be quick and marked are now slow and sluggish. Even though she hasn’t changed her eating habits, Tina has been losing weight.      Joe, Tina’s husband, left her for another woman approximately four weeks ago. When she found out, Tina immediately locked herself in her room and cried herself to sleep. That night, she slept for about twelve hours straight, but that was the last time she had a long stretch of true sleep. Since then, Tina’s sleep habits have been very erratic; sometimes she will sleep for a few hours in the day, some in the evening. She finds herself unable to sleep longer than four hours at a time; as a result, she is constantly fatigued.      When she is awake and able to think clearly, which isn’t 100% of the time, Tina is fixated on where she went wrong in her marriage. She feels that if Joe left her for another woman, it must be because she must not be good enough, just like she wasn’t good enough for her own father to stay at home when she was seven…he left her and her mother, so she must not have been good enough back then, either.      Tina thought that when she married Joe right out of high school, it would be so wonderful. She had such great plans for the two of them...they would both work their way through college and be successful. But it didn’t work out that way, and Tina had to work two jobs just to keep food on the table and the rent paid, because Joe felt it more important to hang out with his friends all day long. If only she had worked harder, or been prettier, or sexier. That must be a lot of it, Tina thinks. She isn’t pretty enough, or hard working enough, or good enough, or sexy enough, which is why Joe left her. She was always so tired from working so much, that it was all she could do to crawl in the bed to sleep, much less give Joe the sex he wanted so often.     Tina believes that because of whom she is and what she has done, no one will ever love her and she will never have a relationship again. She keeps saying over and over how worthless she feels, and that her working all the time must have contributed to the downfall of the marriage. The company kept telling her that if she did just a little more, stayed a little longer, worked a little harder, that she would be promoted, which is why she kept pushing herself as she did. Unfortunately, Tina couldn’t balance the roles, and lost her husband as a result. She feels like a failure, and that she will always be a failure at life and at love.      Tina thought that she and Joe had many friends, but when Joe left, the friends stopped calling and coming to visit, leaving her alone with her sadness. Shortly after Joe left, she called a few girlfriends, but they eventually tired of her constant complaining and wanting sympathy and stopped answering her calls. As a result, Tina has no one to talk to. It would have been nice to talk to her sister, but her sister committed suicide four years ago after becoming deeply depressed over a broken relationship. Tina has thought about suicide too, but she isn’t at the point to do anything about it…yet.  **If you've done this paper or can assist me ( A LOT of Assistance needed) I will be more than glad to purchase pizza for you on 11/10. I've seen 2 possible "helps" on a certain website, but I am broke until then and my paper is due by midnight.**  **If you are really great and help me out today and can find the assistance I need (8-10 pages), I will reward you with the equal dollar amount in pizza... ie $25=$25 worth of pizza**  Thank you very much!  Edit: More details: Abnormal Psychology. Read Tina’s story below carefully. Using her story as a guide, write a comprehensive discussion of Major Depressive Disorder.  Use examples from her story to illustrate the important points to know about this disorder. In your discussion, be sure to include the following points:      **How it is described and diagnosed in the multiaxial system, including identifiable symptoms? (Discuss each of the five axes.)     How each theoretical perspective/approach could explain Tina’s behavior and support Tina’s diagnosis?     Which treatments would be recommended according to each theoretical perspective and the related prognosis for recovery?     Social perceptions about the disorder**   **EDIT #2- I'm done for tonight everyone. I am just amazed how many people were so sweet and kind even just wanting to help because. You are too great! Thank you all for caring, I am going to sleep. Thanks again.**	True

Tanyagal2 helped us out!**   Hey, I'm Carrie. I posted a request a few days ago. It was received really well... well enough to get an offer! I'm not entirely sure what happened, but it never was completed. The offerer and I were in contact via private message briefly, but I haven't heard back from him/her about it. I sort of feel like a jerk for telling my fiance and his kids I was getting some pizza for us. I contacted the moderators and they said it was okay to try again.  My original post was actually for my fiance. He just got laid off last week. I was hoping to get some pizza for us because he and his kids were coming over to work on his resume (he has no computer since his ancient one finally kicked the bucket). We got that all figured out and they'll be over again today so we can start emailing it to prospective employers. Money is pretty tight for me since I just paid bills and rent. If there's anyway a generous soul out there could help with dinner, we'd be so appreciative.   We're in New Castle County in Delaware.

t3_m3i89	1320675547.0	black009009		Louis Pizza, (Ottawa) gave me & hubby a free pizza after meeting them at a hospital, visiting our respective families.	[Louis Pizza](http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?cid=7578210253413953656&q=louis+pizza+mcarthur&hl=en&gl=ca&ved=0CBEQ-gswAA&sa=X&ei=keC3TuuFNoGENv2gsK0M) (Google Maps) is our favourite destination for pizza.      Long story short.  We'd been going to Louis for years, mainly for their pizza.  So my insane mother (subtext:52 cats, AMA later) had tried to kiill herself, and my man and I were moping around the hospital waiting for Mom to come around so we could give her shit.    So we're smoking outside, and we see the mother of the Louis family going in.  We know each other so we're like, "You guys ok?  Yeah we're doing this and you're doing that and blah blah hospital stuff.    That evening, at the hospital, the *Father* catches our eye near the entrance, and he's got a small pizza box in his hands.  He approaches us with a comforting smile and offers it to us, free of charge.  The family had *made* that for us specifically, and was hoping to catch us there.    We held back some gracious tears, wondered why anyone would be nice to us, and ate our first good meal in a few days.    This family is kind and considerate, they don't *generally* deliver, but if your near Ottawa in the next few days, order something for pick-up, or stop in for some good eats.  (This is not an ad, just some props for an incredible family who deserves many nice thoughts (and riches).

t3_m3daq	1320658924.0	ThrowawayBegger		(Request) Stuck in Canada, out of money and down on my luck.	Long story short: I am a British student who is now living in Canada and have been the past 11 months. I  recently lost my job at a youth hostel in downtown Toronto (also where I live) and for the past 2 weeks I have struggled desperately to get a replacement job but to no avail. With rent coming, phone bill to pay, and other assortments, I'm stressing. Hard.  I've never had to ask people for handouts, and I really don't know how to go about asking, so I'll just say it.  I would like a pizza Reddit. I have absolutely no cash left and I have barely and food left in my fridge; the past 3 days I have survived on water from the tap, peanuts and microwavable popcorn.  It's a joke, really, and I am ashamed. I have been a long-time lurker and never actually thought I'd create an account solely for this purpose.  Apologies, but help is appreciated.  Proof if required.

A delivery driver was shot and killed while approaching someone stealing from coworkers cars: http://www.wthr.com/story/15957703/pizza-delivery-driver-shot-in-bloomington  I've never been on this subreddit before but I figured this was appropriate to link, and since that location is offering all proceeds to go to the family of the deceased( http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pizza-X/82904137667 ) I figured RAoP might be interested. There is nothing in it for me: I do not know the individual/family of the deceased, but I am from Bloomington and felt like outreach might be appreciated by his surviving family.

On Monday, hours before I was going to visit my family I found out that my grandmother has passed. Out of the blue, I damn well thought the woman had a year or two left. She had lived with my family since before I was born, and was like having a second mother.   Tonight my brother and his fiancé are coming in from Pittsburgh most likely to stay with my girlfriend and myself. Being in my parents house was hard enough for me to take, I couldn't imagine staying there. Thing of it is, we aren't doing so hot in the last couple weeks or the weeks approaching financially. I'm the last one to take handouts, but it is extremely hard for me to do just about anything right now. We could really use your help RAoPer's.   Thank you in advance, because I know there will be a lot of thoughts put out there for me and my family. Reddit has helped me get through the days honestly.

t3_lxzag	1320259690.0	Dont_do_dat	pizza	Papa John's tip..	For those of you who like to order sides with your Papa Johns' pizza, (specifically chicken strips) you can actually get a better deal by ordering two 4pc's @ $3.00ea.   You get an extra chicken strip for free this way since the 7pc is $6.00 (FREE Chicken! Woo!)   Unfortunately this works the opposite way with wings, you actually lose approx. 2 wings by ordering the 4pc's @ $3.00ea as opposed to ordering the 10pc @ $7.00. (Prices vary depending on whether you get unsauced or sauced wings.)  I know this is minor, and probably a bit confusing, but the more food the merrier.  **tl:dr:** You can get an extra chicken strip for free if you order two 4pc's.

Pizza, soup, anything. This would be greatly appreciated. I am one of the people who lost a good job thanks to the poor economy; have been out of work several months.

I'm trying to send someone a pizza as per [this post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/lx271/request_bay_area_hungry_broke/), so I bought her an eGiftCard from Dominos. The problem is that it hasn't reached her yet, and the only invoice I have from Dominos is a 'thank you for your order' email (with an order ID number) that says "We'll be sending you delivery confirmation soon, along with complete order details for your records."  The poor thing must be starving, she asked for this pizza like 5 hours ago. How can I get her her pizza? Maybe I can just buy a second pizza and ask her to send me the gift card when it arrives?  **Update:** I finally just phone-ordered another pizza, but it took trying every major online pizza company and phone-calling two local franchises to find a place that would deliver without requiring the credit card at the delivery. I think it's gonna work now. What an ordeal!	True

t3_lwnbt	1320169852.0	Epicon3	PIF	{Request}   Starvin Marvin in Stevens Point, WI	As many of you may have noticed, I took down my original request from three days ago.  Figured that there were people in the world probably much worse off than myself.  After all, I'm a white guy with two jobs.  Three days later, I'm still here.  Still alive.  I've now had two cans of Mt.Dew and one can of Dr. Pepper, thanks to the gracious coin finds in my couch/hallways/roadside/etc, and the super cheap soda machine down the road.  Calories are important people!  Even empty ones.    Down from #180 to #145.  At 6'2" this can't be healthy.  If this were a diet, I'd be winning.   Ok, now I know what you're thinking... 2 jobs?  White guy?  Why should I help him?  He should be rich!  I could go into a rant about how I gave both of my knees for your freedom.  Perhaps complain about how the unfair system has kept me down by calling me disabled.  Cry about how I lost everything in a messy breakup. etc etc...  That's not me though.    Situation is this: *1.  My jobs are part-time and limited hours. *2.  My house is basically the local homeless shelter (filled with jerks that don't pay/play fair), and even with generous donations from local pantries, the coffers are empty. *3.  Every cent that I get is in the red.  Cost of Living is up, and minimum wage doesn't cover much (rent, electric, etc..)   I'm not asking for a lot.  Anything food related that you could toss my way would be a blessing.  As always, random acts of kindness are paid back & forward.  Thanks for the <3 reddit!  	
t3_lwml9	1320168791.0	menmybabies	menmy	Food for thought regarding new RAoP'ers	Hello Fellow RAoP'ers!  Hope you are all doing well this fine day/night.  I wanted to ask for a minute of your time to help keep RAoP the happy, upbeat and random place that is should be.  Most regulars are aware of the recent coverage done for RAoP.  Those who aren't, our very own Gadianton (creator of the sub along with other mods assistance) Anyhow, Gadianton was just interviewed about RAoP.  The story will soon hit the waves worldwide bringing a mass amount of both new requestors and givers.  Lately, a lot of questioning/name calling has been tossed out at new members.  We all at one point were new to reddit overall.  Granted *you* may not have signed up for a free pizza but, someone else may have because this is the place they heard about and wanted to try out.  Maybe they join, post a request 5 minutes later and then they explore and learn more about reddit..good for them.  Maybe they will only join for pizza, again..good for them.    This story no doubt will bring a growing crowd to our group.  I'd like to ask you all to embrace and make these new members feel welcome.  At the very least, don't make them feel like they are on trail in court.  The story they will see is about an amazing group of people reaching out and giving to others.  We don't want to give off the impression that we don't like/appreciate/accept newbies.  We want everyone to feel welcome to post here as often as their heart desires.  Thats the cool thing, you can post for whatever reason, how ever many times.  Only ask that you be honest and don't delete posts that have been answered.    I understand and respect the *reasoning* for the doubts, questions and concerns.  Believe me I do.  However, not every new member is set out to rip you off for a pizza.  We may get some that aren't on the up and up but, don't allow this to allow you to take it out on or assume this about all members.  I am posting this after speaking with Gadianton about the happenings of late.  This community is a wonderfully awesome place.  I'd hate to see it become a place where everyone and everything is questioned or second guessed.  Sure, you may find reason or suspect something about a member.  Should this happen, please privately take your concerns to our wonderful mods.  Copy the link and send it to them with a quick "hey I think they are ripping people off and *insert proof* *this* is why and allow them to handle it.  We are lucky in the fact that not only our members are awesome, so are our moderators.  This is the type thing they are here for, please bring it to them, allow them to look into it/discuss amongst themselves and do as they see fit on a one by one basis.    If you are a giver who wants to see proof, by all means ask for it.  You want a picture, say so.  Also realize not everyone has the ability to provide pictures and their lack of ability to do so, doesn't make them someone not on the up and up.  Be reasonable, remember there is another human with feelings on the other side of the screen.  Think of how you'd feel if someone said/did something the way you are about to, would you like it? If not, chances are the newbie won't either.    Nobody forces anyones hand in giving.  You give to who you choose for whatever reason you choose.  At the end of the day, if you don't like a repeat requestor, a new member just don't give to those people.  Find someone you *do* want to give to.  No need to call people out or make a person feel uncomfortable about doing just what we as a sub say they can do.  Ask whenever/for whatever.

Can I use them to order pizzas for people here, or is the fact that I'd need the recipient's address just too creepy? (Or is there a way of doing it without the address that I don't know about?)

t3_lw1p0	1320118861.0	directionalpad		Thank you @EmptyAy!	This Halloween was probably the worst I've had. My friend and fellow redditor [Chunkxzor](https://www.reddit.com/user/Chunkxzor) is in the hospital due to his diabetes (he's fine, but still on an insulin IV drip), and my neighborhood is generally filled with people between the ages of 60-65 years old. Needless to say that Halloween isn't actively celebrated around these parts. So for yet another Halloween I was going to sit home and drink myself into oblivion.   I would have gone out a bit more and attempted to party things up, but I've been unemployeed the last few months and am currently sitting on $2.16 in my bank account. I figured at the very least I could ask /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza for a little love and hopefully turn this mediocre/sad Halloween into a some kind of enjoyable affair.  Enter my friend [EmptyAy](http://www.twitter.com/#!/EmptyAy). I was telling him about my situation and how this Halloween has gone when he asked me for my address. I gave it to him and within the hour two delicious pizzas showed up to my doorstep. Although I'm not sure if he's a redditor I would just like to thank him for turning this Halloween into something awesome. He's a really cool guy and has a twitter account located at [http://www.twitter.com/#!/EmptyAy](http://www.twitter.com/#!/EmptyAy). If you use twitter you should give him a follow. He does other acts of random generosity for his followers and he's just an all around cool guy.   Seriously though. Thank you [EmptyAy](http://www.twitter.com/#!/EmptyAy). You made this Halloween great!  **tl;dr**: A friend of mine I met online hooked me up with pizza and made this Halloween pretty epic.  **Edit**: Heres pics of the pizzas [https://twitpic.com/795hvf](https://twitpic.com/795hvf)  **Second Edit**: He now has a reddit account.

t3_lvzek	1320115197.0	ohioriverboatsong258		Kitchener-Waterloo ON area. Lonely and moving out, cleaning all night and could really use a pick-me-up-pie.	I just spent the whole weekend moving out of my apartment because I can't afford it anymore. My new place is more affordable and I'm lucky to have parents and friends who have helped out here and there when necessary. But generally I scrape by at the bare minimum, and the added expenses of moving have really tapped me this month. I give up the keys tomorrow and the place is filthy. I mean really disgustingly filthy. I found out shortly after I moved in that mould in this building is a problem, and I tried to keep on top of it but I've since found it in the corners of certain rooms, and once all my stuff was moved out I found a lot of it in the areas blocked by my furniture. My landlord seems to blame me for it and I know if I don't clean it all up as best I can, he'll make me pay for a cleaner to come in afterwards. Can't even afford to buy rubber gloves for cleaning, and my hands are stinging from a combination of Vim and Javex. My girlfriend is out of town at a training session for her new job, and apparently a bit tipsy and having fun with other people, which is great but makes me feel a bit lonely. I miss her. Have to work early tomorrow so I'm likely to be up until 3 or 4 am cleaning this place before I can finally go to my new home and sleep for an hour or two. I'm quite broke and have no idea what I'm going to do for food tonight. Pizza would be a bit of lovely, and much appreciated.

t3_lvbgs	1320079545.0	Vanetia	shroom	[Reminder] To everyone ordering/receiving pizza tonight	I used to work in a pizza place, so I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that if you want to get a pizza delivered to you at a reasonable time, you'd better call and place your order in advance.  This is the night that is the most busy of the entire year. So much so that they will have every single person on their roster in to work, and they will still end up with a 2+ hour wait time around dinner.  Just a heads up. I'm sure most of you know this, but keep it in mind anyway. Have a wonderful Halloween!

t3_lu03g	1319971424.0	tommybrohama		(request) Been up all night crying, screaming, and now starving. Jacksonville FL.	I'm not new to Reddit and I'm not from Jacksonville either. Sorry but I'm requesting incognito because I don't want anyone I know to find out about what's happening right now. There's a really messed up situation and I haven't even told my dad about this yet, so I don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.  I got a surprise yesterday when a guy I've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! She was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!  After a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!  I'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid. But for today, I need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and I think he would appreciate it too.  Sorry again for being a bit deceptive with my post. If I wasn't starving I wouldn't be spreading it around for that matter either. If anyone can help you have my gratitude.   8:30 AM. Taking a trip out and about, will be back in a few hours to check the thread.  Edit: 5.15 PM-- The generous contribution of another redditor who chooses to remain anonymous (like a boss) has secured dinner for me on this fine evening. I thank the dozens of folks who offered encouragement in thread and through PM as well as the others who flamed and trolled me so diligently. Ripping into you was an awesome way to blow off some steam, so you helped out a lot too. Thanks again to everyone, here's to a brighter future.	True

My husband and I have had our share of ups and downs these past 25 years. But I could not see myself with anyone else. He has been wonderful to myself and our two children and is very much appreciated. I am asking if someone could help with a pizza tonight. We dont have any extra money for a celebration because our beloved cocker spaniel sheba is suffering from a broken leg and the little money we saved to go to Chilis we spent on her recovery. A pizza would be a nice thing for us since we have not eating any in a year now. Any help would be much appreciated. I do have a verification code if needed. Thank you for your time and thanks for reading.	
t3_ltcss	1319910738.0	LouFigs13		Long-time Redditor and injured Occupier could use some pizza.	I never thought it would be necessary for me to reach out to the community in this way, but here goes. I was injured during my time as a brave Occupier of Pensacola, Florida. Unlike my comrades in Oakland and New York, who were battered and scarred by cruel agents of an oppressive regime, my injury was caused by what I believe to have been a spider. While sleeping outdoors for weeks at a time, some sort of an evil insect, possibly under the control of NSA, FBI, DHS or CIA, bit me on my ass and has caused an absolute horror of, what I believe to be, an infection. I am a bicycle riding person, with no food in the house, and very limited cash. I live in 3rd world America, so unless I want to hit the emergency room and owe an ungodly amount of cash to some hospital, I just need to ride this pain out in bed with constant warm compresses and showers. Believe me, this is a pain in the ass I would not wish on anyone, even Mr. JP Morgan himself. Please help me return to the struggle as soon as possible. In return, I offer you constant upvotes and positive comments to all posts you make in the future. Peace friends and have a good Saturday!

Ive given here before and won games here so this is the RAoP my heart has loyalties to....but I made my promise over there. Would it be wrong to pay it forward here? There really is no activity there.  Anyway, I just didnt want my pizza superhero (he really was a hero last night) to go unnoticed and let it be known that I made a request in the midst of my dayquil drunkedness. I get paid next Friday, I shall return then or the day after with an offer for pizza...maybe a game if Im feeling creative.   Thank you to Sparkyvision and I guess to the RAoP doppelganger. 	
t3_lt6l5	1319894713.0	shellymitsy		(REQUEST) Bank ripped off my last $50, could use a pick me up. (McDonough Georgia).	It's 10/30, posted this up yesterday, seems I'm pretty popular on here. Have not got any help yet and would still like a pizza if anyone willing to spare me some.  I'm not exactly a charity case (at least not yet) but I was planning on using that $50 for food, now it's going to a stinking overdraft fee instead. I work part time at a local church doing clean ups every Tuesday and Friday. It's not my main job but it helps out a whole lot. The problem is they pay me with these checks that are uncashable, they have to be deposited into an account. I have an ebanking account with Bank of America, every time I deposit a check I get charged a service fee at the end of the month. Well, guess what hit my bank last night? A couple service fees and an overdraft fee for good measure, just wonderful. So my account went from a positive few cents yesterday to negative $56 dollars today. Even when I put in my check I'll be overdrawn anyway, and if I can't come up with the difference they'll hit me for another $35 in a couple days.  They told me that overdraft protection would stop this kind of thing, but of coarse it doesn't do a thing against their fees so getting them removed isn't happening. I'm just glad I filled up my car the other night or I wouldn't have wheels next week. I get paid next Friday and thankfully my Mom is gonna send me some money in a couple days but I'm empty stomached between now and then. Would anybody mind tossing a pizza and some soda my way to tide me over? You'd earn a spot in my prayers tomorrow for sure. I'm just tired of life dumping on me, so if anyone would cut me a break I'd love you forever.	True

If you (or your giftee) tries to use a giftcard and gets this message:   "Papa John's (or Domino's, or whatever) could not receive authorization for the gift card used during this transaction.

We've been going through REALLY hard times of late, and earlier this week my partner and I had the horrible sinking realization that we were both incredibly broke, and that our anniversary is Monday. CompletelyLurker awarded me the e-gift card, and because of that awesome kindness the BF and I can now actually have a nice little anniversary weekend with a pizza and gaming versus just ramen or rice dishes - it means a hell of a lot, and it makes us feel very special that someone would do this for us.   Maybe as soon as Murphy's Law stops favoring us, we will be able to return the favor for some other redditor (I hope soon :( )   But thank you CompletelyLurker! You're amazing!

t3_ls1hs	1319794497.0	pdnick		Stunned by a Random_Act_Of_Dinner from a total stranger...	So it was payday today and I like to try and take the girlfriend and her daughters out to dinner if there’s going to be a little money left over from the bills and what-not (She’s got three awesome little girls -10,9,5 - from her previous marriage) We take a drive down to Chase’s Diner and get in a nice filling meal for everyone involved. As we’re finishing up the waitress comes over and says “Whenever you guys are ready to leave you can take off, someone covered your bill for you…” I was stunned and honestly a little confused. I asked her if she was serious and why they did it. Still in shock, I’ve never had that kind of upfront generosity from a total stranger. She said that they told her we looked like a nice family with very well mannered kids and that she wasn’t supposed to say anything until after they left. The GF and I were totally overjoyed and plan to pass the kindness onward soon. We used the money that I would of used on dinner for a nice tip for the waitress and some Halloween goodies for the girls. Thank you kind strangers, there still is random kindness out there…   P.S. I know that this doesn’t involve sending pizza in any way but I think it totally keeps in the spirit of r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza   TLDR: Strangers bought our meal!

t3_lrpbe	1319766817.0	Jalut	shroom	The Poor College Student Blues	Hey guys, I moved to a new city on a whim and am suffering greatly for it. First week I ate ramen, now I've moved up to a diet consisting of rice, bread, and oats. Lunch meat when I'm lucky. Haven't found a job yet and my loans barely cover rent, I'm told this is the place to go for a pizza if you're intent on giving back when you can. It would be awesome not to eat any more from my current diet for just a day.

t3_lrfr6	1319751194.0	sarahjo10	shroom	(Request) Would LOVE some pizza! 	So I've been really broke the past few weeks, like.. 'sell really cool things you have on ebay just to pay for gas' type of broke. Only to find out ebay/paypal whatever, is putting a 21 hold on funds now - so I sold some really cool stuff and it didn't even help, eek! To make this story even better - I had hardly any money for groceries this week so I bought that really cheap meat with all the pearly white fat chunks (gross) and decided to make chili and stretch. Usually I buy canned chili beans but the ones in the bag were cheaper - never used the bag kind before. Well I'm not the best cook, read the directions wrong and to make a long story short.. I've been eating gross fatty chili with rock hard kidney beans for the last 2 days :(   yes I doooo have a mushroom already, I know I know. I had a totally awesome pizza hero back in August help me gain a little weight after a terrible experience on the baby food diet just so I could fit into a gross 80's style dress for a wedding that had a cash bar! If my pizza hero hadn't had a girlfriend, I probably would have married him.

I found out I have a huge bonus coming to me later this week or early next week. I'll be able to go grocery shopping, pay all the bills, life is steadily getting better. I've received on here before once, I came back last week when we ran out of food and help was offered to me. They lived outside the country and couldn't complete the order sadly.  Right now I'm ashamed to say my kids are living off the free lunch they get from school and a few odds and ends here at home. We haven't had a proper meal in this house for days. My husband and I have been eating a can of tuna and a cup of noodles every day for the last couple days, we could really use a meal here.

Our car broke down and is now costing me an arm and a leg. My brother is doing the work, but I still have to pay for the parts. Our dryer broke and I've been drying them outside but it got colder out. I'm going to get one off of Craigslist on Sunday, but it's still cash out of my pocket. I can't show a picture of the car (it's in the shop), but I can show you the laundry hanging from our ceiling in the basement. Anything that anyone can do for us would be so appreciated.

I'm sorry this is so late, my dear; I've been trying to get the pictures of the enormous amount of food I sent my friends off my phone. Alas, since I dropped my smartphone plan, this hasn't happened...and there's no way to make it happen.   BUT I sent them Three pizzas A pasta bowl A sandwich FOUR lava cakes and a 2 liter Sprite.   So I just wanted to thank you publicly for offering to help when I mostly got downvotes on my post - they almost cried with happiness. They hadn't been focusing on eating and had forgotten to do so (like I figured), and they're both single men so of course they absolutely adored the load of delicious junk I sent them. I even got the pizza guy to write "Condolences from RAOP" on the boxes. Matt and Tray loved it.   Thank you in spades -- your heart is made of gold.	
t3_lne0i	1319481635.0	PastafarianTwit	FSM	I'm baaaack!  (Well, sort of)	I know this isn't really pizza related, but meh.  As a lot of you wonderful people know, I went under for surgery a little less than a week ago, so I haven't really been around much lately.  You've probably seen me luring a little bit the last couple days as I've been starting to feel better.  I've been avoiding doing much in my mod capacities on purpose in an effort to avoid any unneeded stress, and I will probably still lay low for a couple more days.  Yes, you guys are a wonderful community and I love this place a lot, but... being a mod does become stressful every once in awhile and I just don't need that right now. =)  For those interested in what I had done, it was actually a total of 4 procedures to hopefully cure my sleep apnea:  * Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (which basically removes all excess soft tissue in the back of your throat that they can),  * Septoplasty (which fixed my deviated septum),  * submucosal resection (which removes some bone from below overactive turbinates, which are the things that run along your sinus passage to moisten the air and produce mucous), *  and Plasma generator turbinate reduction (which basically kills excess soft tissue in the turbinates).  As far as how it all went, the doctor was very optimistic that it will solve my problems.  He actually let me out after the surgery, which is pretty rare.  Before the procedure they were even talking about maybe having me spend a night in ICU.  So that all went well, I'm on the heal, but it hurts like hell to swallow anything, anything at all.  The codeine that I was on wasn't cutting it for the pain(I woke up at 6am in tears because it was so bad), so I just got switched to percocet which is much better so far and I actually ate some fried rice today!  I've been living on almost a 1000 cal/day diet, and dropping weight like crazy.  That's about all, if you have any questions about this crap, AMA, but I'll be back to modding later this week.

t3_ln731	1319470686.0	dolpgrl	shroom	Help a family whose mom has cancer in Houston, TX 77043	Hi, my sister-in-law has been fighting the battle of her life with breast cancer. She had a mastectomy in July, and then started chemo. The chemo is really taking a toll on her and she is losing massive amounts of blood. She has to go to the hospital at least once a week to get blood transfusions. My brother (her husband) lost his job as a result of having to take her to her appointments and hospital visits. She has been missing work because of being so sick. So, needless to say, they truly don't have much food. They have 2 daughters, that I know would really appreciate having some pizza. I would help, but I am currently unemployed myself and would love to have pizza, too. But I think it's most important for them. Please if anyone can help, we'd really appreciate it.

He recently went to a couple of pizza birthday parties and I guess now assumes you have pizza for your birthday! Payday is not until a week from today, so Pizza is not in the budget for this week. I will provide pictures of my birthday boy with his pizza if his pizza request is granted! We are a family of 5 and have a Pizza hut nearby. Thanks for reading!!

t3_lmy9r	1319447419.0	6whiteboomers		[potential request] pizza for an Aussie 	Hey RAoP  This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.  First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give.   I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)  Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling.   What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days.   I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P  But thanks for reading anyway, RAoP!  Also, please and thank you ;)	True

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Pizza or any food! (In response to the rude Redditor who responded to my last post - yes I did receive a pizza back from someone back in May - but we are allowed multiple requests here.

Now we have stuffes, sore stomachs, and are about to fall asleep. This is a favor I will most definitely pay forward. It's nice to have some faith restored back into society, and others deserve to feel the same.  I found a promo code for Papa John's to get the most out of the deal.

t3_lm3j1	1319386363.0	TheGoodEarth	shroom	This place is amazing. Thank you to all the givers.	As a reader of Reddit for six months or so and a "member" for less than a month, I have to say what a wonderful community this is and how thankful I am to ALL those who contribute to it.  Like many others, I entered the working force at age 15 and have yet to be unemployed until this past Friday. I worked for a local bank, but then it expanded. I moved to another "local" bank last year with promises of opportunities for growth and security. I was laid off on Friday. It's the plight of 31 million other Americans. We study and we work and we save and then shit happens. I can sit here all day and blame others and even myself, but shit happens. We're given ample opportunity to thrive here, and we even have safety nets that others just aren't ever afforded, but we are given more than plenty of chances to sink or swim.   And now, I enter the unemployed population more scared than I'd like to admit. Scared of failure, scared that I won't be able to provide for my family, scared I'll drown in a pool of my own debt and scared I'll become a number that we consider the "greedy lazy looking for handouts."  My fears are comforted though. Comforted by those who have been where I am and now have success stories. I also find comfort in knowing my fate if I give in to feeling sorry for myself and my situation. The comfort I found most recently was those so readily willing, for whatever their reason, to help complete strangers. There are a thousand adjectives that don't do this kind acts justice. It leaves me speechless and brings tears to a grown man's eyes.  There's really no point to this post other than it being another "thank you" to everyone that contributes here. Not just the givers, but those that offer sympathetic words of support and encouragement and those that "pay it forward" be it in pizza or some other random act.  Matt_and_Chelle reached out yesterday offering to help us with "staples" next week and are even making room for us at their upcoming yard sale. iRedditAlot provided us with a very generous gift card to a local pizza shop. Not in a million years would I have ever expected this. The gestures themselves, getting pantry items and food, are things we don't think much about at the time. The fact that others think to do things like that is the true "act of kindness" that "restores one's faith in humanity."  Thank you to every single one of you.

I spent all week biting my nails watching people get laid off and the on Friday, I got the boot too. (Why do they always wait until FRIDAY?!) We were living on a tight budget since my wife's hours got cut, and now, I have no clue what to do. I've got two appointments with a temp agency on Monday and also plan on going to the Unemployment office (I hear it's bad, if not worse, than the DMV) for the first time in my life. A buddy of mine got me a part-time job delivering pizza but I can't start that until after Halloween.   I hope someone out there can give us a hand here in Delaware. This is a little bump in the road, but it still sucks. Pizza would really lift our moods. Thank you!

I have some other things going on, but the main one at the moment is a recent injury. I busted up my foot pretty good when we were picking out pumpkins last night. I can't afford the ER so I have to wait until the clinic opens on Monday. I don't think anything is broken, but it's still hurts and is making everything a chore. I was sent home from work today so I'm already losing money on my paycheck. I don't know how many more days I'll be out. But I was wondering if anyone could give me a hand with some pizza today. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks to all for looking at this. Have a nice weekend.

My supervisor told me he'd write me a recommendation letter for a lesser-paying job in another branch, but I think others will be heading there in search of work too. My wife's hours at work have gradually been cut in half which had us on a budget to begin with. Now... I'm not even sure. I've got an appointment at two temp agencies on Monday. A friend of mine said he could get me a job delivering pizzas, but that's not the most reliable of income and I couldn't start for another week or so. If anyone could help us out with some pizza, we'd be so appreciative. It'd be a nice boost in morale and well, just delicious. We haven't had any pizza other than Elio's (does that even count as pizza?) in the past few months. I know a lot of people have it hard right now but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.

t3_lkdh6	1319231962.0	ieatfoodsometimes		{Requesting} Not for me, for a friend in Georgia	I can't believe I never found Reddit before today, I've been wasting my life on 4chan -_- Things are a lot more awesome here.  So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.  I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.  He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.  He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.  Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?  I don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.

t3_lkc2y	1319229603.0	kennstep		Lung Cancer Stage 4 would like to share a pizza with girlfriend. 	My boyfriend, Doug has Stage 4 lung cancer. It started in the lung, spread to the lymph nodes and finally to the brain. The chances of surviving all this is less than 2 percent (for a 3 year survival rate). He has completed 15 days of radiation and is going to start chemo in one month. he has short term memory loss (from the radiation) and minor hair loss. Because of the cancer his left side of the body is paralyzed. In addition to every thing else, he had to have emergency colon surgery September 19-20 and has 2 ostomy bags. He cannot go home, so he is living in a nursing home and getting rehab to hopefully regain use of his left arm and leg. (the right side of the body is fine). In the past 6 months he has had 5 surgeries, and spent almost all of the summer and early fall either in the hospital and or nursing home. He would love to have a pizza and I send this request because I would love to have a pizza dinner with him, since taking him out to a restaurant is almost impossible. There is more to his medical story if one needs to ask. I hope someone will be kind enough to help. Thank you in advance. If you are interested in helping please send me an e-mail message at: kennstep@yahoo.com

Edit: My original post http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/li2ku/request_for_dinner_for_just_one_night_fibro/	
t3_ljvgd	1319202554.0	toncinap	PIF	(Request for friends) One of my friends I played D&D with in college committed suicide yesterday.	I know this is one of those weird-looking requests, but honestly I'm not worried about that right now...I'm still in utter shock and surprise. He was only 25, everyone. He was 25.   ...Though I'm not interested in pizza right now, I can't afford to send my pair of friends a pizza or two. They were really close to this friend (his name was Brian) and still live in the same state as him, Ohio. I'm stuck in California right now and I can't even hug them. I can't do anything. Usually I would make a casserole and take it over and offer my love, but I can't. I'm 2,600 miles away.  So here's my reach out to a great community...I was hoping someone might be able to send them a pizza or two, just as a "the world is not as lonely as it feels right now" kind of thing. I currently don't have their address (working on it; should have it after work), and I have to go to work soon here, so I probably won't be around until four or five my time (Pacific time). I make a request now so it has all day. I might have access to Reddit at my job, however, so I'll try to answer you then if not just after work. I'd prefer you send it to their address since it contributes to the whole community thing, but if you can only send a gift card, that's okay too, I'll order a pizza for them. They have a Domino's nearby.   Whether you decide to give or not to them, thank you for being here with your kindness. Just posting this makes me tear up a little because it makes me think of all the wonderful people who have given from the bottom of their empty wallets. Also, if you would like to send a card or something, let me know, since they don't get mail at their address, they have to have a PO box.   I'm sorry if this isn't appropriate; I'll take it down if it's not.  Thank you, again. I can't believe he's gone. 	
t3_ljlpk	1319173466.0	rwheeler720	FAP	QUESTION: Please read this.	Is it wrong for people who have recieved a pizza before, even 2 or 3 times in their past, **ENTER CONTESTS** for a pizza?  There's a reddiotor named "dontfallforit" whose account is 4 hours old, going on every r/R_A_O_P and /r/randomkindess post that they see and trying to guilt people who have recieved ANYTHING.  I don't think this is right. What do you guys think?	
t3_ljk9d	1319170536.0	sabresandbills		(Request) College student with no money, very hungry studying for midterm	My mom was recently in a car accident, and she's been having shoulder/neck/back problems that she has to get MRI's done for and she has to visit her doctor frequently. My parents usually supply me with some money when they can, but I rejected their offer this time because their $20 copays are piling up and they barely have any food in the cupboards themselves, so they need the money much more than I do. This is my first post on here, and I realize there may be people that need food much more than I do, so please help them first. Pizza would last me a few days. God bless. 	
t3_ljjug	1319169803.0	BOTW	pizza-gold	Early departure of Friday's weekly flight #3 - College student pizza to be drawn Friday afternoon.	OK, it's (almost) Friday again. Here's my tenth weekly offer. I'm doing this a few hours earlier than usual, because I will be out of the computer loop on Friday morning, when I usually post this offer. But the deadline time is still the same... your name must be submitted by Friday at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings Time).   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must be able to count to...um...one. In any language you want.   4) You must either reply or PM me that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ---------------------------  [And the winner is:  ThisIsCJFool](http://i.imgur.com/WvqnE.jpg) - who has asked for a Domino's gift certificate. It's on the way, CJ!	True

t3_lhjci	1319036872.0	alicekobett		(Request) Took a personal day, could really use a pizza. Forest Park GA.	I tried posting on here last night but it doesn't look like my post made it onto the site. Rather than write it all out again I'll sum it up as best I can.  My hubby of nearly ten years spent the money my mother gave us for food on beer and cigarettes, so since last night he's been booted out of the house by yours truly. Not sure when I'll let him back in but I intend to stay mad for quite a while. It got down into the 40's last night so I reckon he's definitely regretting his decision about now.  Thankfully he at least got food for the dog so that's one less thing to worry about, but I don't get paid until Monday and that money was supposed to help us make it to then. Right now my fridge is barren, all I have is half a jar of really old pickles.  I ended up taking the day off work today. I'm hungry, angry, upset, not really good for much of anything. I need something to eat, hopefully something that will last a day or two or three. Monday is quite a ways to go without something in my stomach.

But I am glad you did!  I literally devoured an entire pizza, and your post and generousity really inspired me.  Post went something like this!  I just read garbage on "ASSISTANCE" and I need to give away pizza ASAP.    She said she would give pizza to the first 3 who responded, I responded fourth and she gave me a pizza calling it a "tie".    SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO GIVE ANOTHER PIZZA TO THE FIFTH PERSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   You are an absolute guardian angel, I am very sorry I did not post picture - I have no means to do so.  You are just so awesome, I was feeling so terrible that day, was laying around in bed all day, and I got the motivation from that pizza to get out and enjoy life.  The pizza gave me much more that just a full tummy, I can promise you that.

t3_lfrvz	1318899790.0	ninjaliwa	pizza-gold	I'm feeling really disillusioned right now.	Warning: possibly nonsensical rant ahead.  My inbox is full of receipts from Papa Johns and Dominos and Pizza Hut, my bank account now has an impressive collection of foreign transaction fees, and I remember most of the people I've helped out.  RAOP is one of the first things I check every day. I'm seeing 2nd, 3rd, 4th repeat requests from people whose usernames I recognise, who told me when I was buying them pizza that it was definitely a one-off thing, they were going to pay it forward next week after their next paycheque, blah blah blah whatever I know now that it was all bullshit.   I see requests and posts deleted after they've been fulfilled (by me and by others), and the same people requesting again after a week. And then there's the people who delete their accounts straight after receiving pizza, and are probably back now as one of the plethora of new accounts requesting every day.  I've spent so much time getting emotionally invested in sob stories that I thought were true. I've always seen RAOP as a temporary thing, a pick-me-up for people in a spot of trouble or who are feeling down. This is not a food bank but it's being treated as one, and what's more people are lying about treating it as one, and I'm not sure I want to be part of it anymore.  Just wanted to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading.

I made an additional offer for the sake of making it more fun, and I'm making sure to follow-through:  This is the thread to vote on the 2-3 toppings you think are worth trying on my first pie, in the classical redditradition.   No, I won't consider the completely absurd/health dangerous stuff.  I'm not about to try insects on it, and I also request no seafood, as I'm allergic to some (and hate the rest), but those are really the major limitations.  There's no reason to be mouth RAOPists D:    If you've ever wondered about whether some left field food that you like normally would make a hell of a pizza topping, and didn't want to waste time trying it out, this is your chance!  Not sure when I'll have the book done and the ingredients together, but better now than never.  *edit* I'm glad I'm getting a response, but I should clarify:  you don't have to name both toppings.  It doesn't hurt, since I'll be able to mix a 2 topping post and a 1 topping post if both are voted up, but a combination of two isn't necessary for suggestions.  That said, some of these combinations sound awesome regardless.	True
t3_lf6lb	1318864864.0	timknights63		/request/ Centerville, OHIO	I just need some pizza right now im home sick from school with a sore throat, im starving, we have nothing in the house and im fresh out of money. Preferred is Cassanos bacon and green peppers, but anything would be perfect. Thank You 	
t3_lf682	1318864224.0	badbrownie	brownie	Gotcha, you scamming scumbag.  That's one trick that won't work on me again.	I got man-in-the-middle scammed.  Someone trying to take advantage of northernInfinity's plight and snag their pizza signed up as a redditor called northemInfinity and it slipped past me.  I sent the scumbag a $25 gift certificate for papajohns.  Luckily it all happened after Dominos was closed and I got to them before the giftcode was used.   So - now it won't work and there's another trick that I won't fall for again.    Of course, shame on me for falling for the top most scam mentioned on the Don't Fall For Scams page.  But I win this round - in the end.  EDIT:  For fun, this is the email I sent to the giftcard people...  Hi,  I got scammed by someone and sent this giftcard to the wrong person.  Take a moment and see if you can appreciate how annoying this is and help me stop the thieving little bastard from getting away with it.    I'm a part of the Reddit community called Random_acts_of_pizza.  You can find it here  www.reddit.com/r/random_acts_of_pizza  It's a lovely little community that gives away pizzas to people.  Sometimes because they need them and sometimes just for fun.  I myself have purchased about 15 $25 gift certificates from you guys.  In fact, I only ever give away PapaJohns/Dominos/PizzaHut pizza because I can just give them your eGiftCard.  Check xxxxxxx@xxxxx.com as one of your regular customers.  So - this guy made a post and I offered him a pizza:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/leogq/request_havent_eaten_in_36_hours_got_six_bucks_in/  So (if you can go to the link) you'll see that I told him to send me a message with his email and preference of pizza and that I'd send him a gift card.  That's when the scammer stepped in.  He created a new account with a username Very Similar to the person making the post and he sent me a private message with that email address in the hope that I wouldn't notice the difference in the username and that I'd send Him the gift card instead of the needy person.  What an utter ass, eh?  Well, it worked! :(    I Did send him the gift card.  THIS gift card.  And now I'm hoping that you'll rescind it and foil his evil plan.  Maybe give me a new gift card number as a replacement that I can donate to someone worthy.  If you do this then I'll be sure to mention how you helped foil this nasty little thief.  But here's the thing.  He may have already spent it (in which case I'm screwed).  But if he hasn't then he's likely to spend it very soon.  So - if he hasn't spent it yet, please cancel it so that I can give it to someone worthy.  Thank you! 	True
t3_lf4qt	1318861136.0	TheGoodEarth	shroom	Pizza for us in Delaware	Shitty week all around. They're laying off people in my department and I'm scared. I'm the newest and the lowest on the totem pole. My wife's hours just got cut and her asthma has been bothering her something fierce. My brother has been staying with me since he left his wife for cheating on him. He contributes where he can, but divorces are horrible and expensive. We've been living on a fixed budget, and now, we're somehow going to have to start saving.  I don't have much to offer, but I'll be happy to pay someone back if they can help us out. Pizza may not solve all our problems, but it'll make it a much better night.

I have a slow leak on one of my tires that I have to fill about every 3 days, so all my quarters are gone.  I sleep in the laundry/office room of a close friend nice enough to take me in. Though, he says ill have to move out soon. I was lucky to be able to fit my bed in here. That, my car, and this laptop are about all I have. I have decided tomorrow to use my last 2 bucks on gas so I can go by the local fast food and gas stations to apply for work.   I have never felt closer to being homeless than I do now, and it scares the shit out of me.  So a pizza would be awesome to both silence my stomach and lift my spirits.   thanks   EDIT: Thank you bushfuzz01. you are the awesomest! once im back on my feet ill pizza this forward.	True

I ran out of stuff to sell, owe 2 different friends a lot of money, and am in desperate need of food. I rode a bus and walked the rest of the way to a local food bank, they said I needed an appointment. Called to make one, they aren't taking appointments right now, WTF.  So a little while ago I dialed 211 and tried the United Way, they helped my mom a lot when I was little. She got abuse counseling, food, clothes, utilities, everything practically free from them. I told them straight up, I ain't got a car, their exact words were none of my local banks deliver, thanks for calling, click. I called back three times and every time they keep sending me to the same place that already told me no.  Reddit you're my last hope. I saw the story a few months back, didn't need it then but I need it now. When United Way gives you the shaft you know it's bad. If I gotta walk five miles to get it I'll do it, I don't need the exercise but I need food. I feel like I've been walking the desert for a minute and ten hours. Hope there's some love flowing through here today for me. Peace.   Forgot to mention I'm in Jacksonville, Florida.	True

My husband and I haven't had alot of money coming in, he's been driving me all over hell and high water and of course gas is expensive. I'm 7 months in, to his credit, he has been pretty good about my cravings, even getting up at 3 AM to make a taco run (of course he ate more of them than I did). Today I have been craving a cheese pizza with a little barbecue sauce on the side like crazy. With my families budget, we just don't have enough to buy a pizza. And I hate to say it, but I'm in full bitch mode. Not just for me, but for his sake can anyone help us out? I know I've been giving him hell all day. I haven't seen him in a while, I think I scared him off the last time. I know he's in there wrapping pennies, but there's no way there's enough. I'm in Springfield, MA.	True

He's decided to drop out of college and pursue his life-long dream of becoming a turtle, if accepted by Master Splinter.  To understand the importance of this to him, you must first realize that this was a child who, for a period of his life, wore only Ninja Turtle shorts, Ninja Turtle T-Shirts, Ninja Turtle shoes/sandals; Ninja Turtle socks; Ninja Turtle sunglasses; Ninja Turtle caps, Ninja Turtle fanny-pack; Ninja Turtle pajamas; Ninja Turtle "pizza" underwear and last, but not least, dried himself with a Ninja Turtle towel.

If we're creative enough, we may even be able to create our own pizza show pilot ideas! :)  I will also be paying this forward as I get paid bi-weekly this wednesday (direct deposit), so feel free to trade for a pizza in a few days + a drawing, or I can just pay it forward on my own.

I love this subreddit and don't really want to ask for a pizza for me because I feel like it would go against the point of this subreddit so I'm asking for pizza for a friend.  My roommate Matt has been studying for some anatomy test for the past week and is incredibly frustrated and not even taking time to make himself dinner, so is there a friendly redditor who would like to help feed him?   I have no idea how to prove this is for him and not me but if you want proof and can think of a way I will do it for you.   On a side note our landlord who previously told us it would be okay to get a dog changed his mind and told Matt he would have to pay an extra 50 a month for rent and pay a $500  deposit and he told him when Matt was AT the Miami animal shelter which really sucks. We picked out an awesome lab/German shephard that we were going to provide a home for. This whole part is completely unrelated and I just wanted to say it.  Anyway if you want to help my roommate feel better about studying and give him a pizza I will be on this subreddit Monday when I get paid and will return the favor to a willing fellow redditor!!  Thanks guys   Ryan

My coworkers are ten years younger than me or thirty years older than me, it's embarrassing.  So anyway, food pantry doesn't open until 10 on Sunday, I got tap water until then.

I just came from having lunch with my twisted sista, and she seems really, really sincere about burying the hatchet  (she promises this time not in my back) and being there for each other, you know, soul sisters, I've got your back, "defying gravity," yada, yada, and so on and so forth...BTW, lunch was devine.  The munchkins fixed this salad that....oh, sorry to digress. Oh, which brings me to "Condition Number 1":  You must have an  abundance of patience for this offer and "Condition Number 2":  You must be able to personally pick up your za from Dominos.  Anyway, as I was saying ad naseum, she wants us to be friends again.   Please listen to the video 'cause it will help explain everything.  Anyway, dear people:  What say you?  Does she deserve another chance?  Should I trust her "yet again"?  Tell me in 50 words or less what you believe her message is, not only to me, but to humanity, in general.  Now you wonder why you need patience?  Well, I was cleaning out my pink bubble last night and happened upon 8  --you read that right -- Dominos codes anywhere from .49 on up totaling over $25.00.  So, those who submit responses to my query will have to be very "patient" while the cashier at Dominos rings in 8 different coupon codes; but the reward is a feast, I say!!  Let the submissions begin  :)  Cut-off time is 10:00 Eastern Time.    EDIT:  Winner is worriedgrandma.	True

t3_lc2gp	1318602147.0	MamasBabiesx5	PIF	(REQUEST) Birthday Pizza For 2 Children on Oct 31st!	Two of my children have a birthday on Oct 31st. CJ will be 11 (he is my oldest) and Madison will be 2 (she is my youngest). It has been family tradition since CJ was born to have pizza and cake on their birthday. The past few months have been incredibly tough on us, and there is just no way we can fulfill the tradition this month for the birthday children. Is there anyone who would be willing to give a gift card for Papa Johns for the 2 birthday children, so we can continue our family tradition?  -- I also wanted to let it be known I DID recieve a $20 gift card to Papa Johns on Sept 25th for my son, Austin's, 9th birthday, on Oct 4th! Yes, I have 3 children with October birthdays, and its very difficult to keep ahead, especially with the Christmas holiday 2 months later!! :)  -- I have no problem providing verification, in any way you would like, as well. I can even scan a copy of birth certificates (although I do not have a copy of Madison's, I can provide other proof for her if need be!)

Being that I will actually and finally be able to give back at some time, because of people like that, it makes me not want to give in fear of it being one of the same people who tries to tell me that I don't deserve a pizza might be under another handle and getting a free pizza from me. I really wish people would find lives of their own and stop keeping track of others' lives.

t3_l9lzd	1318431916.0	APep06		Tough Year	I would like to request a pizza for my brother. He has had a really tough year. His soon to be ex-wife got a DUI, which cleaned out all of his savings to pay for legal and court fees. Then, she decided she didn't want to be married any more and left him. He can't afford the house anymore, and is looking at foreclosure. He drives over an hour each way for work and barely has enough money for gas or groceries. Oh yeah, and as he was leaving work one day, some 19 year old girl ran into him, totaled his car. He got whiplash and 2nd degree burns from the airbag exploding.  I think you could write a country song out of what he has gone through in the last year, which totally deserves at least one pizza!!

t3_l85q7	1318330198.0	tbfallout		{REQUEST} Will fashion cool stories (bro) for chow in GA	The Infinite Well of Ramen Noodles has run dry. The villagers were greedy, dipping too often into it with the ladle and tongs. Now the children shall starve... unless we can feed them another way?  For a nominal fee of providing edible sustenance that doesn't slurp when I eat it, I shall impart stories of epic proportions based on the whims of the provider. In other words I'll draft a short story based on whatever meaningful or outright ridiculous crap you come up with. Am I any good at writing? Well, I won a Presidential writing award in third grade for an essay I did. I also helped ghost write 2 published works, one of which is in it's fourth printing. The other one was just a paycheck, that lady never stood a chance from the beginning.  The genre is up to you, I can write anything fiction without much trouble. If you want Optimus Prime to viciously beat Rainbow Brite with a broken Buzz Lightyear doll, I'll assemble the necessary back story =). All created works are royalty free, so turn em in to short story contests, publish them in a magazine, whatever.  I am hoping for at least $25 dollars worth of food, I can toss together a good read for that much, and I can eat a couple days off that. But longevity wise I need food for the rest of the week, so the more you donate the longer it'll be. Offer is open to anyone and I will accept up to 3 requests for stories, just make sure if you want something "romantic" that it's tasteful or I'll be inclined to turn it down.  That is all, hope I can snag a few jobs and keep the fridge full for a few days, thanks in advance guys =)

t3_l7tdm	1318300899.0	Lynxx		(request) been eating nothing but rice for a week	The title basically sums it up. I'm not looking for pity, just a helping hand. I'm a college student and I work part time at a decent job, but things are rough right now.     I've been paying my own bills since I was 17 or so, and have garnered a great deal of respect for the life of the working adult over the past couple of years. You never really appreciate the basics until you realize how much they actually cost. I'm currently putting myself through college while paying every bill that comes my way, so as expected, things are naturally tight. But a couple days ago my car broke down and after paying my internet bill (which was a necessity, since I work from home) I don't even have $1.00 to my name.  I'm not going to be broke forever, but my girlfriend and I are getting really burned out eating rice and ramen. A pizza would be much appreciated and would also be great surprise for my lady when she gets home in the morning (she's been 12 hour night shifts non-stop to help pay our bills, and finance a vacation that we have planned next month)  edit: I'm located in Nevada, USA.

t3_l7srw	1318299606.0	HorseIsHypnotist	FAP	Nephew broke his back and had surgery, family is stuck hours from home and broke. They need a pizza. 	Monday my nephew fell and broke his back. My sister's family is poor and is now several hours from home sleeping in his hospital room (Vanderbilt Hospital, Nashville TN). They will be there several more days, since he had surgery today. They don't have much money for food and the rest of my family, myself included, is pretty broke now too. I think they could really use a pizza.

t3_l7cxz	1318273257.0	jamesboyan79		{REQUEST} Broke and hungry in the 305 (South FL)	Instead of eating food I've been playing Borderlands on OnLive most of the day for the past 2 days. I'm completely out of food, I got a cup of flour but that isn't even enough to bother with. I've been unemployed since March, turned down for every kind of assistance I applied for, and a few weeks back they closed the one food pantry nearby I was getting what little I could from.   Somebody I grouped with earlier killing told me to look this place up, see if I'm lucky enough to score some eats. I've been cutting lawns, doing the flea market thing, but I am tapped and have no idea when I'm gonna get anything else in. People ain't buying like they used to so even Craigslist and Ebay failed me.  Please, I need something to eat. I'm on my second play through for this character I started yesterday and I can't keep ignoring the stomach for long. Orange drops or not, Borderlands is not a substitute for edibles.	
t3_l7786	1318264666.0	menmybabies	menmy	Requesting a minute of your time for our SarTim please! :)	In case some of you aren't aware, SarTims beloved Mickey (family dog) passed away last Wednesday.  I had the honor of meeting her and her son this past Friday.  We spent the afternoon together.    She has not been online in a few days now.  She needed a little space to cope with the loss and grieve for her beloved Mickey.    I am asking for each of you to take a minute out of your day and post a comment for her showing her love and support.  If you pray/believe, prayers are welcomed as well.    I know this isn't an offer nor is it a pizza request.  This is a highly regarded member of our RAoP group who I know would smile and be cheered if she knew others were thinking of her and her family during this difficult time.  Please post uplifting, supportive messages to this page.  I'd like for her to be surprised and feel as special as she truly is upon her return.  If you have nothing nice to say please pass it up.  If you don't believe in praying, no problem but, keep the comments and snide remarks to yourself.  Likewise, if you feel this is stupid because it is "just a pet" again, refrain from commenting.  Just a page full of love for one of our respected members is all I am asking.  Who can help!? :) :)

I walked out and later divorced an alcoholic husband and am now living with a boyfriend. I work a crappy job for $8.50 an hour and due to the economy, my hours are cut to 24-28 a week. I owe my boyfriend 9 months of rent, but due to 2 recent surgeries, auto repair, and emergency root canal, I am looking for any way possible I can stretch my $320 two week paychecks out. (My boyfriend is on the road 85% of the year and asking him for money is out of the question). Any leads would be great! I do get $16 food assistance from the state, and I'm a great cook, so I will even take cheap ingredient recipes!  edit: I am also open to any suggestions for living cheaper as well. Right now, I rarely turn on lights and burn candles. I walk or bike 7 miles to the grocery store when it is nice. I go fishing instead of buying it. I am budgeting myself to make every meal less than $2. I don't go shopping except for food. I am trying to sell anything I own for extra cash (plasma is out until I am cleared by the doctor). I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel right now. Payday is next week and I have $12 left. enlighten me fellow redditors!	True

Thank you sir, you're a great person. I also wanted to say thanks to capitalb620, who incredibly offered to donate a Wii console and an Xbox 360 he no longer used to my family, and even drove the 30 minutes or so to drop them off to us.

t3_l4ca6	1318010142.0	burke_no_sleeps	shroom	PIZZA RECIPES FOR YOU! and a big Thank You! to sprileet	Last week I won a contest and sprileet ordered a copy of "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pizza & Panini" for me.  I received the book yesterday, and today I cooked my first "official" homemade pizza!  Sprileet requested photos, so [here](http://imgur.com/a/PuGhy#3tf6L) is an album depicting the delicious effort from start to finish.  I purchased all the supplies for these pizzas for about $15 at my local Kroger's. I didn't follow the recipes to the letter - either out of stupidity (like the fact that I bought red wine *vinegar* instead of red wine) or necessity (my local store didn't have cake flour, so I substituted all-purpose flour instead) - but it came out great. I give all credit to the recipes - these pizzas tasted better than delivery and were so satisfying to make!  **Think it looks good? Why not make it yourself?!**  The author has kindly agreed to let me share his recipes for [Pizza Dough](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u_7N_7__9TO7gx_bN014GzyB0Lo9L-lBychBc5BxdG8/edit?hl=en_US), [Pomodoro Fresca Sauce](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n-LnELOdCqEcnjqQFWBdj1BzEFa9gMt13iMSSjIZc98/edit?hl=en_US), and [Deep-Dish Pizza](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVT_gt1NMnt-3nTTX8dA9bcmgifTVP0F9rnRVlWhtAE/edit?hl=en_US). Hooray!  Now you can make delicious homemade pizza too, at about half the cost of delivery and bucketloads more satisfaction.  [The book](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Pizza-Panini/dp/1592576583/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318009156&sr=8-1) is excellent. There's a broad range of tastes and flavors represented, ranging from the fancy-schmancy (Salmon and Dill Cream Sauce Pizza) to new spins on the mundane (Cheese Pizza). Instructions are clear and easy to follow, and [the author](http://eriksherman.com/) teaches tips, tricks, and variations along the way. For example, this recipe for Pizza Dough is one of three, and the book includes recipes for naan, ciabatta, white sauce, salsa, international varieties of pizza.. even breakfast and dessert pizzas, and one I can't pronounce at all (flaeskeaeggekage)! If you can get yourself a copy, I'd highly recommend it.   Sprileet, thank you for the book. It made my day when I received it yesterday, and it's made my day today with this delicious, cheap meal - and it will continue to bring tummies full of joy to my family.  Mr Erik Sherman, thank you for sharing with the Reddit community. Your book is fantastic and I appreciate your kindness.  RAoP, keep being awesome!

We've redone the website [www.randomactsofpizza.com](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com).    Lots of new people were having trouble learning the Reddit site, so now [www.randomactsofpizza.com](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com) is geared as an entry point into Reddit.  It has links to all the important stuff for all of us old hands (like verification) and instructions for all the newbs.  The site is still beta and we'd appreciate it if people would look it over and suggest any wording changes or point out grammar and spelling errors.  All of the mods have gone over it and we will be tweaking it some more over the next couple of days.  We'd also like some community suggestions.    We will be getting some more media attention soon and we'd like to emphasize the community nature of RAOP and the ethos of giving and "Pizza It Forward" that we've all developed.  Any ideas on how to best educate new members is especially appreciated.  Please feel free to include text suggestions that we can add to the site.  As part of the new web design we have a [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/random_pizza) account and a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/randomactsofpizza) page.  New Reddit threads are auto-posted to both.   Thanks to [Craig Morrison](http://www.craigmorrison.ca/) aka [seamore555](http://www.reddit.com/user/seamore555) for the webpage design and twitter and Facebook integration.  Thanks to Andrew (whose Reddit name I don't have) who created the Facebook page and graciously turned it over to the moderators when asked.  And finally, thanks to everyone here.  It is pretty easy to find my real life name when searching for Random Acts of Pizza.  I'm proud and humbled that my real life identity is tied to such a great group of people!	True
t3_l466e	1317999526.0	BOTW	pizza-gold	FFFFFFFFFFFF (not what you think!) FFFFFRIDAY! - My weekly random college student pizza offer.	OK, it's Friday again. Here's my eighth weekly offer (and after 8 weeks, it STILL feels cool).   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have heard the name Abraham Lincoln and be able to distinguish a photo of him from, say, Queen Elizabeth.   4) You must either reply or PM me that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 5pm Pacific time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ----------------------------------  [And the winner is](http://i.imgur.com/7VBru.jpg):  DorothyMantooth - I'll be PM'ing her a $20 eCard for Domino's which was her choice.

t3_l1lcz	1317812496.0	DEStudent	PIF	OFFER! Pizza from a Muslim	**HELLO ALL** Well the time has come that I can finally begin helping rather than requesting. So I'm thinking of how I want to do this. I'm going to make this post a contest. Some of you may know that I am a Muslim woman. Rather than a number generator, **I want someone to guess my favorite surah of Quraan. You don't need to be Muslim to enter.** **It's that simple. One entry per person. The first one that guesses correctly will win a gift card to one of the top 3.**  Also, because I know we have trolls, anyone making sarcastic or rude comments, will not only be disqualified, they will also be reported. It's my offering, my money and I can decide who is gifted. Thank you.  Keep guessing all! I will announce the winner later this evening. There are 114 Surahs  **EDIT**: Contest is officially closed all. My favorite Surah is Surah Yaseen 36. For those curious to hear it or what it means, here is a link to a Youtube recitation. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrD8gO43F0c with English Subtitles.   I have many favorite, but that one just touches my heart. I know some of you may be wondering- So what? Why did I post that I am Muslim? Well honestly, I wanted people to know that despite a lot of media coverage, not all Muslims are terrorist. There's no need to fear us or hate us. Those that are so extreme make up less than 1% of my way of life...  It's my sincere intention that I helped some people, maybe got them to thinking and at least fed some people today. I also sent pizza to others that may not have guessed correctly, but just genuinely seemed to wanted/needed one. I hope that if anyone has any **questions about Islaam or about what we believe they will ask me or another Muslim**.  Lastly, I plan to give another day and time and I look forward to hopefully helping others and making people **smile!** Please don't be discouraged if you didn't win. **THANK YOU ALL FOR PLAYING AND TAKING TIME TO READ**	True

I want to send a true heartfelt thank you to all of you who have helped someone, currently I'm not in a situation where I can help, for that matter I'm in some bad shape and have been helped twice here, but that's not what I'm thanking you for today.   I often read the posts of those who have requested and I read how quickly people respond and tonight I read the story of nathanbutcher....and it touched my heart how quickly 2 people came to his need going above and beyond a pizza, I actually ended in tears because as bad as I want to help others I can't right now. But all of you are truly amazing, and I will repay my pizza debt, and when things turn around for me I aspire to treat others as you have and go above and beyond.

EDIT: I'm asking because i genuinely need it, not because its my reddit b-day, I have been working day labor because I cant get an actual job where I live, but part of the problem with day labor is if you dont get sent out for whatever reason, you dont eat that day.

t3_kyfsr	1317573509.0	Psychosanity		I new to RAOP, Can someone describe a step by step process on how to send a pizza? It's mostly the verification and scammer part that confuses me. How do I use the verification system, and how does one get scammed? I don't see how to scam someone giving away free giftcards or anything.	Please let me know, i would like to start sending you guys pizzas =)	
t3_kyfcg	1317572507.0	Becco		Wife is at home with two kids under 5, and my mother!	My wonderful stay at home wife is stuck at home with 2 kids (5 year old boy, 2 year old girl) and my mother while I am at work.  no one has the gas money to go anywhere, or money to do anything if they could get there.  Meanwhile I am stuck working a 12 1/2 hour long day eating canned soup.  My wife stays home to take care of the kids to ensure they get the proper attention great kids deserve, and I think a RAOP would be a great way to show her that she's appreciated, and there are people out there that care!  I won't get into the sob story of it all (unless there is real interest), but my wife has alot of stress and burdens to carry.  I think the world could use more wonderful people like her!

I plan to pay it forward soon as my FAFSA money comes in.  They installed new toilets in my building on Tuesday but they are still working on this even though it's Thursday.

I thought it was rain only to discover the apartment above me has a leaky air conditioner that leaked down on my clothes and my laptop. I didn't panic, I called my insurance company this morning. Since my laptop is older and I have a $500 deductible, it's really not worth it.

t3_kvbt2	1317308443.0	menmybabies	menmy	TO SARTIM, We ALL Thank YOU!!!	SarTim, your post allowing us to honor an unsung hero in our everyday lives allowed me the chance to share an amazing woman with RAoP.  I've since spoken to you in private and also updated that the grandma was not well.  The inevitable has occured, she peacefully passed away.  She lived a long, wise, prosperous love filled life.  These past months have been full of pain and heartache for them.  I am thankful the suffering is over for her.  She is in a place with no more pain and suffering.  She will truly be missed on Earth.  I felt compelled to post this today and once again thank you.  They live a stressful life as a family and struggle as much or more than the next person.  Yet each day is full of smiles and love for them.  The night you held your contest and they were "chosen" it was sheer excitement.     A surprise from start to delivery, one they never expected.  As I left them at the table with their meal in from of them, you could feel the smiles beaming off the walls.  A night with no worry, no stress and a truly good and filling meal they shared.    As I mentioned to you, my friends mom *mine too* told everyone about what you bestowed on them.  More than pizza, it was knowing someone cared enough to give them a treat.  This was huge for "mom" who I'd written in about and was especially hard for her grandma.  They come from times where neighbors helped neighbors but, these days it doesn't happen like that.  For them to experience this together, in such bitter times meant a lot to them all, grandkids included.    I want to thank you for giving them a recent night full of good times along with memories to hold onto.  That night will not soon be forgotten and with great grandmas passing, will mean so much more.  Bottom line, thank you for allowing me to share them with you.  Thank you for gifting them such a wonderful time together and most of all, thank you for being you.  You guys might think *a pizza is nothing*  I assure you this is not so.  It goes deeper than a meal, it is comfort knowing someone is there who is able to lend a hand to lift someone else up, regardless of their finacial position in life.  Sometimes, it truly is the little things that matter and mean the most.  In no way am I saying what you've done is little, I am just saying maybe not everyone realizes how much these random acts mean to other people.  Thank you SarTim and RAoP for being the greatest!	
t3_kvbfi	1317307784.0	menmybabies	menmy	Thank You AND Apology to in2itiveact	This comes late and for that, I apologize.  You were drunk and ordered pizza for my family.  Went through hell placing an order not for only my family, but for two people on that thread.  Took a lot of time and patience on your part to pizza us, thank you for that.  I popped on to let you know it had arrived and I planned to be back on soon after.  I don't have a camera but, made arrangements to borrow the neighbors when she returned from errands.  I got a phone call that haulted my plans.  I am pictureless and I owe you.  Please let me know if we can draw you up something or send you a hand written thank you.  I don't want you to think we aren't appreciative.  A really good friend of mine's great grandmother passed away.  This family while not blood related, *is* my family.  I got the call, we left shortly after and I have not been back online since.  I was given a chance to share my "loved one" through a contest our wonderful SarTim held.  I am back home with the grandkids to give the family time to handle the obvious.    Please excuse my ill manners for my late thank you and lack of pictures.  My intentions were not for this to happen, I hope you understand and can be forgiving of me.

Details inside, winner decided at 7:30PM EST, gift card to be sent immediately after.	It's my reddit cake day and I feel kind of dirty after submitting a blatant karma whoring post to r/pics, so I decided to balance my IRL karma by giving someone the best gift of all, pizza! As I said in the title, the redditor who lives closest to my hometown of Winchester, VA will receive a $15 Domino's gift card. If multiple Winchester redditors show up (which would be impressive since I've only met 3...) I'll base the winner on who lives the closest to my actual address. Addresses will be exchanged through PM. And if this results in acquiring a personal stalker, hey, at least I started the relationship off right with a gift. Don't be discouraged if you live in Idaho or someplace super far away, maybe no one will see this thread and you'll win be default. Also, I may throw in a smaller prize for the person who lives the furthest from me (continental US only, sorry overseas redditors :( ). Winner decided at 7:30PM EST, so act quickly!  UPDATE: Bdiehr emerged as the winner and received the $15 gift card. I also threw in $5 cards for taris300 (who was the only other person to send photo proof) and DorthyMantooth (who was the furthest from me in the continental US). I hope you guys enjoy, I had a blast doing this and I'll probably be back soon :)	True

I copied this from the Dominos Face Book page, I guess some folkes tried ( & suceeded) scamming more than1 pizza yesterday. They are working on it. Can't people just be greatful for such a cool offer, and not try to scam more???  Domino's Pizza Fans, we apologize again for the issues with the Domino's Artisan Pizza tab on Tuesday. We’ve been working all night to fix things, and we’ve determined that there were a few people who were so excited to get a free Domino's Artisan Pizza that they turned to unfair means to get one. This, in turn, led to a poor experience for the vast majority of you who simply wanted to try our new pizza.   Before we re-activate the tab, we’re taking some time to ensure those few bad apples don’t ruin the fun in the future. We know Domino’s fans are the best out there and we are so excited to learn of your interest in our new Domino's Artisan Pizzas. Thank you for your patience as we get things back up and running!   Thank you Doninos!

t3_ksrg9	1317112071.0	spartican		 free artisans tip	It's is not random and just because you got page overload with love does not mean they ran out. Your best chances to get a Free artisans pizza, is at 3:05pm -3:30pm.  When it's is 3:00pm est,west coast domino's shops open. They take 5-7 minutes to load the link on the page. When the time hit's 3:05 everyone will automatically rush in causing the page to overload.  Give it time, evidently people will give up thinking they have ran out and give you a opening.   I got mine at 3:17-3:20pm  Sadly due a sudden change of plans, I give mine to a friend. If I get another one and do not use it, I shall offer it here.

They also have a bunch of other codes for discounts too.  Some stores don't accept some of these codes, so try another location if you have more than one local to you. The one by my house doesn't whereas all the others in my area do...I'm guessing they just have a really stingy owner/manager or something.  I was able to get an artisan pizza along with 2 orders of Cinnastix for free today. You might want to be careful if you're just getting free items (aside from the artisan pizzas which are one-time use codes). They might be suspicious if you're going in and only getting free cinnastix.  Sorry if this is inappropriate here, just wanted to help anyone who might be ordering from Dominos anyway whether it be for themselves or someone else!

My fiance and I have been living scarcely ever since we moved into Sioux Falls, SD in April since we bought a house.  He's currently unemployed (but giving plasma for money) and I'm not actually making enough with my job, which is commission based and last month was awful for sales.

t3_kptim	1316842070.0	Ambie79109	shroom	{Request} An awesome 8 year old deserves a pizza. (Tx)	Howdy RAOP! I've been in a giant funk lately that I've been unable to pull myself out of, then then tonight my son surprised me. He wrote me a little note saying that I should play Xbox with him and take my "mind off of things," along with other sweet things.   We played for about 2 hours while he asked me questions about when I was in 3rd grade and joked around about Space Chimps. It was the funnest time I've had in a long time and really reminded me about what's important.   I don't have access to my account until Monday night since the fiance has my card on a trip for a class for work. I have stuff for the weekend but it's all meals that my son doesn't really enjoy that much. Since neither of us will go hungry this weekend I will completely understand if you would rather give to someone who needs it more than myself, but I would love to treat my "punkin" for everything he did for me tomorrow sometime. Taking a pizza to the park is one of his favorite things.  I will be making offers next week, whether or not I get a pizza so even if you're just reading this and you're hungry be sure to check back with me then. :)   I think it's time for a great nights sleep now but I will check back tomorrow!	
t3_kps71	1316838427.0	jeremyosborne81	shroom	Sadly, I'm moving out of my apartment Sunday.  I would appreciate some pizza while finishing my packing Saturday night.	I'm moving back in with my parents. Why? Last year I moved into a nice little two bedroom place with a roommate. After six months my roommate left because he lost his job. I could barely afford the place and started looking for replacement roommates.  Had one stay for one month then abandon me (That's Craigslist quality there). A third roommate moved in, but only for the summer because he was doing an internship here in Dallas. While he was there I was laid off from my packing/shipping clerk position and spent two months unemployed.  Third roommate's internship ends and he has to go back to school in August. Fourth roommate moves in for the final two months of my lease.  I have a new job now but it pays less and has less hours than my previous job. Three weeks after starting this job, my car caught fire. The power steering pump overheated and ignited. In the time it took the fire department to arrive all plastic components and aluminum pieces under the hood melted and the hood itself was scorched. I only had liability on the car, so no insurance payment.  Sunday I move back to my parent's apartment. A)To help them save money to buy a new car (my mother's was repossessed a couple months ago.) B)So I can save money and buy a car.  Also, I will be 30 on the 25th of October.	True

Now, here is the pizza.   http://i.imgur.com/VrilS.jpg  ninja edit; Reddit should give you 5-10 min of time to edit the title post. Also, I can't stress enough how hard it is to send a pizza across the border. No e-cards, and everywhere wants to have the credit card available when you answer the door.

t3_ko41e	1316713264.0	hawkeyepeers	shroom	Handmade RAOP Reddit Alien Sculpture - YOURS For Pizza + Shipping!	I made a [RAOP Reddit Alien](http://imgur.com/QjLX5)! Isn't it cute?  It's made of Super Sculpey on a wire frame, with acrylic paints. It measures about three inches high - just right for sitting next to your monitor or on a bookshelf, where you can show off your Reddit pride and your generosity.  I have a family of five and no income. A good dinner for everyone ($25-$30) plus a little money to cover shipping for your Alien ($5-$10) would make all of us very happy.  So leave a comment or send a PM, and let's get this little guy en route to you.. and some food en route to my family's bellies!  I'm in Ferndale Mi (just outside of Detroit)	True

Luckily, my roommate is letting  me slide on rent until I get a new job, and my GF just got a TB shot and took a CPR class so she can do her new job (helping disabled people). Right now we are in a bind, funds have run out, but it won't be much longer before we are okay again. We're hungry today though.

You have to a) provide proof of non scamming (verification and a pic with your user name, b) have been a redditor for a little bit (my discretion on what is a "little bit" sorry newbies, I really don't wanna get scammed) and c) (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE) If you get one pie from me you now owe reddit 2 when you have the money/time. Don't PM me, post your proof pic in the comments, and I'll grab someone completely random that meets my qualifications in an hour and a half (thats 1pm EST kiddies)  EDIT: 15 minutes!  2nd edit: Contest closed.

However, he (the boy) has been working overtime like crazy and yesterday he had a blowout of his back tire and we had to get all four of his tires replaced.   If someone is feeling generous, I would love to feel the love.   Thanks guys and even if no one answers my call, I've noticed how many pizzas have been gifted to people who really need it and you guys are awesome! Keep being amazing and thanks! Oh!

He was shocked when I gave him the whole box. in2itiveact does not know how much he/she helped out tonight. We probably fed about 5-6 random homeless people in Vegas, and definately made their day.

t3_kn9w7	1316646715.0	hippiekidonelove		Metropolis Illinois 	Hi, I'm not sure how this works, I mean I grasp the general concept. My name is Jessycah, I'm not starving but I do need meal to feed myself and the people I live with. Last year we decided to move into a shack down a long dirt road in the middle of the woods, because we wanted to become one with nature. We don't have internet, cell phones, or television(I am currently at a public library and we have one landline phone). We are a group of 5 including myself. We are out of food and none of us have jobs. (I'm currently seeking employment) we are vegetarians and we would really love a meal. I know that there are probably more needy out there but we would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading.	
t3_kn93k	1316645242.0	bunsofcheese	pizza	[Offer, but not pizza] A Keg gift card - Toronto	This is my first time and i'm not quite sure what to do.  I have a $50 Keg gift card and it looks like I'm never going to use it, so I'd like to give it to someone who fancies a night out.  It's the Keg, so $50 might not buy everything on the menu, but it'll feed one person nicely or put a dent in the bill for two.  I don't want anyone jumping through hoops, but I will pick the person with the nicest reason. (edit - and some form of verification would be nice)  Since it's an actual physical card, we will likely have to meet and i can hand it over - or if you're verified, I can mail it...  anyone interested?	
t3_kn8dt	1316644018.0	in2itiveact	pizza-gold	YSK That it's not only possible but it's easy to order pizza for USA delivery from Australia with an Australian credit card	I have successfully ordered from Australia for USA delivery to multiple US addresses from Dominos, Pizza Hut and Papa Johns.  Unfortunately you can't order gift cards, so you need a physical address for delivery. In most cases I got away with listing my name and my Australian mobile (cell) number. When it came time to provide credit card details the only information they required for verification was a zip code. I simply put a zero in front of my four digit Australian post code and voila, pizza on its way.  Policy for all three of those pizza chains is to collect a signature and view the card on delivery, but that was no obstacle for any of my recipients. Where necessary they could simply flash any old card and scrawl any old signature.  So Aussie redditors, get on board and get some pizzas out there to our American friends. I will soon attempt to see if we can also help out other countries as well.  And YSalsoK that this likely works in reverse as well. Dominos Australia (dominos.com.au) only requires a credit card with no verification address, so our American and other international redditors can also send pizza to us over here in Australia! Don't be shy guys, share the pizza goodness!  :)

Everything was all well and good until someone stole our debit card number. They got away with cash, gas, and a bunch of other crap from our local convenience store. (I think they used a key stroke logger from when we got gas earlier this week). Our account is on lock-down and the bank isn't open, so we have no way of getting money. We gave earlier this week (We responded privately to a post on someone else's offer. We can give you their name via PM to verify.) and intend to do so again.   We hope someone can help.

t3_kj2tj	1316303477.0	t__mhjr	shroom	REQUEST: Los Angeles! Starting my business, would love a pizza. Let's make a deal.	Starting a personalized songwriting business. It's going to turn into a community for songwriters and listeners to interact and coordinate the creation of a personalized song. Ideally, it's going to forever close the gap between the songwriter and listener, and give struggling, talented songwriters an opportunity to bring happiness to anyone in need of a song, for anything; but I've got a lot of work to do before then.  I probably won't have enough for rent this month, but my landlord's anniversary is coming up and I'm writing a song for his wife, in exchange for letting me be a week late. This leaves the unfortunate angle of food. I'm all out of bread.  Instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. I will write a song about whatever you want. (Literally.) It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. I'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.  If you're interested in hearing about my business, I'm funding Step 1 through kickstarter.com. [Here's the link to that](http://kck.st/pgKaih) Back me, or send it to a friend you think might be interested in a personalized song.   Otherwise, pizza for a song. Savvy?  If you want to hear some samples of what I do, check www.soundcloud.com/thallett (not sure why it's not linking...) out.  Thanks!  EDIT: **Thank you Czhunc for the pizza! It was fantastic. The offer is still open to anyone that wants it. I can always use a pizza. ** 	True

My name is Jessycah, I'm not starving but I do need meal to feed myself and the people I live with. Last year we decided to move into a shack down a long dirt road in the middle of the woods, because we wanted to become one with nature. We don't have internet, cell phones, or television(I am currently at a public library and we have one landline phone). We are a group of 5 including myself. We are out of food and none of us have jobs. (I'm currently seeking employment) we are vegetarians and we would really love a meal. I know that there are probably more needy out there but we would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading.

But my stupid stomach is like "rofl, pizza now!"  You want my sob story of I can't pay rent or anything? I don't have one. The bills are all payed, I'm just hungry. I'm being lazy really..

t3_kigas	1316238389.0	TheGreatGildersleeve	shroom	Big thanks to SarTim for making our move much better with pizza!	SarTim is an amazingly generous member who saw my thank you thread to another RAOPer (RAOPist???) Sierachowwhiskey and offered to help keep the help coming in rough time for my little family this week.   For those following my story I'm a now single Dad of three great kids trying to rebuild while Mom has gone off to chase her addiction and I'm in a wheelchair due to a painful autoimmune disorder.   I first posted two weeks ago after a particularly bad week and I wanted to have a special movie night before I told the kids we had to move. The community response was just above and beyond and I was so grateful to give the kids a respite. This week we have moved in with family qnd living out of boxes at the moment and SarTim came to my rescue and I was able to have an easy dinner and reward the kids for working their tails this week moving. It was a nice way to make a fresh start.   While it can be humbling to reach out in times of need, I was honest with my kids about where this pizza came from and the support of people like SarTim has inspired us to try to pay it forward in the ways we can so tomorrow we are going to an open house at the Lion's Club here to sign up to volunteer in our community with things like cleaning up gutters and yards of the elderly and packing food packages to donate to local families.  So thank you again SarTim for filling our bellies and ROAP for being such great community of caring people willing to lend a hand when we're down.   And SarTim sorry I couldn't dig the camera out of the boxes tonight. I'll be lucky if I can find anything in this cardboard jungle for a few days!

I'm in school right now and have a part-time job, but most if not all of my paychecks each month usually go to housing and bills, and food usually finds itself at the end of that list. I've been doing fine lately with the Food Bank and living off stamps, but earlier this week I was told my stamp application lapsed and I won't have a reload for another 2 weeks at least.

t3_khwp6	1316198107.0	Cat_Shampoo	shroom	Request: Mother and son without food for the weekend, could use a hand	Hey, folks. I'd really hate to ask for any assistance from anyone, especially since there are more needy people out there, but we've kind of hit a snag and could really use the help.  Here's the deal: I'm 22, and I live with my mom. We've been going through some pretty rough times as of late -- we're knee deep in debt, going through a foreclosure on our home, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for months on end. Mom works part-time at a hospital, and I've been looking for work for quite awhile, but as of yet nothing's come up. We've been living on what food my mom can get from her work (employees can get food in exchange for 'payroll reduction', where they take the charges right out of their paycheck), but this week's pay cycle just ran out, meaning we can't get any more food there until this coming week. Groceries haven't been a realistic possibility with our income lately, so until then, we're out of luck (and food) this weekend. We've got twenty dollars in the bank to cover gas, but that's about it.  In addition to all of this, my mom suffers from a myriad of health issues, so between that and all of the stress from our financial situation, she feels absolutely miserable. I'm hoping that maybe some delicious pizza would at least take her mind off things and brighten up her day a bit.  Again, I feel awful asking for help,  but any at all would be greatly appreciated, and when we can afford it, we will definitely be able donate a pizza or two here.

Normally I'm requesting pizza for myself, but since I can't treat him to pizza, I'd like it if someone could do so in my stead, I'm sure it'd make him feel alot better.  Unfortunately I live in Bristol, VA and he lives in Arlington so I can't go over to help cheer him up.  Much love in advance to whoever can help my best bud out.

My wife and son are out of state on a unexpected family emergency. I had to sell my Macbook to help finance the trip. I'm working 2 jobs right now to pay the mortgage and try to keep our bills paid. Living paycheck to paycheck and getting nowhere. We are lucky to have a roof over our heads and food on the table but eating out is a luxury we can not often afford. I only have a few bucks on me for gas until Friday when I get paid and my family comes home. A pizza would be amazing right now and I would be happy to pay it forward in the near future.

FL	My girlfriend and I live together, we were doing ok until yesterday when I was laid off from my job, it was unexpected and now we can't afford dinner until she gets paid Friday. The money we have left, is going towards gas for me to try to find a job, and to buy our dog and 2 cats food. We have a pizza would be amazing, and pizza hut has the 10 dollar any deal. I beg that someone please help us out, I want us to be able to have a dinner. Once she gets paid friday, we will pay it forward, she donates her time to charity and helping our local shelter. Thank you for your time.

t3_ke2wp	1315908349.0	nfatogdtrfb		RAoP Statistics??? (Curiosity is another hunger)	I was wondering a few things about RAoP. Since I've been watching the American economy tank for a few years I've read several articles about economic indicators like Big Mac prices, generic brand buying, and other little quirks of spending that reflect the economy at large.   So what about a subreddit where the down and out are sent pizza? There has to be some data reflecting our predicament at large somewhere.   Can any moderators vouch for some things like when the requests spike, spiked, or started to rise; are requests being filled more or less often?   I'm not familiar with RAoP beyond the comments I run into on other threads every once in a while (which has to be an indicator of something in our online society when someone mentions a charitable pizza subreddit in the comments to a gif or something).  Any ideas?	
t3_kdtif	1315883557.0	playsinpaint	PIF	to those who misunderstood me when I asked for a pizza due to being broke.	apparently when I requested a pizza earlier today I offended someone, I have since pulled down my post. I had put a comment that spoons of peanut butter did not sound good for dinner and they said this seemed like a red flag, and that if I were really that in need to go to the salvation army or a church. Now here's the deal, yes I literally am broke right now, and if I can stretch 2 boxes of pasta, a can of tomato paste, and a jar of PB then good for me! I was asking for a pizza because it would be nice to have something good tonight instead of 'dinner al a ghetto' now I usually don't get offended by people but they told me to utilize these free food closets if we are that hungry. For the record I have a job, I get paid on friday all of this had been previously stated in my post, after my bills I will have about a $100 left for groceries and I was going to give a pizza to pay it forward. Why should I take food from these charities when I know for a fact that there are hungry children in this area who's family use the same thing! I can't take food away from those needy families just because I'm hungry, I'm an adult I'll deal if I go hungry, I'll take my last $2 and go buy enough ramen for a week, I just thought a pizza would be really great tonight and I thought I could join this site and be a member on both the giving (when possible) and the receiving (when needed) sides, I didn't realize that people who be quite so opinionated even though it says on the right hand side of the page that you can ask for whatever reasons. I'm sorry if any of you thought I was trying to take advantage of the page to get a free pizza, I'll just stick to ramen. goodnight. 	
t3_kds2x	1315880999.0	Kileah		Idea for RAoP Papa John's community account, free pizza!	So they give a free large pizza away for every $125 spent on a single papa john's account. If there is a community pool account maybe for something like this, or if thats too insecure, when you order pizza, and you're using a cash option, just order it from the community account, and I'm sure in no time we'll be cranking out dozens of free pizzas for the needy a week!

t3_kdqot	1315878572.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	Thoughts for requesters	I'd like to state first up that these are just some thoughts. Not even solid hypotheses, or firm opinions, or unbreakable laws. Further, they're just MY thoughts and shouldn't be taken to represent anyone else here, although I'd appreciate other people's thoughts too.  RAoP is awesome. I'm sure you knew that already. Requesters have the chance to be gifted with tasty pizza, and givers get the chance to help someone out and feel warm and fuzzy about it.  Sometimes I see a lot of unanswered requests and it makes me wonder why some requests get offers but not others.   Here are my thoughts:   * The people who give pizza, on the most part, aren’t spectacularly rich or anything. They’re people who are doing ok, or who have an extra bit of money this week, or have a bit of discretionary income. They’re people who are not buying that new pair of shoes/new game/cup of coffee/magazine/expensive food because it’s more fun and rewarding to give pizza. Givers can’t afford to give to everyone, so every giver has their own criteria (and WHATEVER that criteria is, it’s a perfectly fine criteria).  * Posts with only one line requesting a pizza may be more likely to be overlooked because perhaps it’s easy to draw a line between how much effort someone puts into requesting a pizza to how much they want it.  * Similarly, people with accounts which are hours or days old, or only post on RAoP may be overlooked because they may be creating the impression that all the requester is interested in is pizza.  * People are empathetic – they like to hear stories and feel connected and involved. Perhaps telling a bit about yourself and your situation may help people connect with you. If your account is a new account, this may be particularly important, as there’s not even a reddit history to look at. Let people know what a pizza would mean to you. Perhaps you could describe your job, or your family, or the things that you like to do/watch/play. Maybe your burning passion for alpacas is shared by another alpaca enthusiast who happens to have some extra money from an alpaca sale. Make the reader feel as though you’re not just a screen-name looking for a quick feed, but a real, live, feeling person whose day would be brightened by a pizza or two.  * Speaking as someone who’s given a couple of pizzas away, there’s nothing more I like than seeing a photo afterwards! (It can be via PM, and it doesn’t even need to show you in it.) I like to know that the pizza got there safely and that you’re enjoying it. Your joy is my reward. Also, *please* and *thank you* are wonderful words – free to use and they make the world a nicer place. Please, use them liberally.  **TL;DR** – nothing, these are just some idle thoughts. DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT take them as RAoP gospel or apply them as though they were! Oh, and don’t be mean to each other. That’s not nice. :P 	True

Candis2k6 Very Sweetly decided to withdraw from the contest because she saw others more in need (though she quoted the pawnedTV story as her example reason for withdrawing and that's the item that went unverified).  So - we try again.  And I'm by my computer now so I'll be able to be more attentive!  I've awarded 3 potentially, but the chances that all 3 will be able to provide proof of their stories is, historically speaking, highly unlikely.  If they can, I'll be buying 3 pizzas, but I'm gonna continue to be a stickler for the requested evidence.  I trust my reasons for that are easily understood. **[/EDIT2]**   **[EDIT**: we have 2 winners.    * candis2k6 just PM'd me (but will have to post on the thread to win the pizza.  Wins, because she actually sent in convincing evidence without me having to propose what I defined as 'proof'.  And she has 1622 comment karma.  A new record in my pizza recipients so I find it easy to trust her. * Putamoonrockonit.  You're a provisional winner.  Validate your story - The Way I Have Requested - and your whole family can dip into pizza tonight.  Without wishing to sound like a dick, if you half-validate or explain why my validation can't be met then I'll move on to a new winner.  I got scammed once and I'm getting comfortable being efficient in this process.  Summary: You deserve it.  So does the next person.   You get first crack!  :)  Both of you, please let me know what kind of gift card you want (PapaJohns/Dominos/Pizzahut) and send me a verification code from [here](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/).**[/EDIT]**  If you're having tough times then prove it and I'll buy 2 of you a pizza (actually, I'll give you a $25 pizza gift card, so with the help of the right coupon it's possible that I'm buying you 3 or 4 pizzas).  However, I'm a suspicious sumbitch so you may find it's a high bar to make me think "Yup, that's Definitely not a clever scammer".  If you think you can get over the bar, then Come On Down!  BTW - I'll be out for a while today so may not be monitoring this thread constantly.  So it's possible that the pizza you win will be feeding you tomorrow night.	True

t3_kc0pp	1315746672.0	Zeinheiger	shroom	Thankyou SVENJJ in more ways than one	Thankyou to Svenjj, who bought me and my housemate pizza... But I also have a story, I lost my job 2 weeks ago, so my housemate has been paying the bills/rent by herself, I've been applying for jobs everywhere I can, but to no avail so far and have remained unemployed, which makes paying off our bills/rent fairly hard for us, as I no longer have any funds left... When We got into the pizza place to buy said pizza, as we were there, I decided to enquire whether they needed any workers... Turns out they needed a delivery driver, got the job no problem, so now until I get myself back on my feet, I have at least some type of income, in saying that, if it wasn't for Sven, I'd still be stuck in a rut... So I have that to thank him for as well... We did promise to show my housemate wearing her new latex dress holding a love note...

t3_kbo6n	1315706444.0	llamas1355		I get it now.	I never really understood random acts of pizza, not that I'm a cold hearted person, I guess I just never saw how pizza fixed anything. Until today. I live in an area of Pennsylvania that was just hammered by record floods. My grandparents and aunt live in an area that was among the most devastated. Today was the first day we were able to get into that area and we picked up 10 pizza's on the way for people that had taken shelter at my aunt's house. The red cross isn't set up yet so these people have no water, no electricity, and no food. We gave a few boxes away to people who were emptying their entire houses and one lady was so grateful I though she was going to cry. Over a box of pizza! I almost cried at her reaction myself. I figured out it's not really about the pizza, it's more about the fact that some one wants to help you, some one out there cares enough about you and your situation to go out of their way to give you something and expect nothing in return. I commend you random acts of pizza. Thank you for making people smile. You guys are great.

Hello, I am an adult student (32) with two young children (6 and 8) and a disabled husband, on a fixed income and we have been struggling to feed our family lately.  It has eased up a little bit since school started and they are able to eat breakfast, lunch and a snack there. We have applied for food stamps and it has been over a month and we still have not received them yet do to administrative miscommunication on the part of our local office.  We even filed for a fair hearing and won, and the office is still dragging their feet. There are a few food banks here in Tucson that we have utilized, but beans, rice and canned vegi's can only be prepared so many ways.  Any help that anyone can give would be greatly appreciated.  May God bless anyone and everyone who is kind enough to help those of us in need and struggling day to day.  Thank you so much in advance.    Sincerely, Janis L. Atwater Tucson, Arizona

Way to wear the mods nerves folks....   #1   If you do not want to offer a pizza do not #@$#@!$ comment in the post. The only exception to this rule is encouragement, we have some that do this regularly, it is good.....  #2  If you suspect a scam pm us!!!! Do not call them out publicly. This does more harm than good. We have watched this from the start, and know that this will give a rise to the scammers, but drive away those in need.  #3  If all you do here is request, and call out people you think are scamming, go away..... please....  #4  If you request make sure you let everyone know you have gotten before.  If any of these rules are broken your post/comment will be removed(lots of them in the past 24hrs). If repeated attempts are made you will be not welcome here.   It is clearly stated in the rules and guidelines that people with new accounts are far less likely to be helped. It is also stated, and well known that givers can ask for whatever proof they need to make them feel comfortable.  Overall please remember why we are here.

t3_k5u3c	1315266246.0	badbrownie	brownie	Pizza For The Cutest Smile	<Drama>  Well, I'm not sure how to say this.  Disappointment, thy name is RAOP Pizza Giving.  So - here's the story: yesterday the lovely Brandi's mom earned a hardship pizza.  And inspired by the cute smile Brandi made in the pic I decided to have this contest and let Brandi judge it.  I thought to myself "Wouldn't it be a shame if they fixed it so they snagged another pizza by awarding it to themselves" but I figured that that kind of level of suspicion is where madness lies so I ignored it (just like we all correctly ignore a million little suspicions like that every day).  Then, this morning Nathanbucher posted "Can we email our pic?" and shortly thereafter NathanBucher responded "Well brandi would like to see it so u can email it to us I PMd our email address...".  Hmmmmm.  Not being an utter moron, my first thought was "Shit.  Nathanbucher is a sockpuppet and my honorable judge didn't logout before responding."  But I didn't want to start accusing.  This is RAOP and We Believe In People so I figured I'd just seem confused and hope that the problem would go away.  It was easy for the problem to go away.  All that had to happen was for our judge's mom to realize she was somewhat busted and NOT award the pizza to Nathanbucher.  Then I could have pretended to myself that I saw nothing and not go re-assessing my faith in Reddit strangers.    but Lo, 5pm rolls around and the results are emailed to me and who should have won the pizza in the adult category?  Yup.  :(  I could waffle on about how disappointed I am but, to be honest, life is good to me (as I am to it) so all this is about to be put behind me.  But I'll be more stringent in the evidence I require of hardship in the future and less embarrassed about asking for it.  </Drama>  There.  It's behind me.  So obviously Nathanbucher and the other "Brandi" nominated winner are not getting pizzas so I pulled my wife into the judging.  There were a couple of super strong contenders.  The late entry from imawsomeyay was, as promised, awesome, but the mrs and I were in agreement that Mom is going to have to learn that you can indeed get things with nothing but your good looks when those looks are fronted by sandpipers smile.  PM me and send me a verification code and your email addy and your preference of pizza coupon (papajohns/pizzahut/dominos) cos you're a winner.  In the under 13 category there was, in the end fewer contestants.  After Cassiewilber's nomination was DQ'd (no blame, you may be totally innocent but I trust you'll understand my reasoning), the award goes to cuttyflam, who - hilariously - may be the mom for all I could tell but if you are then you've aged well 'cos you just took the under 13 category!  :)  Sorry for the drama.  I'm not interested in appeals of innocence though and will try to avoid getting pulled into anything to do with such appeals.  **[EDIT: This contest may end up getting lopsided if there are lots of kid entries.  I love the "Know Thy Judge" strategy of entering kid pics but to give the grown ups a chance we're going to award 2 winners.  One in the Over 13 category and one in the Under 13 category (if you're 13 you are therefore disqualified! :))  So - don't give up just cos you're old and the judge is 5.  Brandi: It's 2 winners we'll be needing]**  The judge will be Brandi, the 5 year old daughter of CassieWilber (winner of a pizza pie today).    I'll send a $25 pizza coupon to whoever Brandi decides looks like the nicest person based on their smile.  Her decision is final.  I don't care if you've won a pizza every day you've logged in, if you can convince her you're the nicest entrant based on your smile, then you're about to win another.  This contest will be decided tomorrow at 5pm PDT.  Cassie, let me know if that's too late for your little girl and I'll move it earlier.  So put up pics of you with your best smile.  Also include a sign saying hi to Brandi.  She's your judge and it is she who will award the prize!  My only restriction is that the sign is a requirement to demonstrate the pic is of you and taken for the contest.  Good luck to all you all!	True

It's been a long time since we've had anything GOOD to eat actually! In August, we had to move our mobile home, because they sold the mobile home park we were living in. It cost us an arm & leg, with moving expenses, deposits, etc! Being upfront about it - yes, we recieve food stamps. We had to eat out of a cooler for a week though, which took a huge chunk of our food stamps for the month (as we had to buy convienence foods and ice for the cooler) and we have really ran short this month. We recieve our food stamps on the 6th of the month, but until then, we are really struggling!! There are 7 of us (5 children, 2 adults) -- but my main concern is feeding my babies!! Thanks bunches!!

t3_k3lyq	1315068339.0	TheGreatGildersleeve	shroom	A big thanks to **Sierraechowhiskey** for his generosity and a behind the slice look at why it meant so much to me. [*Warning: Wall of text ahead*]	Let me warn you, this is pretty long and personal so skip this if you don't want to read that kind of stuff. Instead of telling my sob story in my request for pizza, I'm going to tell it now that we've eaten because I want to go beyond a mere thank you and give you all some perspective into the difference one giver made for my family and why it's wasn't just the pizza that helped us, but the emotional lift that came from feeling at the end of my rope only to find a generous stranger reach out and throw me and my kids a lifeline.  From the minute I posted my pizza request last night I felt a nervous pit in my stomach and the urge to just delete it and forget about it. *"This is stupid, no one is going to buy you pizza, you look like an idiot, delete that post"* kept running through my mind.   I didn't delete my post though. Truth was, I really couldn't -- this is the part where I apologize to the ROAP community for not being entirely truthful; my request said we had an alternate dinner if the pizza didn't work out, but that was just because I didn't want to be one of those sob story posts, even if I actually had a sob story. We had generic hotdogs and ramen as a plan b, and maybe I should just said that, but I didn't want anyone to feel like I was using my kids to manipulate my way to free pizza. Instead I just said in my post our week was bad, and boy was it, actually the whole summer was bad.   This summer my children's mother was caught stealing my pain medication by my 14 yr old daughter, which led to the revealing of her addiction and betrayals. Their mother promptly cleared out my bank account, left town and then pretty much cut us out of her life. She doesn't pay any support and she doesn't even contact the kids.  My youngest turned 10 last week and didn't get so much as a card from her mother. On top of all this I suffer from an auto-immune disease where my body destroys the soft tissue between my joints and spine and it has reached the point where I am disabled and must use a wheelchair for anything other than a trip to the bathroom. I cannot stand for more than a minute so I even have to use a special chair just to shower.   And the icing on the cake is; this week we got evicted and have 8 days to move out.  When I said we needed something to brighten our week I wasn't kidding.  Anyway, the reason I am telling you this after the fact is because I wanted to let the givers and mods know just how much these acts of kindness really mean to some of us. When Sierraechowhiskey sent me a generous gift card so that I could buy my kids their favorite kind of pizza and root beer for our movie night, it wasn't just the pizza that made me so happy -- it was that someone, anyone cared enough to go above and beyond to do something nice for us. It's cliché to say something like this restores your faith, but honestly in my case that was true.   As my kids were digging in to the pizzas and trying out the different toppings they'd each picked they were laughing and goofing off and...well, they were kids without a care in the world - and that is something I could't give them myself last night. That was what Sierraechowhiskey really gave my family last night; joy. Almost instantly a little party broke out and my kids were having a blast. Seeing them like that moved me to the point where...well, let's just say the pizza had A LOT of onions!    Every parent thinks their kids are amazing, but really you'll have to take my word for it; they are awesome kids. I have two girls and a boy (14, 10, 13) and I never need to ground them, they never cause trouble, they are kind-hearted and sweet and funny and smart and interesting and inquisitive. I love sitting and talking with them. They are so creative and talented and you'd never see that typical teenage "too cool for school" attitude from them. They clean their room and do their chores without asking and no matter how bad things get they never complain. They are the kind of kids that when there was only one piece of sausage pizza left last night, my son asked to make sure his sisters didn't want it before he took it. They deserve so much more than I can give them right now, but for one night we lacked for nothing, we had each other, a great movie, and delicious pizza sent by someone whose generosity made those pizza the best we've ever had.  So thank you Sierraechowhiskey and thanks you mods, and really thanks to everyone that gives and makes this community such an amazing place.  I am so grateful and inspired by you all. I don't have the money to pay it forward right now, but I do have other ways I can contribute and so as I move this week I will continue going through my things and trying to find items that match need posts over on r/assistance and r/favors. Between extra clothes and winter coats me and my kids no longer wear to things my ex doesn't want and some furniture and tech stuff I no longer need, I really hope that I can be a positive part of the community soon even if it's in small ways.  TL/DNR: Sierraechowhiskey is awesome and sometimes pizza makes me cry.  EDIT: Thanks everyone for your kind words and wishes! I was just going through some pictures and I came across two of my favorites, this one I took of my littlest after she danced around the backyard during a rain shower, http://i.imgur.com/hbiPX.jpg she's soggy but cute and the next one is with me and the kids http://i.imgur.com/M1pFg.jpg" huddled together.

You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's.

t3_k1yom	1314927475.0	throwawayscared		[DESPERATE REQUEST: Las Vegas] A year ago, I wrote an IAMA that is ranked 100th all time about how incompetent I was at my network security job. Today, I got fired. 	My AMA was titled [IAMA wildly incompetent network security admin and have no business in my job. AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cuc07/iama_wildly_incompetent_network_security_admin/)  If you goto [/r/IAMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/top/?sort=top&count=75&t=all&after=t3_akrna) (link is already sorted) select "All time" and sort by "Top" you'll see it's ranked exactly #100.  The job was a nice run, but honestly I enjoyed writing the AMA more than I enjoyed my job.  It was soul crushing be so worthless and being paid for it. I know that sounds hard to believe, but I assure you, it's the truth.  At any rate, I'm depressed, but I'm excited to finally be free.  I will be going back into computers most likely, but something that I'm actually good at. Troubleshooting, help desk, etc.  Certainly not network security.    FWIW, i was actually laid off by the executives, not fired for incompetence.  My wife is out of town and she doesn't even know yet.  It's just me and my 3 kids hanging out tonight.  Anyone feel like sending a few medium pizzas our way?  The thank you pictures will be marvelous indeed.  Of course I can't show our faces, since the IAMA is rather incriminating... :)  I'm not proud, but I'm not ashamed!   edit:  It'll be [hot dogs and blueberry bagels](http://i.imgur.com/k2SlM.jpg) if nobody wants to help this worthless secadmin in another 30 min or so.  After that, I'll just delete this post. Last thing I need is to have more eyes gandering at that AMA when I start job hunting! :) 2nd edit:  well I'll call it for tonight.  I sincerely appreciate anyone that read this and considered Randoming a pizza to me, even if you decided against it.  Just the thought is worth it in my book.  We ate some dogs and bagels so we're g2g for tonight.  Thanks so much to everyone.   **EDIT:  I withdraw my request for a pizza.  There's others that deserve it more.  The fact that I was paid for a job that I was horrible at does make me feel like I shouldn't be asking for a pizza.  My family and I will be fine.  i appreciate all the offers.  **  **I ask that if you really were going to get me a pizza today, you instead get one for "halohoppe".  He obviously has such low opinions of majority of humanity that I think everyone would be better off if his faith was restored slightly. I'll admit I was upset when he posted twice about what a scumbag I am, and how I just like free shit, but he's right.  I do like free shit, and I was paid to be in a job that i was not fit for.  i had other duties and continued to work, and had a great boss who was more of a friend.  I have no reason to feel sorry for myself..  Please, get a pizza for halohoppe.  Maybe it will motivate him to pass it forward and actually earn that pizza slice next to his username before bashing others**	True

t3_k1w5v	1314922670.0	snang	SM	Our friend SpeakerCity.	Just wanted to make everybody aware, we have an active member in RAoP, he's given a few times but continues to be a complete and utter asshole when enforcing his "pizza vigilante justice."  He was already banned once, he created a fake account under "Lashback" and scammed a girl on purpose to try and make a point.  After threatening to reinstate his ban, he promised he would do the same again.  I quote:  >**from SpeakerCity (_) [+3] sent 11 minutes ag**o >Ha, you should see my comments in r/politics. Of course, r/politics is frequented by real redditors, the kind that have thicker skin that the sensitive drama queens of raop. I put no effort into being rude on RAOP. I tell it like it is. If a person is wrong, I'll tell them. > >You know what'll happen if I get banned. RAOP will have one less repeat giver and one more habitual requester. > >I hope you banned the guy who said "shut your fucking mouth to me.  Just wanted to share this piece of immature bullshit with the generous RAoP community.  This is the dumb shit the moderators are forced to deal with.  We do this in our spare time.  I work 60 hours a week.  So thanks to SpeakerCity for being a complete and utter shitbag and making our lives needlessly difficult.

WOW! the ironic part is that because my daughter's boyfriend cut his toe open visiting his mom in mexico, he wasn't allowed back to his manager job at mcdonalds for awhile and they've been really poor since rent is due. they've been scrounging for anything to take to college with them and coming up short.   well, with that card and the coupons i got here, they were able to get 4 large pizzas and a pasta bowl for my little honor student as well! they can now take pizza to school for few days while they wait for his next check on the 6th, and i hope to help her tomorrow as well, so thanks to sarah's awesome gift, they have one less worry! so to say thank you, here's some pics she sent for you sarah...  http://imgur.com/DOdi7    all the food they were able to get, and notice the cute flowers on the table from the dollar store? hehe  http://imgur.com/yzQky   their roommate/coworker/friend  and my daughter's boyfriend 15 year old brother they took in for school  http://imgur.com/bCzLJ    my daughter heather and boyfriend marcos with the pizza heart they made to thank you from bottom of their hearts!

If you think they are a scammer, gather evidence and message the mods with it.  We will **not** tolerate witch hunts, and this is how they begin.

This is me and this is my life:( 20 years old just Started working at Walmart & doing other odd jobs all while taking care of my little brother and my mother. My little brother just got back from foster care 2 weeks ago. I have given up on going to college and decided to just make the best out of what life has given me. Im tired and too young to be going through this shit right now. I do not have a social life for someone my age but thats okay because my main Goal was to get my brother back and take care of him so he can stay with me. Does anyone understand what it feels like to have so many responsibilities at such a young age? Or to have someone like my brother ask me for something like pizza or Mcdonalds but I can't buy it for him because we can't afford it?

I'm thinking of my favorite brand and flavor of sausage. Whoever can guess it *exactly* gets $15 of free pizza from the chain of their choosing. An example guess might be "What are Jimmy Dean Maple Links?" (please phrase all guesses as questions, Jeopardy style).  Also, if you don't get a positive response, you're wrong and should continue trying :D  EDIT: We have a winner! smegma_enigma accurately guessed "What is Aidell's Pineapple and Bacon smoked chicken sausage"!

t3_jvhw2	1314391916.0	jj7921		Bit of advice for you college students out there	I work for student affairs in my college. (The people that create events for you on the campus, and usually the people you have to deal with when you get in trouble or have problems)   I learned this in undergrad but if you are ever in need for pizza, there is more than likely an event that has pizza for you to eat. I rarely had to eat my own food because there is usually an event even on the weekend that can provide you food or pizza ESPECIALLY the first few weeks of school.   BUT the thing about this is, you have to go out and meet people this what you have to give back for the free pizza or food, but trust me, its worth it!

His partner and mother of his two youngest children and stepmother raising all of his kids is Elizabeth is 26.  On Thursday July 21, 2011 John went to the Santa Rosa Hospital downtown for what was thought to be a routine issue from his diabetes and was subsequently diagnosed with Acute Lymophatic Lukemia Stage 4. This family was shaken to the core with the news. They have begun Chemotherapy and the family goes daily to the hospital but the cost of gas,oil etc... and keeping their old van running and still having the normal bills has drained them.  I ask today for prayers for this family and for those of you who are able, a donation to help get the school kids ready for the upcoming school year and to help this family meet their needs, and for final expenses should the outcome be fatal. The family is near Walmart, HEB, Family Dollar, Dollar General and tries to shop economically. I thank you for your generosity and your prayers and may this family and each of you who read this be blessed.  I have set up a bank account for donations and the information is below.

t3_jtufu	1314260655.0	boat_thief		grounded, humbled, and hungry for some pie.	As much as this amazingly generous subreddit has interested me over the last year or so, I never thought I would be the one to request some help. I'll keep this short because I don't want it to turn into a sob story.  I live in the Phoneix area, and a few months ago I got a DUI for driving around to the back of a bar to carpool with friends so none of us would get pulled over for driving while heavily intoxicated, which, with the exception of a select few DD's, we all really were. But I digress.  Fast forward a few months, and here I sit. Alone in my apartment, fresh outta Joe Arpaio's Tent City, under home detention for two weeks. My first day I can leave outside of my work release is next Tuesday for errands, groceries, and laundry. Either way, because of all of the fines and fees, I find myself looking at an empty fridge till next friday's payday, and frankly, I'm in need of some saucy, cheesy love.  I've rambled far enough. I know this is random, but it's worth a shot; looking at my situation now, I can't wait until I can be on some more stable feet in a few months so that I can repay the favor...even if no pizza comes my way. Although, it does sound pretty delicious.   I know it's late, PM if you're interested in donating. Going to bed with a rumbly tummy, but looking forward to tomorrow :) thanks ROAP.

Don't tell her but she was pretty silly acting when she got home. I was wondering if someone will help me surprise her with pizza tomorrow? We had sandwiches and ramen tonight. Yes we do have food but it was just easy stuff to make so mom didn't have to worry about it. We made homemade pizza not too long ago and she loved it. We just don't have the stuff right now and can't get to the store until this week end. Mom has to be off her feet for one week and my dad cant drive because of a disability. We entered a contest on here and we won a pizza,that was so much fun! I know what RAOP is all about and if someone needs a pizza don't pick me to help, we won't go hungry I just think mom would like a surprise and I want to show her I appreciate everything about her. I can take pictures of her bandage but I don't think I can open it to show the stitches. She said they cut her from her baby toe to her ankle. EESSHH I don't think I want to see that. Ok this isn't one of those sob stories I just wanted everyone on here to know she had surgery. She loves this place and we can't wait until she can work again because she said then we get to do contests and give pizza to others.  Thank You! Chris

I received a pizza from yah_turkey [over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jsc0f/offer_free_hot_pizza_easy_baked_crust/) from Pizza Hut a little bit ago. When the delivery guy arrived, he said the cardholder needed to be present with ID to receive the order. Obviously yah_turkey wasn't at my house so nothing could be done. The driver had me call the manager and explain the story and I told him about RAoP and whatnot. The manager basically told me 'too bad, fuck off.' Luckily my friend woke up and had enough change to cover the pizza. Just thought I should warn you guys so no hungry/broke people get teased with a pizza they won't be able to receive. I'm also not sure if any other chains have this policy.

My GFs account shows 1 withdrawal and 1 deposit, so even. Mine however, shows [this](http://i.imgur.com/dyxDK.png).

My poverty is my own doing, and will be rectified at least temporarily once my student loans come (my school never is on time with the shit).  Anyway, before I get my things together to go out and apply places, i'd like to have something to eat other than the hotdogs and grilled cheeses i've been eating for the last couple weeks (I actually love them, i'm easy to please, it's just been repetitive).

t3_jrtvw	1314117796.0	Yme111	shroom	(request) desperate embarrassing but have to ask!	Hi I am using my computer at work to make this request. I get paid next week and my family and I need groceries so bad. We have almost made it as this is my 2nd week back to work in over a year and a half after being laid off. I am scared and worried about food constantly and really need a pizza for my family. If someone can help, please let me know and I will provide you with all the proof and information you may need. This is very embarrassing to ask but I have to swallow my pride and do this not only for myself but for my family. 	True
t3_jrtoy	1314117490.0	Kayleemarie17		Request for a pizza please. (USA)	I'm a single teen mother and things are very tight . My son and I could really use a pizza rightnow  . I could verify anyway. Please let me know if you can help it would be much appreciated . And when I have the funds I promise to give back! 	
t3_jrr7j	1314113029.0	DEStudent	PIF	Have a little Faith... A special thank you to marx1st!	So I made a request last night. I was honest- I received before, I burnt meatloaf and my IBS was flaring. And I know how some of us are- we're naysayers. Sometimes we get so tired of the beggers, we become cold and callous. And sometimes there are trolls and spammers. But I want to remind us all to have little faith. I got a PM saying the person saw my request and wanted to get me a pizza. I submitted all my info and verification. This kind soul was in the process of asking what I wanted and then said she was going to send me a gift card instead. I thanked her and waited and checked my email and spam and no giftcard. I sent her a few messages after an hour noting the problem and that I hadn't received anything. No messages back. It was late and I laid down. I still hadn't received anything. I didn't get angry or upset. So after I woke up later this morning, I was going through my emails that came in, while I was asleep. And TaDa! I had a gift card from **marx1st!**  I want to thank her so much for her kindness and generosity but also to remind us all- sometimes we need to have a little faith. That's for the givers and receivers. **Not everyone is out to scam especially those who received more than 1x.** Sometimes a person is just really in a bad situation. And for the receivers, be honest, be patient and remember no one here owes you **Anything!** Its up to the donor to decide what criteria they want to use. Thank you **marx1st** in more ways than you know. You just never know who's life you may be effecting-just by offering a pizza. I love you all RAOP and I will be *paying it forward* next month. Please make sure marx1st gets her icon because she really deserves it!   *Edit*- Here's the link to my Pizza Feast   http://s1229.photobucket.com/albums/ee478/RMS913/	True

t3_jrndo	1314105437.0	Rollout	Rollout	A word about commenting on someones request for verification.	I see a trend starting again. There is no need for 4 people (or more than one) to ask someone for proof of their situation. Further, there is no need in asking someone to verify if you are not prepared to purchase them a pizza.  I actually removed some inappropriate comments from one request this morning, where 5 people asked for more evidence of a situation. I know that all 5 people were not going to buy this person a pie. Further these people made fun of the posters situation in a way that would have made my blood boil if I was that person and the story is true.  A suggestion from one person is welcome, such as "you should offer proof via pm to someone who offers" or such.   The verification is up to the giver. No lynch mobs in posts.

t3_jr01x	1314048875.0	SuperNatural9765		Hello Reddit!	I found this site here- http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/slice-kindness-13951936  I think it's amazing what you all do!  I was really iffy about this at first, because I wasn't sure it was legit.  I was also iffy about posting because it seems like there is a huge scam going on which truly makes me sad, that is why the world is the way it is..  It appears that newer people don't have chance due to that reason, but I thought I'd give it a try anyways and I will definitely stick around too. I enjoyed reading all the interesting things, and I've learned and discovered over the past few hours more then I ever have in my whole life time.  Anyways I'm not going to make a sob story but the truth is, I went over in my bank account, I'm usually pretty well at managing my money and I make a decent amount of money to not have to worry about these things, but my sister was really close to losing her home and she has a 6 year old daughter, and I couldn't let that happen. I emptied my whole saving to help her out, I have a son of my own who I care for, I asked her to pay me 200$ back which she agreed to, which is way less then what she received from me, she has payed none back. Not only am I disappointed in her but she is leaving me and my son without which is not cool.   I try my best not to ask for help, I don't get government assistance and work hard for my money. I am asking if someone can help me out until tomorrow with anything. I will pay it back and if verification is needed I can provide it.

t3_jqrbd	1314033993.0	haleigh321		Girls Group Home could use a little love on first day back to school	EDIT: Because the home does rely on donations we do not have the funds to take the girls out to eat, and some have lived here for almost a year without going out or getting take out. Just an afterthought since someone asked me.  Hi everyone My name is Haleigh and I work as a volunteer at a girls group home in Coral Springs, Florida. We have 8 girls here ranging in age from 12-17. They are here for a variety of different reasons ranging from being taking away from their families because of abuse and are currently in the court system to being homeless. Today was their first day back to school after the summer. Some girls have been here for a while and some are new and not quite use to the routine. It is their responsibilty to make dinner for themselves on a rotating basis and clean the kitchen afterwards. Our home relies on donations so what they have for dinner varies. I thought it would be a nice idea to ask if someone would like to treat these girls to dinner tonight and be a shining star for them as you could imagine they have been through a lot. I see the emotional rollercoaster ride they are on and it would mean a lot to them to be able to take a break and relax for the evening.  	True
t3_jqilw	1314015381.0	lacylola	shroom	Givers, read this...	In the wake of all the talk about scammers here, I just wanted to raise one point. You givers are what makes this place awesome, not the people you give it to.   When you give something like this, you are changing something in you for the better. You will reap rewards of increased self esteem, warm and fuzzies, and real life karma. Yes, might be getting scammed by someone who doesn't NEED the pizza or whose story isn't true, but that doesn't change how awesome YOU ARE for giving, how much we love seeing you give, and how much we love you for it.   Don't get discouraged. Your kindness and generosity warm the hearts and bellies of the subscribers of RAOP. Just because a few bad apples fuck the system, doesn't diminish your greatness.  <3

t3_jq9rp	1313987322.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	Thoughts on giving and finding recipients	A growing problem here seems to be how to find people to give to who are less likely to be scammers.   I've been thinking for awhile (and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/jpkje/whats_your_personal_fuck_my_life_story/) helped cement the thoughts) that perhaps we could search outside of RAoP for recipients. Find somone on reddit that looks like they need cheering up, contact them and point them to the fact that you're from RAoP and offer them a pizza (if they meet criteria, etc). Posting could still be done on RAoP announcing the gift, etc. Details to be sorted out by someone with more time.  It's just an idea - what do people think?  **Edit:** As pointed out by meteorliath, this would be in addition to, not instead of the current set up in RAoP. 	True

t3_jotm5	1313846690.0	MeeNinjaTurtle		(Request) Portland, OR ~ Does early redditor get the worm aka pizza? No mean people invited to my post...	In a nutshell, i've been reading requests, offers, and comments and there are alot of nice giving people and alot of mean people; if you are mean and judgemental stop reading and go to another post. I decided to give this a try and see if I will survive... I am the oldest of 6 children, i'm 19, and we are a family of 8. I know, BIG family. Anyways, I wouldn't have it any other way as I have enjoyed having my younger brothers and sisters to pick on but we never got or get to have pizza as a family because when my parents buy one it is never enough for all of us so I would like to have a couple of pizzas to enjoy with my family where we don't have to be reminded that we can only have one slice of pizza because WTF, who gets full with one slice. Also, my parents are not on any assistance which would be great for us but they are struggling financially. If someone can help great, if not, thank you anyways. We do have junk food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies but no PIZZA. Dominoes will work if anyone is interested in helping me surprise my family. Thanks

t3_joexx	1313799897.0	backpackwayne		I would like to make a public apology to Reillyboy	In the mist of a lynch mob yesterday I was  being pounded with one question after another. Regardless of that conversation which is now over, I was told by someone that Reillyboy had made a threat to another user that he would destroy him. After careful checking and  looking for the link where this happened, that person found out it was not Reillyboy who had made that comment. The comment was made but **NOT** by Reillyboy.   So I hereby apologize specifically to Reilllyboy for passing on information that turned out to be incorrect. I also apologize to Allieoop who insisted I was wrong but I insisted I was right. It turns out I was wrong. I also apologize to your community if I have caused you any trouble for this mistake.  I wish RAOP the best of luck and hope that you will continue to support it.   Your moderator Rollout is a great person I apologize for any trouble this has caused him and this community.  backpackwayne	True

t3_joaj3	1313790296.0	kristekitty		YAY BADBROWNIE!	so badbrownie sent me a giftcard, for no reason except he's awesome, which i told him i would use to buy my daughter and her boyfriend lunch when they drove down. they made a 200 mile round trip for sole purpose of taking me to store with my food stamps, and i discovered the money i'd set aside for their lunch would have to be spent on going back to college costs. i was miserable, having given away pizza i'd won since i had that money, until badbrownie came along and insisted on giving me card just because...  they didn't want it. she said keep it for my going back to school. and i was kind of sad, thinking about donating it. especially after she went to walmart.com and tried to get me school supplies and cheap clothes, though she's having trouble getting her card to work. she did that for me but wouldn't take the card.  until yesterday! her boyfriend has moved his little brother in with them and it was his 15 birthday. he had friends over and they wanted to get him pizza and cake but couldn't afford all that. until she remembered badbrownies awesome gift. they were able to get four pizzas for them and his guests, AND a cake as well! i told them to get pics but she misunderstood so sent a pic of pizzas on floor. then one of roommate with folded pizza in his mouth. and they were able to get them for only a few bucks over card amount with all the coupons you folks have posted!    http://imgur.com/Y4LG4  http://imgur.com/YaWTT  and this is them saying hi....  http://imgur.com/1O0hu  so again, thank you badbrownie for helping me not only say thank you to them for driving all the way here just to help, but for helping them make his little brother's bday a great one!

Still they treated him like garbage and wouldnt even let him do his job. He worked in the training area all day! What an insult when they knew it wasn't him all along. It was just punishment for missing work due to an injury that he got in their shop. Overall it was a bad day.

I've tried to give a few times before but haven't been successful. However, it's only a potential offer because there are a few critera that you need to satisfy:  * be awesome (within my definition of awesome) * don't be annoying (some sob stories are extremely annoying. some make me want to give you pizza for breakfast, lunch and dinner. do you know which is which?) * be a redditor of substantial lineage (i.e. no newbies) * be in need of pizza (money is tight these days, and I'd like to help people LESS fortunate than me, not more fortunate) * be real (happy to do verification, etc) * be Australian (my card doesn't work for overseas transactions)  There probably isn't anyone out there who will satisfy this criteria, given that there aren't many Aussies in need.

My name is Julia and I am now living in a shelter in North Philly. I live with about 20 or 30 other women, and it would brighten up our day if we could get a pizza or two. I know a few friends of mine at the shelter would love to share with me.  before you ask, I used to live in South Philly and had problems with my landlord. I had to leave and ended up in NYC with a friend. Then, I came back to Philly and ended up in a shelter. I'm broke and we'd really appreciate a pizza. it would brighten our day.

t3_jjonk	1313438158.0	badbrownie	brownie	Go Forth Young Pizza-Givers...	I'm going to try something a bit different and welcome others to consider it too.  I am one of those people who'd like to feed a needy and worthy person/family but HATES the thought of some prick laughing to himself as he scams me and turns a good deed into thievery.    So I'm going to wander away from RAOP and go award a pizza to someone unsuspecting.    I just figure that the thieves:needy ratio in the requests on RAOP is higher than I'm comfortable with.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe there's really only one would-be thief per day, but I doubt it.    So I'm off.  Will post results in this subreddit of course.	
t3_jjlbh	1313432490.0	Yme111	shroom	People are cruel and should not be so quick to judge!!	So you don't like the fact that someone is new, or has a sob story and then decide that person is not worthy. Well thats not fair. I put in 2 request, offered to pay it forward, and got no help just because a few redditors decide that I am not up to their standards. Well I have news for you, my story is leggit and I do have children and a dog, and as a matter of fact I started my new job today, though it was only 4 hours of orientation and filling out paperwork. the fact is that being hateful can hurt people. I know there are people on here who make up stories, but I also know that people like me and my family really are hurting. In fact we only ate once yesterday and I have not eaten at all today. but I'm sure you dont want to hear my sob story about that. Just think next time before you are so quick to judge someone. maybe one day you might find yourself hungry and would not want someone to judge you. EDIT: This is only my opinion on my experience here on RAOP Your opinion and your experience may differ. I did not Mean for this to become a bitchfest Nor did I mean for this to offend anyone. I was just mearly pointing out the fact that some people have no idea what a person is really going thru and should not be so quick to judge as some people really are Hungry and do need help with food, etc....

t3_jj9y3	1313408831.0	MobiusOneTwo		To Have Electricity or Eat... Tough Choices.	UPDATE Aug-15-2011 12:37 PM ET: Request fulfilled by ILP61. :-) I thank all of you for your kindness and generosity. As well as your comments. It's been relieving just to even talk about my situation. -- I will admit, I am a very prideful, I suppose, person. I find myself unable to ask for help unless absolutely necessary, and as such, I never thought I'd be doing this, but I'm at the end of the rope. The electric man finally after months of partial payments sent me the red shutoff notice. I had hoped to find some extra money some how before today, but I was unsuccessful and had no choice but to spend my last money on the electric bill before it was shut off tomorrow.  A pizza would be wonderful. It would be amazing. It would be a change from the popcorn I've been eating for days.  I offer this as proof of story: http://picpaste.com/displaypdfbill-1-LQk4rSkG.png  I live near Ann Arbor, MI with a Pizza Hut within walking distance, and Domino's not far either.  I will say, in the interest of full disclosure, that I do have another reddit account. However, it has never made a RAOP request and I will provide the SN in a private setting, if necessary.	True

And I was given it by a user who would like to remain anonymous and I will honor their wishes but just know that you are loved and appreciated. You gave my family dinner for a night and stopped all of the problems for an hour and I appreciate that.    Now then for the shout-out. Paulinator (I hope I spelled that right) messaged me even after I edited my post saying thank you but I already received the pizza however if you feel obliged still I gave him my email. Well after a few day of not hearing anything I figured he had decided not to which didn't bother me because I had lots of left over that lasted me up till today. And then after watching an episode of breaking bad I come upstairs and look at my email to see a dominoes gift card. This literally made my day! (aside from the epic breaking bad episode) I'm going to save it for when I need it but it just goes to show that there are a lot of kind people on the internet (specifically reddit) that care. So thank you Anonymous User (you know who you are) and Thank you Paulinator. My family and I extend out gratitude to you both! And someday when we aren't financially screwed I hope to extend the favor to others :)

t3_ji332	1313282120.0	bgoldman86	pizza	I think I was scammed on RAOP	I posted a RAOP that was pretty successful, giving out five pizzas (http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jcjzb/offer_vegan_pizza/). One poster, who said her name was Kellie and went by the username kiwi061216, posted a sad story about how she has two young boys and she can't afford to feed them. Her account was new and she had made many posts in RAOP trying to get pizza, but none were successful. I felt sorry for her and asked her to post a picture as proof, because if her story was true, I would be happy to buy her and her two young boys some food. As proof, she posted a picture of her with her two boys, with a sign that said "Hi Reddit! We love spinach and black olives." (http://i.imgur.com/oqt0Z.jpg)  So of course I bought some pizza (two pizzas and some soda, to be specific), and she said she was so thankful, and would post pizza pictures. She never ended up posting the pizza pictures, and recently I just checked and saw that her account is now deleted, and her posts are deleted as well.  I feel kind of scammed now :( I'm not going to stop giving out free pizzas, but I thought I would share this experience. Also, for the record, the other four recipients of free pizza from me were all very thankful and did post pizza pictures :)

In my previous posts you will see that I have three children and am married.  I know that this will probably be questioned because my last post stated that my youngest was up sick with a stomach bug.  This time my oldest who is 8 was just diagnosed with Shingles.  He is starting to feel better although the rash is still hurting at times.  I have been struggling with depression myself, and I am guessing that no one will really believe my sob story.  I know there are so many people out there who request pizzas so I understand if no one really cares about me.  I am not trying to guilt someone into feeling bad for me but my guess is thats how it is going to be perceived.  I am very open and honest if you have any questions.  Sorry if my post annoys anyone.

Everything would have been fine except later that night we ran to a store downtown and there was no parking, at all. So we parked in a pay lot that was suppose to be free after 6 pm, and it was waaaay after 6. We weren't even in there 20 mins, and come back out to find our car has been impounded!! We have to spend every last penny we had to get a cab and get our car back. The tow place said we could take it up with the people who own the lot. Yeah right was the look he gave us. Plus we had just got paid yesterday, so now we literally have no money, and we didn't even get to buy groceries or anything! My fiancee is mad at himself for parking there and I am kicking myself for wanting to go to the store in the first place! I just gave out a pizza last night before we left, and this totally buzz killed it! I don't know what we are going to do for the next 2 weeks.. But anything that will cheer up my S/O would be great. I will be ok if he will just stop being so grumpy! Even my daughter is cranky today! Please help me cheer my family up!!

However, what those tools can't do is come up with a fake IP that is in their own town (and be definition, they wouldn't want to).  So - how about we add an extra line to the verification page that shows the town/city of the IP address to shave off one extra layer of scamming scum.	True
t3_jhixd	1313217835.0	dunlopturtle		Help with buying a giftcard? 	I just promised to give pizza, but it isn't allowing me to buy a giftcard, because I live in Australia. Does anyone know a way around this, so i can send out the pizza?	
t3_jhiiu	1313216662.0	blaurum	shroom	Question for you all!	In a few short weeks, I'm going to be paying it forward with a couple of things.  Do you guys prefer contests or just offerings to first come first serve?  I'm trying to decide how I want to do this. (Though there are a couple people who helped me out that I want to pay it forward to already)    I've never offered a pizza, so I want to make sure I do it the right way and a fair way when the time comes.	
t3_jhgld	1313210824.0	badbrownie	brownie	First Offer.  $20 worth of pizza for a couple of worthy redditors	**One Pizza Down.  One To Go**   Please use the [verification system](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/) and have more than 300 in karma.  If you have a kid (under 18) that you can take a pic with showing a pizza drawing then I'll feed you both tonight.    Be prepared to share your real world address and the topping you prefer  and time you'd like it delivered.  I'm happy to order from a local pizzeria if you prefer.  Happy eats!  EDIT: bedtime for tonight.  Will pick thjs up again tomorrow  EDIT2: Back up and at 'em and abuckfiddy is our first winner.  One more pizza coming...	True
t3_jhg1s	1313209332.0	badbrownie	brownie	what different ways do you use to do verification?	I saw the verification system (though I'm not clear on why my knowing their email address is verifying anything except their ability to sign up with yahoo.  What am I missing?).  But besides, karma and past comments, what other ways do 'offerers' here use when they wish to ensure they're feeding the needy and not the scammers?  Also, is there really a problem with not being able to use a credit card because the deliverer needs to see it?  Or is that a very rare occurrence?  Looking to get started on feeding people but feel like I need to be 'trained' first! :)	
t3_jhdvm	1313204021.0	helpmoquick	shroom	~Request~ Senior Mom & grown disabled daughter are hungry..	Hi everyone.. I have been here before.. in the same situation only this time is a bit worse.  It's only the middle of the month, but our $$ is already gone. After the rent and all the bills we usually have just enough to get by with food/toiletries/gas, etc., but I just got a ticket for my registration being out (literally 6 days late). So I had to have the car inspected, registered and pay off the ticket.  It completely wiped out my checking account.. I've got $4.21 left for the month. I intend to search out local food banks, etc., but if tonight we can have something hot and filling, I would be most grateful.  I know others have it hard too, but all I can do is promise to pay-it-forward if & when the opportunity presents itself.  My deepest thanks for taking the time to read this guys :)

Here is everything that I have been going through for the past month  i went back to the hospital because of suicadal and depression...(Ive already been once, and this time got diagnosed with bipolar)  gave me a shit tons of medicatinos, (I find out later that were all outdated,  and all had adverse side effects with each other) missed 3 imporant auditions (I am an actor, missed 1 theater audition and two major film auditions, batman and Avengers)'  As soon as I get released from the hospital, I get a nagging throbbing pain in my side, turns out to be a kidney stone, start pissing blood that wont stop for three week  then drove up to CPH (Cleveland Playhouse) for a callback for their first downtown show (Really big deal in Cleveland) while dealing with a kidney stone on my way there from Parents house, which is  a two hour drive my car broke down so every 20 miles i had to get out, fill it up with water in the heatwave so i just got more dehydrated which is awful for kidney stones, and just made things incredibly difficult and uncomfortable.  get there to the audition all sweaty, delarious, and dehyrdated fucked up that audition drove home, same 20 mile bullshit go home, get the worst pain of my entire life, THE WORST PAIN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE. Google Kidney stone pain.  While I was in the hospital, I lost my job, (which later turns into cutting hours) because they don't think I am "reliable and stable", so due to this, I can't pay rent on a new place, and my lease is up August 1st, so I have to move back home.  Work decides to give me hours, but only 20hrs a week, and from my parents house, its over an hour and 15 min away.  then my 2cd week back at work, i got attacked again by kidney stones got yelled at again from my boss because I "should have seen the stone coming and not went to work: Go to the ER, and urologist and they tell me  i have to wait 19 days to get a CT scanto see whats wrong with my kidneys Get  an email form my old landlord basically saying im not getting my deposit back.  And last night, TO TOP EVERYTHING OFF, someone broke into my truck.   I've passed 3 kidney stones, My kidneys are sore, Im pissing blood, I am broke, Im depressed, and lonely, and would love a pizza for the steeler game tonight. I live around Akron Ohio.  Thanks, sorry for the really long read.

t3_jh4xv	1313183092.0	jetboyterp	jetboyterp	An open letter to RAoP...	Just wanted to say I really am glad I happened across this subreddit.  Only about 3 weeks ago...was directed here by one of those sidebar ads on the front page.  Lurked for a bit, then...as I had a little extra dough (not pizza dough tho) I ordered a few pies for some peeps who needed a hot meal.    It's very cool that everyone here is active.  Givers, receivers, and regulars like kristekitty (as RAoP cheerleader...love that) and a bunch of others makes this a "happy" place to hang out for a bit.  And as anyone knows, pizza has the power to brighten up even the most down and depressed person's day.  You can't be sad or pissed off while munchin' on a good pie.  And this subrettit rules simply because of the people here involved...and of course the mods.  I'm glad to have become a small part of this little group, and hope to see it expand as much as it can.    This really is a great idea, and a great group.  In spite of a few trolls and scammers.  But they seem to me to be a small minority at RAoP, and I know the mods are good at trying to stay on top of that.   So cheers, RAoP!

First person to guess wins. All guesses after saturday (starting sunday) will be invalid and I probably wont get the gifting of the pizza setup until the day after you guess the right number. I have a lot of things to do this weekend including a wedding.	
t3_jgpx5	1313153858.0	gabby4		tough month - could use something yummy for the kids tonight	I am new here - someone just told me about this place today, so I thought I would check it out.  Our family is having a tough month - first my husband was injured on his job (that doesn't pay much of anything anyhow and that he has to drive an hour each way for!). He was put on light duty which meant less hours for him too.   Then he had to leave for a week to do his residency for school and had to take the time unpaid.   He is a full time student in his Ph.D. program.   I would love to have a nice easy meal for the kids tonight - after seeing how small my hubby's check was this week I had to call the finance company for our van and tell them that I can't pay it. I am just too stressed to think about food.   Thanks for reading :)	
t3_jgoyj	1313150885.0	AskMeAboutUnicorns	pizza	I'm giving away some Domino's Pizza.  This evening. Please read before requesting.	I just got paid and I'm going to get pizza tonight, so I thought I'd give someone else pizza.  I know there are people here who try to scam, and others who are down on their luck.  Guess what?  I don't care.  You sob story me, you aren't getting a pie.  You aren't a true sports fan? HAH!  Your account is too young, no chance (and I don't care about your excuse).  I'm not an ass, but my brother gave yesterday and people got pissed because he gave to a guy who has gifted dozens of steam games to other redditors.  I don't care if you have 10 children, you shouldn't have given it up so easily.  I'm going to be giving a Dominos gift card to whoever wows me the most tonight at around 4 or 5.  There's a preseason game on tonight.  Guess right (or be a true fan, which is preferred though can't be easily sifted) and I'll have a better chance of choosing you.    When I come home from work, I will look through submissions and decide.  Best chance: don't be a dick, don't EVER whine about someone's financial situation, don't immediately ask for a PM, enjoy the team I like, and enjoy Pizza.  I'll PM one of you around 4 PM EST. Cheers.  EDIT:  OH!  Also, I'm a fucked up narcissist, so I would love a photo of you enjoying the gift.  That's not too much to ask right?  And if it's hilarious, I'm happier.  EDIT 2: HeeroJay broke the rules and provided a sob story (He or she's a Bills fan) but it was so funny that I decided to give the pizza card to him/her.  Thanks everyone for the great responses.  This was my first experience with RAOP and likely won't be my last.  Peace PepperBROnies!  EDIT 3: Also, I'm a Lions fan, if it wasn't painfully obvious.  Another one: I totally feel bad, HeeroJay waited patiently for his pizza while I fell asleep watching Futurama and forgot to phone in verify.  Well, don't I feel like a prick.  Either way, should be resolved now.  Edit again: [Mah boy HeeroJay enjoying his pizza](http://imgur.com/3QcAE.jpg)	True

WOW what a ride it has been!!! mostly down, but a few ups. I am both happy and scared at the same time. My family and I almost did not survive this, as it came down to the wire. I lost my home and moved to an apt, I lost my husband. ( good riddens ) because he thought money was more important then family. THE BRIGHT SIDE is I have my kids, my health and NOW look forward to a brighter future with all the suffering we have been through. Still a little bumpy and would appreciate it if a fellow Redditor can buy us a pizza to celebrate our new future. I WILL pay it forward with my 1st paycheck. and that is a promise!

When I posted my plight yesterday about not having anywhere to go except the fire station I work at, or any money for food, I honestly didn't think anyone would reply. There are people out there with kids to feed, so why would anyone help me?   But Twoscomplement sent me a 25$ pizza giftcard and tonight I ate dinner. I have enough pizza to last all of tomorrow and maybe part of the next day. I've been living on gatorade, water, and a disgusting intake of nutter butters and slim jims. (Firehouse cuisine!)  Twoscomplement, I want you to and everyone out there to understand just how much it meant to me. Life's been kicking me in the seat of my pants for a while now. Ive been angry and bitter. Ive felt so alone, no friends, and no one to turn to. It hurt me that I can work so hard to protect this city and the people in it, but still cannot afford to live in it.  This gift, though it might not seem like much to you, means the difference between getting dangerously weak while fighting fires this week, and going to sleep content, full, and not worried about what I'm going to do to eat.   I will pay you back, or pay it forward, whichever your prefer. And thank you. Again and again and again. THANK YOU!  [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/r6jXO.jpg[/IMG]

I also will have to sleep overnight with all my stuff on the street as we move out one day and can't move into our next house till the 2nd day. I dont mind being homeless for a day but my stomach does.  So anyways, I'm tired, hungry, and a friendly and random pizza would be a miracle.    I know I don't deserve it as a lot of these people but I would be forever indebted if you could help this poor, in debt, no kitchen, and no food redditor out!  I promise to pay one back when i get situated in my new house!  Thanks for any help you can

t3_jf70p	1313024607.0	Nowwhatdoyoumean		(REQUEST) Had the worst weekend; still reeling.	First off, long time lurker, just found out about this subreddit and thought maybe someone may be able to help. Over the weekend, I let a good friend of mine borrow my 1998 Ranger. He ended up drinking and driving and drove through a fence (and then on my rims around the block). Totaled it. It was the last thing my dad gave me and I can't afford repairs nor the tow for weeks. By the time I can get it out, it will be costing more than it's worth. I am still going to get it out and fix it, because it is sentimental. All I have to eat is rice for the next three weeks (maybe more); so, I'm not starving, but a pizza would really be a pick-me-up at this point.

t3_jezbp	1313010028.0	mclwlm	pizza	Would love a hot meal! University screwed me and no pay check until September 8th	I'm a part time research assistant with the Graduate School of Education at UC Berkeley, it pays the bills and gets me a little drunk come the weekend. However the university only pays its employees once a month, so a lot of budgetting in advance is required.   On monday I checked my bank statement and the direct deposit didn't go through, indeed there was no record of it at all. I went to payroll yesterday and inquired, they had no check for me. Turns out when my appointment was extended at the beginning of the summer it wasn't done in time for the July pay cycle. I filled out a new timesheet for July but no money until September (but that will be a fat double check!)  I'm 22, just graduated with debt out the ass (I was an out of state student so tuition was about as much as a prestigious private school) and no prospects (as of yet) for a solid full time job with a brand new kitten to take care of, his name is [Theodore](http://i.imgur.com/ZbN3W.jpg)  I have Cheerios, oatmeal, ramen, etc. so I'm not the most desperate, but it would be appreciated immensely. As soon as the double checks come through I'll be gifting 2 people with pizza of their own as a way to pay it forward for getting me through this low point. (And please, RAOP watchmen feel free to remind me if I forget)

Two amazing redditors responded to the call:  1. **ReillyBoy** went and bought two pizzas, plus cheesy bread and lava cakes (I absolutely love lava cakes). They exceeded above and beyond the call. I truly wasn't expecting so much food and I express how much I am grateful that ReillyBoy stepped in and provided food.  2. **jimwll**, who sent me a Papa John's gift card that will be put to good use and will keep me fed for the next week (or more).  I also want to thank all the mods, the people who upvoted my post and those that send me kind words of encouragement.  You have no idea how much you have made my day better.   So stay classy, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza and thank you for making a poor college student have hope!  *tl;dr*: Rollout asked me to help RAOP move to a flair system so that they could use the [Easy Flair tool](http://www.reddit.com/r/modhelp/comments/jc7q9/i_made_a_tool_that_makes_it_easier_to_give_users/) I wrote for Reddit moderators.

t3_je393	1312938186.0	spacitymedic	shroom	Hungry Firefighter Living in the Fire Station; Nowhere Else To Go.	I am a Fire Fighter/ EMT living in the central Arkansas area. I lost my full time job back in February after I requested some time off to take care of my mother, who was just released from the hospital after her second stroke. While on my two week leave I was fired, since Arkansas is a "right to work" state.... I call it "right to fire".   Anyways, I recently lost my place and I have nowhere to go. I asked all my friends and quickly found out that friendship is merely an equal exchange of goods and services, and I currently have nothing to offer... Apparently everything I did good for my friends was somehow negated by the request for a sofa for a couple nights.   My Chief at the Fire Department. that I work at part time, said I could stay at Station 1. It's the older building that is at the edge of our district, and we rarely pull trucks from it, unless there is a big fire, or we are providing mutual aid to another department. Its being remodeled right now, and is REALLY filthy. But it has a sofa bed, a shower and a toilet. I'm so thankful for it! So I have started cleaning and have offered my assistance with tiling the floors and hanging sheetrock.  Anyways, since I'm a paid-per-fire Fire Fighter, all my money goes to pay for my car (which I was sleeping in until my chief offered the station). And I don't have food stamps or the means of buying food. A pizza would really make my day. I'll eat anything but anchovies. (LOL Most firemen eat anything!)  I'd give my left leg for a big beefy sausagey pizza with a ton of cheese.  Thanks for reading, I really hope that someone gets this and is able to help me. God Bless You All!   Matthew 25:35-40

Not wanting to waste any, I saved some for lunch the next day, I just made sure the box was reclosed, the way it was delivered, it was fine. I put it on foil and put in the toaster oven on the highest setting, for maybe 7 minutes, it was perfect. The other 4 slices, I wrapped tightly in foil, by 2's, before we want to eat it, take from freezer and let thaw for maybe an hour and reheat the same way, perfect :)  The cinny sticks, I left in the box in the fridge, thenplaced them on foil for maybe 3 minutes on high in the toaster oven, I also nuked the icing for 10 seconds, perfect! With all the deals with codes and stuff, I thought I would share, the best way I have found to reheat and not waste any good pizza!

My friend told me about this site, and said that she had received a pizza when she was in need, and that it really helped her. I figured I would give it a try. I know I just registered on Reddit, and that many people will see that as a bad thing, but i'll do anything to prove that i'm real.  My husband and I just got a divorce. My daughter and I moved into our own apartment, and I am trying to get back on my feet. I am in the midst of getting things in order with Job and Family Services, but until then i'm broke.  So, if anyone can help, that would be great! When I get back on my feet, I will surely pay it forward.

t3_jct44	1312838848.0	hailmary123	shroom	(Request) Hungry Movie Night	Tonight is the first movie night since we moved into a home (not funded by the government) & one of the last mondays my children have of summer vacation. I would love for my family to bond over pizza. However now I have more bills to pay and ordering food is not in the budget. This would really bring up my teens hope & motivate them to do well in school. (being that they are easily food-motivated). They are very bright and deserve the world, but being that the world is not up for grabs, hopefully pizza is. A family that eats together sleeps together... with a full tummy :D

t3_jcjr3	1312822460.0	Jabem		Poll for how I give out pizzas	Hey guys, I've done 2 posts over the last 2 weeks offering pizza to whoever can guess my number. First was between 1-1337. I realize this was WAY to big and my second attempt was from 1-666. now I realize this is pretty big too, but that thread saw 177 comments, so I'm asking you this, would you rather me put the same chance up for many weeks to come, or would you rather me make the number smaller, make sure someone wins and probably be done posting random pizzas quicker? It's up to you guys, I'm fine either way and hopeing to have someone win a pizza one week. btw, last time someone was 1 number away from the correct one and I was pretty excited, but it never got picked =/

t3_jcgk9	1312816815.0	maireilla		Dominos is having a contest on their FB page, and they are offering a $10 gift card every 60 seconds! I tried it, and I won, so details within. (Only in US, have to be 18 or older on your FB)	Hey everyone! In order to win in the contest,  you have to go to Dominos FB page, 'Like' it, add their app, and then get the highscore in a pizza-arcade-shooting game with Noid. It's not too hard, while I was playing the highscore was usually around 300,000.  The trick is, shoot the pizzas/tomatoes as fast as possible, because they are worth more. Don't hit anything with the Noid face on it, or Noid himself, or not a tomato or pizza. I'm not sure if there was a bonus for hitting pizzas so many times in a row. You have a 'Bomb' meter in the upper right, fill and use it as much as possible. The games are short, the maximum amount of times you can use the Bomb meter is about 3. Hit all the tomatoes too, if you don't, you lose points. Practice makes perfect! Also, you may have to refresh the page after the first game, sometimes it had a game running behind the waiting screen, and it wouldn't count your score if that happened. You can tell by the music.  It took me about 5-10 minutes to finally win. I had to give them my email, and they sent the giftcard code and pin to my email within a few minutes. It's only $10, only works on their website for ordering. No expiration date. Also, only in the US, and you have to be 18 or older to play. We tried with my little brother (14) and no can do.  Just thought I would let everyone know!  ***It's back!!! :)***	True

t3_jc21j	1312774243.0	Gothbot6k	shroom	Random acts of pizza I would like to explain my last 12 months in hopes of getting a pizza.	Ok RaP.  Let me tell you about myself: Im Male and Im 18 (as of a week ago.) I live with my mom and a roommate My mom is divorced twice. Im basically a 3rd parent to my baby brother. My mom won't let me grow up.  I am an ent and thats how I make it through every day/week/month (I just started this year.) I have diagnosed seasonal depression.insomnia and anxiety. Which I should be seen for but lack of money prevents that. Im a gamer. I havent talked to my father /step mother in 2 years because they made me suicidal and stole $500 from me (save up allowance money over the years)      Heres the last 12-14 months of my life. (this is more of a rant) My stepdad left my mom who makes less then a school teacher and is a  mother of two. My mom wasn't able to file for child support for 4 months after this. So we had to survive on our own since my stepdad did everything he could do not to pay child support. And he didn't for 4 months. Last summer I was allowed to get my first job (my mother is controlling and doesn't want me to grow up) And at the beginning of it my mom told I could keep every penny for me. However all the money went to food/bills. My bonds I had had since I was born were ready to be cashed so they were. $800 and never saw a penny.  I also had to quit wow :(   My mom gets a really nice laptop from work (maxed out macbook pro) that was meant for work but it was her replacement instead of raise. My stepfather takes care of all the Macs in the city that we live and he had to make sure that it got taken away from her. And he did. Now she uses my computer and I don't really get to use my computer till now.  I had to quit my job :(  My mother is constantly under stress and has a heart condition so during my time of major depression Im also under constant stress and have panic attacks everyday. I also develop insomnia and get about 2-3 hours of sleep every night during the begging-middle of a school year.  At about december my step father stole my mothers identity and charged over $300 to a gay porn site. He did this twice the second time way in may for the same reason. He also ran up $40000 worth of credit card bills while married and will finally be payed off after 8 of waiting next year. He also isn't taking responsibility of that.  My grandmother fell and got pneumonia. She also had polio as a child and only has one lung. She now lives permanently in an ICU and can never walk/e/talk again because of a traych. ( I can't spell) This wouldn't bother me so bad except my mother keeps bring up that she will never be able to say I love you again. She's also basically a vegetable and doesn't want to be like this but my grandfather is in denial and won't let go. He is also having panic/heart attacks so he won't visit because they cause him and my mother is torn up over this and thinks as soon as her mother goes her father will go. And because of the empathy its killing me as well.  About a few months ago my stepdad started to brain wash my baby brother so that he wouldn't want to visit my mom anymore and he could stop paying child support.  Now we come to this point. Most of this is still going on however with my stepdad gone we had to get a roommate. (an high school sweet heart of my mom) and he's paying for some things. But over the past year Ive had to be the man of the house since my stepdad was gone. My mom was so depressed for the first 3 months that I had to be the parent to my little brother. So now I watch him and IM a 3rd parent at the age of 18 now. Because of my stepdad he freaks out whenever he's alone by himself so he is really clingy and has issues with leaving (because of his dad walking out (my stepdad)) So alongside of being the parental figure in his life I have to manage the house and other things. And you know what it just sucks.  Recently (1 month ago)  my step father got me a used macbook from a family friend. Well since my moms was taken away because of him and was using my computer (desktop) she immediately decreed it to be hers. And that really pisses me off because for the last 8 years of my life Ive been asking for a laptop. And I finally get a good one (close to as good as my desktop) and she takes it from me. In the past 2 days she has used it more then Ive held it.  And it really sucks because I was going to use it for college next year but I guess Ill have to find $1000 to get another that is if I can even get money for college. And what really brings me to a fury is that this is her 6th laptop in 4 years… All of which were given to her.   So today specifically:I was woken up 5 hours before I wake up (Ive been getting up at 3 pm lately) I was told to go do ALL THE YARD WORK. So I did over the course of 6 hours. I hate yard work more then anything.But I put up with it. I come inside after a long day of work… She had been using the laptop to get on Facebook while she watched movies with my brother ON MY BED IN MY ROOM USING MY THINGS DIDNT ASK OR ANYTHING. She then proceeds to throw a bitch fit because I ask if I can use the laptop for 10 mins and she could use the desktop not 3 feet away from her. This put me over the edge I kicked everyone out (mom took the laptop) and Ive been trying to cool down ever since. Not 15 minutes later she threw my brother on my for 4 hours of baby sitting. Now I love my brother and mother but I honestly get sick and tired of everything. I used to be a person I used to have a life and do things. I was a teenager living the life!But now I don't get to have a life till my brother goes to bed at 9:30. And at that point its 30 mins till I crash. I try to be a good person. I recycle, Im vegetarian.  I generally do good things but honestly life sucks. Especially when it hits you head on. Now to talk about food. For the past year Ive been having to eat food that is walmart brand and kroger brand which is all fine and good but I would love some pizza. I haven't had a slice of pizza in over a year. Ive had to skip out of eating lunch because we can't afford it. And we can't afford a pizza often so we haven't done it since my stepdad was here. Tommorow August 8th 2011. It would be really awesome if at 5 pm someone could have a papa johns pizza delivered. Specifics: Large Cheese Pizza (I will make this last at least 4 meals) Cheese sticks 2 liter (this will last me a week) A cinnapie would be cool but not needed.  Tl:DR Shitty year could really use a slice of better life.  PM me if your serious and want to know info.   *edit* I received money for the pizza. The user would like to remain anonymous but thank you very much. Your an incredible human being. I thank you for making my life easy in a difficult time. :)	True

Can't wait to do this for someone else as soon as I can!     Cecil County, MD here!  I see a lot of sob stories on here. Hey, I'm no different. It's tough times out there. I don't get to go grocery shopping until Monday, so there's not a lot of food in the house. My 2-year-old twins have dinner in their bellies (I try and make sure there is ALWAYS food for them), but I do not. I have two options...   Option 1: Eat Shrimp flavored Ramen noodles. Not bad by any means, but I've had it for lunch and dinner for three days now. I wish I had bought some different flavors now.   Option 2: One of you kind hearted Redditors will take pity on my Ramen overdose and spring for Pizza Hut or Dominos!  It's just me, so even a small or medium pizza is fine. I'm a cheap date. Just please save me from the ramen tonight.  As soon as I can, I will pay this forward!	True

t3_jacj1	1312587856.0	afshin	pizza-gold	It just occurred to me...	I've sent out a few pizzas to places near and far in the last few weeks, but it just occurred to me that I haven't actually *eaten* any pizza in months!  See, I used to live in New York City, and I was lucky enough to have lunches like these frequently: [om](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3299/4625294872_0e16feeecd_z.jpg) [nom](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3160/4561888313_ef18972759_z.jpg) [nom](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3510/4561887557_1dcc469972_z.jpg) [om](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2683/4517947629_7533fa8ccf_z.jpg) [nom](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4518582224_7bb92acf21_z.jpg) [nom](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4518582158_fa5be9f207_z.jpg)  But since I've left NYC, other pizzas just don't taste *right* to me.  Oh well, it's still made me happy to spread some pizza love even if I'm not partaking in any myself.

t3_ja75t	1312576095.0	smeddie		Lost job, can't get one, waiting for welfare.  hungry.	So the short version of my life is that I've been living alone for 7 years(I'm 23) and never got much from my parents(they were physically abusive).  I ended up going to college as an "adult student" but couldn't finish it as I ended up being too hungry to not work a full time job(I see a lot of people do this but I just couldn't keep up :().  As of now I have about $6, nobody to help support me, I'm waiting for welfare, and can't seem to get a job due to my criminal record.  The short story on the criminal record is someone stole something of my girlfriend at the times and when I asked for it back started a fight with me.  He was much bigger than me and had a lot of friends that began attacking me and I hit him with a beer bottle and was consequently charged.  I've tried lying about it, asking why the didn't hire me(they openly said that was the reason why), and being open about it.  No dice.  I lost my previous job due to a personal issue with myself and 2 other members of my team but had worked there diligently for 2 years.  I've spent all of my other money on dog food(dog first) and what little food I could grab(ramen, plain noodles and pasta sauce).  I'm confident that I'll be able to borrow some money from a friend within the next few days but am sick of eating this brick of cheese all day long.  If anyone could help I'd much appreciate it.    I also play LoL and some other games if anyone ever wants to hop on my vent server and play!  Thanks for everyones time and please dont prioritize me over people with children etc.  tl;dr regular guy can't get job due to stupid mistake of a bar fight and is currently eating a brick of cheese over the course of today until he can borrow money.    OH, almost forgot!  I'm allergic to eggs so can only eat from certain pizza places if anyone is willing to help.  It's a pain in the ass so I apologize if there's any trouble that way!

t3_j9h5o	1312512542.0	isspecialist	FAP	Thank you SO much to Misteral!	Girlfriend was very surprised when I called her and told her I'd be bringing home pizza for supper.  She's a redditor too, so I imagine she'll drop in to say thanks tomorrow (she's in bed now).  We'll fight over who gets to take the last 2 pieces to work then too.  :-)  We made a thank you on the pizza box and the youngest wanted to get in the [picture](http://i.imgur.com/O9qzH.jpg).   She told me to "tell him what the picture is" too, so here goes.   First she drew a heart.  Then she put a happy face on it.  Then she decided that the heart should have arms and legs.  Then it needed hair.  But not just any hair; it needed "super long hair, all the way to the ground".     She then said "It's walking on his hair."  She asked me to print that underneath, but when I did she told me it was wrong.  "Daddy it's a girl.  It's a SHE, not a HE."  I pointed out that she said "his hair" but logic is lost on a 5 year old.  She added the "S".   Hopefully I can pay it forward before long.  Thank you again.  :-D

Just to keep this subreddit going strong :)  No, I won't need your address, name, faceboko, photo or whatever. If you want to eat a pizza but can't afford to buy it, or heck, you could just use the equivalent money of a pizza on bills or whatever, post here!  Unfortunately living in Australia I can't buy giftcards for anyone in the US. I've tried and tried and tried with different methods but the giftcard websites outright refuse to let an aussiebuy a Pizza for Americans.  If you live in the UK or Australia though I should be able to manage to giftcard you (but again, only if that is what you prefer!)  I might ask for some proof if your account is like 2 hours old or something (probably verification code), only to make sure you're not that particular unpleasant individual who ruined everyones day!  Another idea: If your'e having trouble transferring the money i sent you from yoru paypal to your bank account try and find someone (who is a registered giver preferably) to buy you the giftcard and accept payment via paypal!  edit: also how much would a large pizza cost with delivery and what you americans call a tip?   **edit 2:** holy crap the response has been HUGE, you guys are all great! I've gone well over my 6 pizza quota I set for myself. But whatever, keep asking away! I might tally up the results in the end and see how much pizza was sent :D	True
t3_j9d39	1312503769.0	capitalb620	FAP	So we really have to watch out for people seeming to offer now? 	Earlier a user named "jadams1234" made a post saying her SO was in Afghanistan and was interested in gifting pizzas to few folks who had military ties. A lot of people responded and were told to send their code and address to this person. About 5 minutes ago, the OP was editied bragging about all of the mailing addresses they had received and were giving to a database, as well as some pretty harsh language. That's really damn low, and I'm sure left a few people who were promised pizzas (myself included) searching for dinner now. Hopefully this doesnt become a new trend.

t3_j8c5e	1312421106.0	DEStudent	PIF	THANK YOU FOR IFTAR!	I just wanted to thank PakistaniMuslim for his or her kindness and generosity in donating Iftar to Fasting Muslims. It really means a lot after fasting 12+ hours  to have a nice meal  THANK YOU AND I like your idea: Random_Iftars!  Also as a side note: Iftar (Arabic: إفطار‎), refers to the evening meal when Muslims break their fast during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Iftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their fast together. Iftar is done right after Maghrib (sunset) time. Traditionally, a date is the first thing to be consumed when the fast is broken.   Ramadan (Turkish:Ramazan) (Arabic: رمضان‎ Ramaḍān, Arabic pronunciation: [rɑmɑˈdˤɑːn]) is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, which lasts 29 or 30 days. It is the Islamic month of fasting, in which participating Muslims refrain from eating, drinking and intimacy with their partners[1] during daylight hours and is intended to teach Muslims about patience, spirituality, humility and submissiveness to God. Muslims fast for the sake of God (Arabic: الله‎, trans: Allah) and to offer more prayer than usual. Compared to the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan vary, moving backwards by about eleven days each year depending on the moon; thus, a person will have fasted every day of the calendar year in 34 years' time. Muslims believe Ramadan to be an auspicious month for the revelations of God to humankind, being the month in which the first verses of the Qur'an were revealed to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.  While I know there are some on this site that may be agnostic, Christian, Jewish, Atheist or any other belief, I can honestly say this was a pleasant surprise. This was not about excluding anyone from getting pizza, this was something our brother or sister did as charity and a kindness.   If you have any further questions about Islam, or Muslims or what we believe, please feel free to ask. (NO TROLLS OR YOU WILL BE REPORTED)	True

I am out of work and freelancing, I wont get paid for another week at least. A pizza would be my first meal in 2 days, I have been sufficing myself on 25c bags of chips and water.   Well the chips are done, and I hope you can help.  I am the type who generally helps others, and will certainly pay this forward.  Thanks everyone.

I do however have a question.  What in the world are all the various taggy things? I know the slice of pizza and the mushroom... but there is an FSM and a cheerleader and a differently colored pizza... If someone has a legend of meanings somewhere that would be great!   Thanks!	
t3_j81bk	1312400166.0	Advent667	shroom	You all are amazing	The simple fact that a subreddit like this even exists is the very reason I even frequent reddit. Just a simple, random act of awesomness can make someones week. I love you all that put forth the effort.  now give yourselves a pat on the back <3

Thank You    Chris	
t3_j7to9	1312386874.0	Waffleboy		Really could use a RAOP....	Hey Reddit, I could really use a random act of pizza about now.  My family keeps spending my money on frivolities that I can't afford, so I have a crushing debt I can't hope to pay back and now my bank is saying if I keep missing payments, my credit score will go down (which of course will make things worse).  My job is also killing me right now.  I'm working 60-80 hour work weeks and my bosses are saying if I don't keep performing, I will lose my job within a year or so.  But most of what I'm doing these days is trying to control my coworkers and act as a mediator between some of the insane things they are doing.  I have two young daughters who are upset about everything, and I really don't have the time or money to get them a pizza.  I'm not asking for me (I'll be at work), I'm asking for them.  If you live in the DC area, could you please send a pizza to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?  I will be forever grateful and hopefully can return the favor when things are looking up for me.  Thanks so much.  -BHO

t3_j7naj	1312371728.0	snang	SM	Just something I'd like to get off my chest.	I've seen some rather bothersome posts and comments lately.  People complaining about not getting pizza.  How they have 821 kids, 4 husbands, 7 dogs and no electricity.  People act as if this subreddit is here for the sole purpose of feeding the less fortunate.  While that does happen and I support it 100%, it's ultimately not why we're here.  This is RANDOM Acts of Pizza.  If I want to send someone on a scavenger hunt for the most random shit I can think of in exchange for a pizza, so be it.  If I want to give pizza to someone who drives a green Ford Taurus, so be it.  Give a pizza to the person who guesses closest to my number from 1 to 82,242,102.  It's my choice, I'm the person spending my hard earned money on you.  This subreddit isn't a food bank, soup kitchen, or pizza buffet.  We're here to randomly brighten someones day with some greasy goodness, regardless of the terms (within reason).  I'm not trying to be a dick, but this needed to be said.  I hate reading sob stories all day.  Let's see some fun posts.  If you're starving and need food, do what the giver asks of you.  You might...RANDOMLY...be gifted a pizza.  Crazy idea eh?  Let's try and lighten the mood here.  **It's supposed to be fun.**  <3

t3_j7udq	1312388176.0	GlitterPrincess		"Random" you say?	So, I just found this subreddit and had to check it out. I have 2 questions: 1. Who picks the toppings??? and 2. If you order a pizza from someone with your credit card, and they tip the driver, who decides the amount?  I will be spending the day in the pool, on vacation from work, cooler full of booze, and enjoying life. If some random redditor would like to send me a pizza, I'd certainly eat it. Especially if there was bacon on it. 	
t3_j7stu	1312385277.0	realcoldice		\m/ \m/ Vegan Pizza?	Does Random_Acts_Of_Pizza include us lowly poor peons who eat vegan? Cause I'd sure love a Mount Veggiemore from Mountain Mike's with no cheese. I'll even share little pieces of the soft white freshly baked dough inside the crusts with my cat Simon. (He likes the fresh white breads and yes of course I also feed him regular meat cat food, that little beast)  	
t3_j7spk	1312385048.0	MiddleSidePunk		(request) Panhandle Pizza Craving	No sob story here. Just a little tight on cash until next Friday, and do not want to eat Ramen everyday until then. I make decent money for my age, but have to pay off college loans and other living expenses. I took some time off to do family stuff for the 4th of July and just didn't pull in the kind of money I'm used to these past pay checks. I'll be back to normal next Friday, but was just hoping I could have the indulgence of having a pizza before then. Hopefully I can repay the favor to another fellow redditor in need of some delicious cheesy goodness once I get my next pay check :)  (Northwest Florida Panhandle) if that needs to be clarified.

Last night I received [this!](http://i.imgur.com/Oknc7.jpg) a wonderful thick crust cheddar only pizza from dominos with Italian sausage, jalapeno peppers, diced tomatos, onions, and mushrooms.  (seen here taking two homebrew to the ball)  It was a surprise for [this girl](http://i.imgur.com/7QtUK.jpg) seen here lunging gluttonously for the pizza.  She was ecstatic and so grateful! (she is lactose intolerant which is why I asked for an all chedder pizza, Chadnickbok obliged!)  Over the next 20 minutes we did [this alot](http://i.imgur.com/KfAfO.jpg)  And suddenly it looked alot more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/bNWuj.jpg).  I was so full, satisfied, and happy that I fell asleep less than 15 minutes after eating, while watching shark week.  Hence why I didn't post this all last night.  I am so grateful to Chadnickbok for this selfless act, and to RAOP for inspiring this generosity in people.  I look forward to being able to pay it back.  PS.  I made sure to tip the very courteous delivery man generously.  This should be a tradition in RAOP if it isn't already.	True

I, Tyler, lost my job ironically, delivering pizza, I lost my job due to repeated abuse from my manager, and this is a small pizza chain, so a driver has no rights.

t3_j725k	1312318748.0	icantreyd		a meal for a smile	Hey guys, I don't really know what to say here as I'm not your archetypal groveler. Though unfortunately, like many a soul I have come across here, I have been severely down on my luck as of late. I live in a charity run hostel, so as you can imagine, money/conditions aren't too spectacular to begin with- this, I can bare. However, this week just as many weeks, I have found myself in a predicament where I am penniless and void of electricity to cook even if i did have the food. Living here is a lonely sort of life, so situations like this can't help but get you down, this coalesced with the passing of my nan and awaiting her funeral next week have ultimately left a rather sizable dark cloud hanging above my head. I'm a simple sort of guy, who can appreciate a kind gesture, and with a warm meal and a full belly could surely have his spirits lifted. I live in the UK so I am unsure as to how many people could help- but really, even knowing somebody with such kindness is out there makes a difference.

t3_j6glw	1312265633.0	MotivatedJohn		Repost:  Looking for a little boost 	This summer has been particularly rough for me. I got a ticket for giving an officer a false name and it has drained almost every dollar I have. I spend basically all my excess money on my little brother who lives with my alcoholic mom because I want him to be happy more than I want me to be happy. I have been eating salami and mustard sandwiches for a couple of weeks now and I just cant stand it anymore. My budget at this point doesnt allow me to just order a pizza, but if someone out there is kind enough to order one for me... I , and my stomach, would really appreciate it. I have been reading a lot about scammers and fake people on this site lately, I will gladly send you any request of proof. Thank you so much reddit! I will return the favor one day!!  Was told by a friendly redditor to repost so people would see im still out here.  Hope you are all doing well... say hello if ya wanna chat :)

t3_j6ddr	1312257980.0	CountingBlessings	FAP	Just an opinion and a request...not for pizza but for others!! 	I requested pizza and didn't receive because I dont have a camera to take pix of my children to put on here, its fairly new computer that was given to me to finish college online. I had proof of everything else but I honestly don't understand that. I thought this was about helping people. I understand scammers and what not but if they can prove other facts that helps their story then why doubt them. This isnt to bash on anyone or anything just a thought. I help run a food bank in my community we dont ask for proof of what your app says. We just simply ask for household size, names and dob. no bc or ssn nor do we require to see the children. yes im sure there are people that lie on the app but what goes around comes around and one day they will learn their lesson...thats not in our hands( we dont like doubting people). I just enjoy helping. The one time I ask for some help, I cant get it because I dont have a camera to take a photo of the children in my home...wanna call and talk to them?? Anyhow sorry for babbling just thought it was a lil messed up and discouraging!! Just do me a favor when your all gitty and ready to give to someone...take into consideration that people are here for the most part for help and if that is the case maybe they dont have things that you require! Thank you for ur time!

t3_j69cl	1312249594.0	mealasvegas	pizza	Random acts of pizza in real life? And feeling pretty damn good about it.	Okay, so, I put a request in a few days ago. Single mom yadda yadda yadda.  So anyway, I work at a motel, and every time there is a delivery to our motel from Papa John's, they will sign a little piece of paper with the pizza box sticker sticker and a signature on it - once we reach 10, we get a free pizza. Each desk clerk has their own signature sheet.  So anyway, I had been saving up for a few months, because I only work a few days every few weeks [my mom is the manager and I get called in when I am needed]. Honestly, I usually sit at the bottom of the stairs when I see the Papa John's guy on the camera with my paper and a pen because sometimes [ie. most of the time] they'll leave without signing/giving the sticker because then they get to save them and use them basically like cash around the motels. So anyway, dedication went into saving up for this free pizza.   Finally, I got it. I had worked SO HARD for this and I finally got it.   Until last night. Last night, at work, a woman had come in, she was adorable with an ADORABLE daughter, who decided to tell me about why she was at the motel. She had 80 dollars to her name and was trying to escape her abusive husband, and didn't have enough money to feed her child. A room at the motel is normally 59.95+ tax [67.75 all together] and I gave her the room for 35.95 all together.  I mentioned this in my last post, but I'm a single mom in college, and I'm pretty broke as well, but you know what? This lady needed a free fucking pizza. And some drinks. And breadsticks. And I do not think I've ever felt better in my life for doing something for another person.  I thought you guys would appreciate this story. :)  TL;DR - Saved up like a monster to get a free pizza from Papa John's and ended up giving it to a person who needed it a lot more than I did.

We were having trouble keeping track of the requests on here and didn't want to miss anyone. When people submit request through the ap it shoots us an email and then publishes the request under "pizza stories." From there it can be filled by us or anyone else.   Would the moderators be willing to direct folks looking for pizzas in Austin to: http://preview.tinyurl.com/42zf8ca  ?

Now I am on the East coast and there aren't any JITB locations around here. I'd like to give it to someone who might be going through a rough patch and could use a free meal. It is valid through Dec 31, 2011.  If you're down on your luck and would like it, please PM me with your address and I will mail it to you ASAP.	
t3_j4cz1	1312060050.0	pseudorealism	shroom	So this is an official thankyou thread, because paulinator is totally rad.	User [Paulinator](http://www.reddit.com/user/paulinator) most graciously responded to my post. He/She sent me some awesome pizza money, and I bought my mom a pizza and she was able to relax after a hard day of work and enjoy the generosity of others (when she is so generous herself). If she knew how to work reddit, she'd be saying thanks as well haha. I guess [this picture right here](http://i.imgur.com/eX4jd.jpg) will do.  But I had some more money left over, and to be honest, I thought about buying myself a pizza. But I thought against that, because I was sure there were better ways to spend that money. So I bought a pizza for my friends who go to school like 8 hours a day, I figured a sweet pizza would be a good idea.  Here's their thanks in the [awesome](http://i.imgur.com/yXZNp.jpg) form of [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/Q0FBM.jpg). I know that trolls and people who take advantage of this subreddit have been a serious issue and topic of conversation here, so take comfort in the fact that this subreddit helped make the day of several people. Not to mention they **totally** didn't see it coming, so the RANDOM part of random acts of pizza was completely upheld. Cheers, guys, thanks for helping out. And thanks again to Paulinator!	True

Last a good old cheese pizza medium crust.  5.

I was supposed to have a potluck with my parent's and my twin sister's family. It's now 5:30 and my sister has decided to go out to eat with her fam instead and I just can't afford where she want's to go. She's not one for compromise. they have waaaay more monry than us and just can't seem to understand why everyone can't just do what they want all the time. And now my mom just called to say her and my dad would rather just go out for ice cream tomorrow evening, but I can't because I am on clean-up for my church's VBS night. They always pull some kind of selfish crap on my birthday every year....especially if it falls on a weekend. It's getting old. My husband and the kids just ran out for a cake so we can sing later, so that's cool. It's just getting late and I am a little bummed about going thru the same crap all the time with my family...I am always saying "yes" to everything they need and just wish for once they would just come through or not have a song and a dance about why they suddenly can't do something. I would love to not have to cook tonight. It would make me completely happy, giddy even. I received pizza once before. I wish I could just say I'll pay it forward next week, but we are just not in that financial position. Not yet...It won't be until September that I can pay pizza forward. But, i do like it here and try to help where i can. I will even send you some killer homemade choc. chip cookies :o) Seriously, I will. I will survive if no one wants to help. It's no emergency or anything. I'll just yank out the Manwich or fishsticks and get cookin, LOL... It's just a want to brighten my crappy evening. We are 2 adults...well maybe 3 since my son is 16 and 2 kids...We have Pizza Hut and Dominos here...Anything would make me happy.

t3_j4b0y	1312054802.0	Evanakin88		Need help giving thanks, I am trying one last time for the weekend.	Here's the story- So my family decides they want to move but my parent's are getting up there in age and they had a house full of stuff so being the good son I am, I offer to help.  Well the problem was that there were quite a few things in the house one person couldn't get by himself, in some cases it took three grown men to move certain things, (like an old big screen TV out of the basement) anyway I needed to get a few friends together to help me get things going. Another issue I ran into was finding people, for some reason it's pretty hard to get folks to do something for nothing, and more than a few "friends" turned me away.  So here is what I want to do, I want to get the people who did help, (two other guys), something for their time and effort but I myself am flat broke, so here goes... can someone help me say 'thank you' to a couple of good Samaritans who thought they would be helping me for nothing. Any help is greatly appreciated. The main reason I ask is because I have had some luck here before and thought that I might be able to find another generous soul.  TL;DR: I need some pie to say thank you to some guys who really deserve it.  Edit : I live in the Jacksonville, Alabama area small college town lots of Za places nearby.

t3_j4970	1312049732.0	jayda3071	shroom	REQUEST (IN) Depressed and overwhelmed, needing a pizza break for awhile, and some prayers too.	Been having problems with severe depression, but I just started treatment yesterday. I know I'll be on the mend very soon, for my daughter's sake.  Just been having a rough time with life and feeling overwhelmed with all the financial and health problems lately, just got stacked on one after the other and I felt suffocated by it.  Im not going to post a long sob story about me being a single parent (But truth be known I am a single parent, and my 10 year old daughter is my world) Feel free to ask questions if you need to.   I know a pizza wont magically make my problems disappear, but for now, Id really like to treat her and myself just to some mom and daughter time. My funds are limited, I can show my bank book ledger with my current balance if that would help prove anything.  I can show proof of my therapy appointments, or proof why Im in treatment, but Ill be honest I dont have a camera anymore, but I DO have a scanner.  We dont have a Dominos in our area, Pizza Hut is just down the street, and Papa Johns is about 15mi away but Im not picky.  Any pizza help at all would be helpful.  In the meantime while I wait, I wrote this poem. Enjoy.  Praying for Pizza! A juicy pizza the object of my desires You tease me with your cheesy goodness, and for that Id walk a mile! Its been a rough week, Ive been down on my luck My bank account shows too little...not even a buck. What Id enjoy now is a round two-topping dream The heck with spending the day eating chips and ice cream I need something scrumptious, as my mind is a mess If just for a short while, with a full stomach I can rest So Im praying for pizza, no matter what size Pepperoni, sausage.....what a wonder for my eyes! So please Reddit Random Acts of Pizza don't let me down I promise to return the favor the next time around. And give someone else a pizza out of the kindness of my heart For now a pizza would give this weekend a much happier start!

Anyway, my mother, who's one of the hardest working people I know, has done nothing but drive for the past two days. She's driven from Northern Indiana to Alabama and back to pick up my sisters, and she really does not feel like cooking. I don't blame her. We have food possibilities, and as such, I totally understand if we don't get anything, but it'd be really nice if we could get a pizza, because we aren't exactly financially blessed.

t3_j3kyi	1311973300.0	CuzinVinny		R.A.O.P, is there such a thing as R.A.O.C.F?	CHINESE FOOD!  I heard about another subreddit opening its doors, exclusively [MeetAndEat](http://www.reddit.com/r/MeetandEat/). I was just wondering, is there a sub/r for Chinese food?  Random_Acts_of_Pizza could be the inspiration needed for Random_Acts_of_Chinese_Food  I mean, when we think of delivery, we all think of either Pizza or Chinese food. So why not have both in sub/r's?  I would love to make this a reality, and would need quite a couple of Mods and such to help out. I know Kritiekitty(SP?) is one of the most active people on this site, and I would be honored if she would be a mod (if this subreddit comes true)  What would the pros/cons be for such a sub/r? Would it be harder to buy Chinese food rather then pizza? I dont want to seem like its a better alternative, but not as a lame proposal either. Instead of spending 25$ on a gift card, people could just spend around 15$ for a delivery, which could easily by enough food for a family of 4. My local chinese restaurant offers a huge special for 7.50$, it comes with a huge platter of food, a side of rice and 2 egg rolls.   I need your thoughts R.A.O.P! If we want to truly help in the world, I think multiple sub/r's with a multitude of flexibility to help one another would be going in the right direction.  Thoughts? (Mods, I would really like to know your opinions as well, please :D)

You get one point for every $5 you spend and 25 points = a large 3 topping pizza.  To sign up you just go to your account and enroll.

I thought it would be a great idea and i planned to move out of their house also once i saved up enough money to..  Well this house is filthy as fuck..we have about 20 sickly cats who piss and shit everywhere! so i can't prepare food in the kitchen even if we had any an the account of the cat piss all over everything.  I'm sure it sounds strange that i wouldn't just clean the kitchen myself and prepare food after wards however consider this..our kitchen floor is brown..BROWN I tell you and it was once white according to my boyfriend..not to mention we have tons of food!! more than anyone one would ever need but i have no idea how old it is because his grandmother is a hoarder..i am not allowed to throw out any food what so ever no matter if it expired in 2006, has mold or what have you. Our fridge is also covered in grime..and i can't clean that because it would involve taking things out of the fridge and GOD FORBID! To better explain her pack rat tendencies there is a whole bedroom devoted to things she can't throw away..and attic..and basement so much so that my boyfriends mother had to move down into a tiny room in the basement instead of her bedroom, because it was taken over by sentimental things his grandmother couldn't get rid of. So I've been living off the canned food we have in an old cupboard knowing it can't really expire and that it can't be exposed to cat piss..and yes his grandmother does not clean frying pans once cats have pissed in them..she still cooks in it..so i can't eat the meals she prepares because i'm terrified..  sorry about the wall of text but when i came across this i just exploded.

We were hit with some unexpected bills this month so any help that could be given would be greatly appreciated so our money can take care of these bills (medical, school coming up(although I guess this is expected), car problems, you know the unexpected stuff).  Although I will admit that my kids will not go hungry, it may just mean they are eating ramen noodles for a few meals, so having a pizza would make their day.  Thanks and have a great day.  Also, I have no idea if I am doing this right.....I am not very computer savy so please forgive me :)	True

However, I would at some point like to help. I looked at Domino's and Pizza Hut's sites but they don't seem to give nationwide prices and I'm guessing they can't fluctuate that much state to state.

t3_j2pb2	1311897460.0	Evanakin88		(Request) I need help giving thanks, I am trying one more time...	Here's the story- So my family decides they want to move but my parent's are getting up there in age and they had a house full of stuff so being the good son I am, I offer to help.  Well the problem was that there were quite a few things in the house one person couldn't get by himself, in some cases it took three grown men to move certain things, (like an old big screen TV out of the basement) anyway I needed to get a few friends together to help me get things going. Another issue I ran into was finding people, for some reason it's pretty hard to get folks to do something for nothing, and more than a few "friends" turned me away.  So here is what I want to do, I want to get the people who did help, (two other guys), something for their time and effort but I myself am flat broke, so here goes... can someone help me say 'thank you' to a couple of good Samaritans who thought they would be helping me for nothing. Any help is greatly appreciated. The main reason I ask is because I have had some luck here before and thought that I might be able to find another generous soul.  TL;DR: I need some pie to say thank you to some guys who really deserve it.  Edit : I live in the Jacksonville, Alabama area small college town lots of Za places nearby.

t3_j2nbu	1311893205.0	StartingOverFresh		First time requesting - throwaway acct	Wife & I are splitting up for good, she has gone for the weekend to spend time with some of her family for a bit.  Using a throwaway because we haven't notified most of our friends & family yet of our situation, and I know a few people know my primary reedit account.  It's an amicable split, but that doesn't make it instantly easy, either.  That all being said, it's not only rough emotionally, but selling a house is rough (especially with the nature of the economy and us not being at a point where we were expecting to sell).  I could probably spare the $10 for a small or medium pizza, but I'm *really* trying to save every penny to help with all the costs.  Plus, right now, a lot of things just feel like it sucks.  A little more right now since I'm in this house by myself.  If anyone thinks I'm a troll/scammer, I'd be happy to give you the name of my primary reddit name in private and verify through there and/or through the verification system.  FYI, I'm in the U.S., if that matters to anyone.  Thanks, guys and gals.	True

t3_j2lcx	1311889436.0	AngelLass		Moving bites	Not only am I moving at work- which includes moving solid oak desks for a boss who pays me a measly 7.25 an hour, but I'm currently moving into a cheaper apartment for 600 a month plus utilities... Moving bites. No way around it. You pack it, haul it, unpack and unpack it.... Ugh. And of course, the moving job for my boss is only part time, so I'm not making nearly enough money to actually FEED myself. Hell, I can't even afford body soap- I had to ask for some at the hotel down the street. >.< Oh, how I would kill for a slice of pizza...  How do people live like this?! I applied for food stamps and was told online that I qualify but it looks like I have a couple of weeks until they kick in. Till then, looks like I'll be living off of white rice and tuna cans. But, so is life! I'll get through this once I get my AA at the end of the fall semester.... Then hopefully I can get a half way decent job! :( Wish me luck guys.

We were not in great financial standing to begin with, but I have done everything I could over the last few months to buy things to have us ready for the baby, and everything is doing great there.  However, wifey is already starting to feel the post-partum depression setting in.  She feels like we will never be able to enjoy life again because money is a little tight right now.

t3_j27hz	1311864342.0	synesthesiatic		Could use a bit of cheering up.	The tl;dr of it is, I took a job with a company overseas for illustration work and got scammed for it.

t3_j247q	1311856201.0	Stuff1234		Some thoughts by a regular	This is a near-throwaway account (1 other post) because it's important to me to retain my anonymity as much as possible. I'm a regular denizen over at /r/Assistance, and signed on to RAOP when they started it up some 6 or 7 months ago as I recall. I have been a regular contributor of pizzas here (about $1,140 worth, according to my receipts), which I try to give anonymously when possible. Recently, I've hit some financial snags which have forced me to back off (for just a while, hopefully), but I expect to return to pizza-donating when my life gets regularized again. I say all this (on my throwaway account) just to give some background so that people can evaluate my comments and accept or toss them as they wish.  1) RAOP has: some people who give regularly; some people who give occasionally; some people who have given once or twice, as they have been able to afford it; and some people who would like to give, but cannot afford it.  2) RAOP has: some people who are in need and are asking for help, even though it hurts their pride; some people who aren't in desperate straits but are hoping for some comfort food instead of their regular boring necessarily restricted menu; some people who think "what the heck" and give it a try and are just amazed that there are people out there still who give a hoot enough about strangers to buy them a pizza.  3) RAOP has: some trolls who are bored and like to cause problems, the Internet equivalent of taggers and vandals; some poseur-vigilantes who get their kicks by imposing their judgments in a public forum.  The publicity we got here most definitely caused an increase in #3, but also in #'s 1 and 2. So be it. (Though in the future, my personal preference would be to politely decline any interviews/offers for more publicity by the mainstream media).  The removal of the downvote was a classically liberal attempt to soften the pride-injury of having to ask for help. (I say "liberal" in the academic sociological sense, and am not making a value-judgment about it. Recent conservative thought has usurped the word "liberal" and turned it into a dirty word in popular discourse, but among classic academics it retains its original meaning). The unintended consequence of this removal has been to short-circuit the usual process by which Reddit assigns value to posts. As a result, instead of the "folks" doing the self-moderation through voting, the moderators have had their job responsibilities increased.  Each pizza-giver has a set of criteria by which he/she decides to give or not give, and those criteria are all different. In my opinion, THEY SHOULD BE different, that's what makes a wonderfully diverse world. I have certain categories of askers that automatically get me to pay more attention, and other categories which cause me to skip reading their posts entirely. I do not publicize my categories because it invites trolls and scammers. I do not require that everybody else agree with my categories/criteria. My set of criteria are right FOR ME.   You have the right to question my criteria. I have the right to ignore you.   You have the right to choose different criteria. That's fine. That's why Baskin Robbins makes 31 flavors, baby. God Bless America.  **WAY tl;dr** -- Give if you want to give, for whatever reasons you bloody well feel like. Ignore if you want to ignore. Be public about it, be private about it, do it for karma, do it for kicks, it doesn't matter. Not even a little.

t3_j1esz	1311793679.0	marianata		Request: Long week ahead after an even longer weekend - Yes, it's a repost, sorry	Hey reddit,  I've been lurking on here for a while now, and decided it was time to create my own account and maybe get some help from those within the community.  A little about my back story: I'm a 24 year old guy with no real job opportunities in the future. I've been working part time jobs as a "handyman" which essentially means I've been out in the oppressive heat for the past few months, making about $5.75/hour. I'm not complaining, at least I have a little bit of income coming in, but it is not nearly enough to help cover what little expenses I have.  I'm currently living with my brother and his girlfriend, but I hate having to mooch off him, and am trying everything in my power to get my own place. But, with the economy the way it is, it has become damn near impossible to get anything without a lot of money.  I know I don't have a sob story like others on here, but I do know my story is 100% true. I don't have a bunch of kids to feed or someone in the hospital, I'm just a guy who's life really kind of sucks at this point, who would love a nice greasy pizza :)  Even if someone can't help me out, I'm so happy to see so many people on here have gotten helped out. It's really cool to see strangers helping out other strangers. Really makes me believe in humanity once again

I've almost got our finances under control but am completely broke until Friday.  I just got laid off a month ago, my husband is working thankfully and is trying to pick up extra hours.  My one daughter has Down Syndrome and thankfully goes to school during the summer so I know she is eating well there but my other daughter and I are so incredibly hungry right now and all I have is condements and peanut butter :( I don't have family to help me out.  If anyone reading can please help me I would so greatly appreciate it.  I understand not everyone can receive pizza but I'm hoping someone reads this and can help us out today.  Thanks for reading and I hope you have a wonderful day whether or not you can help me out!  My verification code is Gok7mTgn6oVR.  Again, thanks for your consideration.

A NUTELLA PIZZA WOULD BE SO AMAZINGLY AWESOME. WITH STRAWBERRIES.  AND CHOCOLATE.  Totally unrelated: check out this girl: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khCokQt--l4   She is amazing. I haven't gotten her singing out of my head and some of you could really use a distraction right now. I know that this subreddit is for pizza, but a little injection of random awesomeness would give a nice break from all of the craziness.   Watch some of her other stuff too, she had me floored. EDIT: I just noticed the Reddit alien in the background of her 6 foot 7 foot cover! awesomenss.  That is all. I'm working on how to make a Nutella pizza work.	True
t3_j122s	1311764686.0	Evanakin88		Request- I need to find a way to help out some really good people...	Here's the story-  So my family decides they want to move but my parent's are getting up there in age and they had a house full of stuff so being the good son I am, I offer to help.   Well the problem was that there were quite a few things in the house one person couldn't get by himself, in some cases it took three grown men to move certain things, (like an old big screen TV out of the basement) anyway I needed to get a few friends together to help me get things going. Another issue I ran into was finding people, for some reason it's pretty hard to get folks to do something for nothing, and more than a few "friends" turned me away.   So here is what I want to do, I want to get the people who did help, (two other guys), something for their time and effort but I myself am flat broke, so here goes... can someone help me say 'thank you' to a couple of good Samaritans who thought they would be helping me for nothing. Any help is greatly appreciated. The main reason I ask is because I have had some luck here before and thought that I might be able to find another generous soul.  TL;DR: I need some pie to say thank you to some guys who really deserve it.  Edit : I live in the Jacksonville, Alabama area small college town lots of Za places nearby.	True

It's mainly because he gets too excited when he tries to talk(nothing speech therapy isn't going to fix). Anyhow, to the point... I'm browsing the site and he just so happens to notice the pizza symbols beside the names and he says Ca Ca Ca Can Can we have pizza tonight mommy.

Seriously, we have people attacking people in threads, hounding people they know nothing about. When are you all going to learn that the trolls live for this? The people you are driving away are the ones in need, while you are making some troll/scammers day giving them something to do, and giving them the attention that they seek.  **WE HAVE A MESSAGE THE MODS BUTTON FOR SUSPECTED SCAMMERS** , or if you must deal with it yourself pm them.  I will not see this turn into a negative community, we are here for positive reasons, and they are still happening .  We have people making announcements that they caught a scammer. Great that you called them on it, let the mods know, don't make a hate thread.  I hate to admit it, but the troll that said he was going to continue until the subreddit was ruined is doing well. Look at all this negativity.  /rant

I spent all of our money to get her home on Saturday and things are going ok for our family, but we are flat broke until Thursday. redd.it/iurkz was the link to my request last week.

I'm 25, handsome, I do well in life and I'm in no dire need for a pizza (or food for that matter) tonight.  Kidding aside, tomorrow I have a big day at work (I work from home... goddammit did I really say that?). I'll be up spending most of my day inside working on a document for a client that's due Thursday. I most likely won't take any breaks during the day (this bit belongs to /r/firstworldproblem) and having food delivered to my door would be nothing short of amazing. Plus, it's food from the internet!  Tomorrow me, the day after you, as the saying goes - or something like that...	True
t3_j0g4z	1311709699.0	rohan208		Possible addition to verification system?	I am not much active on RAOP but preffer to help out at /r/assistance so I may be unaware of the system that well. I would really like to help out more often but scamming always makes me think twice.  Would it help eliminate most of the scamming if we add  "Physical Address to ship"  to the verification system? That way, all the requester has to do is to provide the verification code, and the person helping out will get the "physical address" where the pizza needs to be sent and how many times has the "address" requested assistance in last X number of days from the site.  Couple of pro/cons:  1. So now we would know if the person has been helped recently/multiple times.  2. Would work only for shipping and not work for gift cards sent to email addresses. I usually prefer to assist by shipping items rather than sending giftcard/cash (there have been exceptions).  3. We would need to consider various permutations of address, else a user could game the system. "132NE" vs "132 NE"  4. This might be a "less embarrassing way" of asking for help than providing lots of other forms of proof.  5. People still could manage to get multiple addresses, but that kind of scamming might be limited.  6. Are we just making the subreddit worse by requesting to much info?  7. I understand that the requester will have to provide the address anyways. So we are not asking for any extra information. Ofcourse people may not like having their "Address tracked".   I would like to hear more pro/cons from   1. "Donators" - would this give you a better peace of mind?   2. People who have been helped before and would they be willing to go this route? 	True

t3_j0e1o	1311705701.0	CuzinVinny		Just caught a scammer, Mom with Four Kids Son turned 16 yesterday wanting to put a Smile on his face;-) 	Here is the original link to the convo: http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j0ajg/mom_with_four_kids_son_turned_16_yesterday/  I caught the user red handed, and they deleted their account in a heartbeat. I was a little suspicious, but decided to give it a shot.  I PM-ed the user, and after literally no time at all the user responds with some goofy message asking for real life money instead of a gift card. I ask why, and they never respond.   I hope everyone keeps a wary eye out for new accounts that claim to have 4+ kids, usually these accounts don't even attempt to follow the verification system.  Don't be scammed, just use common sense! And if you have any doubts whatsoever, please do not hesitate to contact the moderators.  Long live R.A.O.P

There are people who don't have children or so much stuff going on that they haven't ate in days, but atleast they don't lie about having children to get a free meals.... that is all thanks for reading

t3_izg5n	1311622235.0	meteorliath	frog	You are all amazing	I'm glad sites like this exist because the way I felt just a little bit ago I had just about given up on humanity.  I know that there are scammers out there and yet you all just keep going.  You look out for them and try to trust that the people here are being truthful and you are bringing a bit of light into their lives.  I recently graduated college and moved and have been searching for a job since March.  With this economy that's been no such luck.  I finally get a job offer and I can't believe it but I'm so excited that finally my fiancee wont be the only supporter and we wont be paycheck to paycheck and thanking whoever invented Ramen because it's cheap and we'll have something to eat.  But no such luck.  I go through the application, a phone interview, renewed hope, only to find out it's a scam.  My faith in people shattered, my motivation to keep going, to keep trying for a job pretty low (but I'm doing it anyway, eventually someone in Albuquerque is going to hire me, just wish it was sooner rather than later).  So I decide to just start randomly surfing the internet and notice a friend had posted something about this and this is beautiful.  You should all be so very proud of what you are doing and have done.  It's a simple pizza and maybe it's only food for a day or a couple of days and maybe it's not even that healthy but none of that is important.  What's important is you are renewing peoples faith in humanity.  You are proof that while our world seems like shit, and people are always looking to take advantage, there are still people out there who are willing to give and brighten other peoples lives even if it's just for a day.  All of you people donating deserve a standing ovation, a plaque, or trophy or something, but you all seem just as happy to get a simple thank you and that makes you all the much better.    So thank you, thank you so very much for helping to turn my day around just by doing all of this.  You are beautiful and amazing people and I know the Universe, or God, or whatever it is you believe in will pay you back some day.

The old family jalopy broke down recently and in order to make it back & forth we had to take on a car payment. This has caused Daddy to have to budget like a mofo and first on the list was junk food, etc. so pizza, unless it's a little Totino's is usually out of the question....so it sure would be nice to bust in the door LIKE A BOSS and look like a hero by bringing in some beloved pizza pie, fresh out the oven!!

I offered an ecard to someone and they told me that they didn't have a printer and would that be a problem.  But truthfully, I don't know!  Do you need a printer to print something out?

t3_iyumz	1311564567.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	ANNOUNCEMENTS - Please read regarding best practices to avoid scammers. 	As you all know we are a growing community and have our shares of growing pains.  The mods and other community members have discussed several developments and we'd like to update the community with what we feel are the best practices for avoiding trolls and scammers.  **1st) Use the verification system** - We can't make it mandatory for technical reasons; nor do we necessarily want to make it mandatory.  But if you are concerned about scammers, please use it.  It is much more robust than reddit.  It much harder to fool than simple new accounts or email address.  **2nd) If you decide to use the verification system, and your requestor complains, it is likely you have discovered a scammer.**  Most people are perfectly willing to use the system or learn how to use it.  If they complain, just ignore them and find someone else who is willing to use it.    Once again, in our experience legitimate requestors are very willing to use verification, or to provide pictures, or phone numbers, or bank statements or anything.  On the other hand, scammers use all sorts of excuses to avoid it.  Excuses like they aren't good with computers, or complaining about privacy, or start swearing and abusing you... These are all signs you have found a scammer.  Just ignore them and move along.  If you feel so inclined report them or message a mod.  **3rd) If you use a gift card, send it to your own email address and then order a pizza online using that gift card to the home address of the requestor.**  Scammers are much more hesitant to give out home addresses.  So asking for a home address will weed them out.  Using a gift card also solves the problems of drivers asking to see the credit card.  **4th) If you are really concerned about scammers consider giving only to long time or high karma redditors.**  We know there are plenty of legitimate requests from new accounts.  And there are plenty of donors from new accounts.  So take that into account, but no one will fault you for using these criteria.  5th) Please understand that there are people out there that thrive on being abusive.  They enjoy the attention they get from hurling personal insults.  This is the internet.  The best thing to do is to ignore them.  Report and message a mod if you feel so inclined.  Responding to a troll givies them the attention they are looking for.    Additionally, the mods are working on a Mod giveaway.  We have about 6 or so gift cards lined up and will be giving them away in a separate post this coming weekend.  We will be following the best practices as outlined in the sidebar and this post.  **Any regular donors who wish to join in please message us and we will arrange the details. **   Finally, thanks again for bearing with us and the community as we all learn how to make this a success.  This subreddit started small and had already accomplished more than any of us dreamed.  We are here for the long term even if it ends up with just a few of us.  **We really appreciate the wonderful spirit provided by you and your generosity. **

I am 21 years old from MA and a rising senior in college. I am interning in Los Angeles this summer and, unfortunately, I have run into major money problems because a 40 mile commute to work in stop-go traffic destroys a gas tank and the rent I pay isn't low either. I am sick of eating peanut butter  and jelly sandwiches, but I do not have enough money to buy anymore food until my extremely giving friends send me some more money.

They are the people who actually run the e-gift card sites listed on the sidebar. No matter what I did, their site would decline my order because the street address did not match. Apparently this is not an uncommon thing, they even said to just use a different card (I don't have a different card). I spent way too long on the phone with them and my credit card (who thought all the excess attempts were fraud and closed my card temporarily). Reddit - how can we convince them to make their site work better so there aren't unnecessary delays in getting people their pizzas?  EDIT - I even got out my billing statement and wrote my street address exactly as it appears, per cashstar's suggestion, no dice.	True

Buying one is a bit out of the question given the tab from last night and not receiving a paycheck until next week.   Browsing reddit is about the extent of this day. Happened to stumble upon this paradise and thought i would try my luck.   It looks like there are lot of deserving people. I should not be a very priority, but an anchovy pizza would be delicious right now. I would just eat the shit out of it.   Someone here has to know what I am talking about.   Cheers   (also Colorado and verified)  Edit: Even though no pizza was involved this was fun. No pizza necessary for me any longer (although I can't wait to send one out). Cheers!	True

Its been pretty monotonous around here until my wife and two kids get back. We have to pay for school uniforms and all the great back to school stuff so I feel a bit selfish buying a pizza. However I have eaten all the ramen, eggs, cereal, bread, everything. Come to find out the family is coming back early from vacation tommorow and I got wake up super early to get grocerys, but for tonight Im tapped out, exhausted. But when I came home I swear I looked at my dog and saw a giant chicken wing, crazy right, but thats what my mind is doing, turning my dog into the hallucination of a giant buffalo wing. IT WAS GLORIOUS!! Sounds extreme but lets just say Im not gonna guarantee the dog makes it through the night.

t3_ixcyb	1311388327.0	kencater	pizza-gold	Probably not the right Reddit, but thought the readers here would be the best audience!	So, tonight I stopped at the gas station to get Red Bull and smokes. There was a lady there who got $50.00 in gas whose credit card was being denied. I could tell by her expression that she knew the card was busted, but she was desperate. After waiting in line behind her about ten minutes, she decided to try the in-store ATM. I made my transaction and left.  When leaving the parking lot I couldn't help but notice a van with a bunch of dogs inside. The sticker on the door identified it as belonging to the One At A Time Pet Rescue. The gas pump it was beside read $50.00. I put two and two together and turned around. The lady was still at the ATM and was talking to her husband on the phone trying to figure out what to do. So I bought the gas and a coffee for her. Or rather for the animals. She had 24 dogs in the van. I work in a disaster related field in a devastated area and it was apparent that she had picked up dogs from an overrun shelter and was taking them elsewhere to be adopted out. If any of you are looking for a new friend, give them a call. also find them at www.oneatatime.petfinder.org  [DOGGIES!](http://imgur.com/dOBj7.jpg)  TL;DR If you are looking for a worthy cause to give to, consider our animal friends.  Edit: For a while there, I thought it was a bad idea to post this here, but seeing the support, I am now glad I did. In the interest of continuing the positivity, let's give away some pizza. Look at the NEW posts for more info. Give me a few minutes to put it together.	True

t3_ixao5	1311381924.0	UrbanRonin	pizza	alittlekindness.org - wheresgeorge for "pay it forward"	I've been immensely inspired by the random acts of kindness I've seen from reddit, particularly the random acts of pizza folks.  It's the sort of thing that restores faith in humanity and reminds us that we can all make an amazing difference in the world.  The company that I work for also believes strongly in giving back to the community, and we're constantly looking for ways to leverage the skills and opportunities we have to do so.  Today, we launched a website to help support folks like you.  The site has been described as a wheresgeorge.com for random acts of kindness.  It allows people to start "pay it forward" chains that allow you to follow the trails of generosity.  You create a unique code, which can be shared online or printed out and given in person to folks that you show kindness towards.  They can use the code to add notes on the website and share with everyone the generosity you showed towards them.  Then they can pass the code along to whomever they "pay it forward" to, continuing the chain.  You can go back at any time to see how much of a difference one little act of kindness can make.  I'm really excited to finally be able to share this with you guys.  You all really inspire me, and I hope our website helps inspire you as well!  [A Little Kindness](http://alittlekindness.org)  Also, in an effort to get my own chain started, I'm going to be donating a bunch of pizzas this weekend.  I'll make a separate post later for that, but if you're reading this thread and need some pizza, send me a message and I'll try to help as many folks as I can.  Thank you!!!

Roll Tide Roll	After reading some of these posts, it really warms my heart to know there are such great people out there in the world. Figured I'd throw my request out there and see what happens.  I just finished up my junior year at the University of Alabama, I'm double majoring in Marketing and Finance, so I've had to take out a whole lump of loans to pay for everything. My mom and dad help out as much as they can, but I'm the youngest of 4 and they are tapped out at this point.  I'm working as a summer intern at a local law firm, but of course they don't have to pay me anything, so I'm essentially an indentured servant to them :(  But I'll scrape by, I always have, and always will, but if anyone had it in their heart and could manage it, I would love a pizza over the weekend. I've got some girlfriends coming over, and for some reason a wine and pizza night sounds pretty great right now.  Roll Tide 	
t3_iww4m	1311349734.0	tugz101		Very hungry family of 4 would love pizza.	I've just recently found out about this site and I'm amazed at how many people are actually helping out here. I thought sites like this were impossible. It's so nice what you guys are doing. Anyway... I just moved to South Florida after living in Georgia for 7 years. I live with my two younger siblings and my disabled mother. My mother and I are both unemployed. I was let go from my job a few months back after becoming homeless. We were moving around from place to place and I couldn't make it to work all the time and was let go after working there for a year. One of my mother's last unemployment checks got us into this small apartment we're living in now, so I'm not worried about a place to live for time being. But what does worry me is food. We've not had a good meal for weeks. All we've had is some canned goods from a pantry, and even that's running low. I'm hoping to get a job soon and get back on my feet, but until then we're pretty much screwed.   If anybody could find it in their heart to help us, I would appreciate it soo much.   I'm very new to this and don't know how it works. I've read the rules on the side and it says something about a Verification code. I don't know what it's for, but I'll gladly give it to you if you need it. Just tell me if you need any more info.   Thank you so much.  Sincerely,  Brett

I was laid off last week from my job of 5 years, they are downsizing, which I guess means my boss is taking a bigger paycheck this year and I was expendable.  For the cherry on top, my old '93 Honda Civic broke down on me, it's sitting in the shop, and I don't want to pay for that POS to be fixed, but I have no other offers.  I'm a single guy, no girlfriend or wife or children that I know of, so I don't have a lot of mouths to feed, but I would love to at least stuff my face with something greasy and warm tonight and wallow in my sorrows.

t3_ivxn0	1311265053.0	marko419	shroom	Would like to surprise my wife and son with dinner-- Just financially strapped right now	Hello, My name is Marko and I have a wonderful wife who is pregnant with our second son. I also have a 2 year old named Jonathan. My wife has been amazing with our son and she always has dinner ready when I come home and I just want to give her a break. She is 9 months pregnant and I can tell she is so tired. But we are strapped for cash and I don't want to worry her. I think if I brought pizza home and surprised her it would just alleviate some of her concerns. Any little bit helps.... Thank you very much for reading this; Marko marko419@hotmail.com

Big Thanks going out to all who have contributed. This is a powerfully positive thing even if there are those who would take advantage or take for granted others kindness. Kindness is still the best way - I think because it generally tends to multiply itself to a certain degree.    I've had a few pizzas on request and had one given to me in a truly random way, which was fun. I'm fondly looking forward to the day when I can pay it all forward in pepperoni.  **edit:** As a side note: I came *close* to getting a tattoo of a stinky slice of pepperoni pizza on my shoulder when I was 18. I didn't do it but now I'm thinking about it. ;)	True

My two daughters and son are my rock and my world, why I get out of bed in the morning to work a job where I'm underpaid and busting my back day in and day out.  I would love to be able to surprise them with a nice little pizza treat at some point, try to boost their spirits during this rough patch in our lives.  I would love to be on here with a different story, one in which I'm able to give out pizza to those struggling within the community, and hopefully, who knows, I might be able to at some point.  All I know is that I will pay it forward in any way possible when I can.

t3_iuu59	1311172011.0	providence_presence		I don't know where to start	Let me first preface this by saying that I always considered myself a proud person; and by posting this here I feel guilty, but I haven't eaten in four days and someone pointed me here soo.  Basically I was living with my now ex-gf for a year and a half up until the other day, when she moved out overnight.  She threw out my food, spilled water on my books, stole ~$300 cash and now shes leaving me stuck with the bills and next months rent which I can't afford.  I am broke.  Literally all I have is a fucking hat filled with pennies.  I haven't eaten in four days, and I'm getting scared.  I already can't walk more than a couple feet without feeling exhausted.  If someone could help me out in my rock bottom moment, then I will do the same for you, once I get back on my feet.  I'm not picky at all, I just need something in my stomach for strength.  I've barely been able to feed myself this past month.  Thanks for reading this and I hope you don't take basic things for granted like I once did.	
t3_iusix	1311168319.0	Deborah111111		Request	Hi, my name is Deborah. I used to help run Burlington Emergency Shelter in Burlington, VT. It is a shelter to help provide housing for up to 22 homeless men and women. They only run on donations. No Federal or State funding is used. They rely on donations to provide a meal each night for their guests. Their guests are ordinary people that either lost their jobs or just couldn't work anymore. I personally know what it is like to be homeless as I had went to the shelter in need myself.  I would like to request that someone or some people would provide pizzas for a meal for the homeless. 10 pizzas would be enough. If anyone would like to help, you can find the shelter's website at beshelter.org. It would make alot of someone very happy!

I was told that it would be included in my "available balance" 6pm MST, however it has still not shown up. The banks are now closed, my account in still negative, and I am stuck at work till 11 pm. I was counting on ordering something once the funds were available, but alas I will be hungry tonight. Unless there is a kind soul out there who responds to this message.   P.S. - This is the first time I have done something like this, and would love to repay the favor for someone tomorrow.

t3_itxnh	1311092691.0	DEStudent	PIF	REQUEST- Couldn't make this one up if I tried...	Hello all: I'm writing to ask for pizza although I did receive one about 2 or 3weeks ago. If I get a pizza, great, but at this point I just need to get this off my chest. My husband has a son from a previous marriage and we got a call from his mother in another state that he was out of control and she was kicking him out. My husband offered to come pick up his son. So we scrambled around trying to get a rental car (ours does not have AC and it was over a 2hr drive) and spent money we didn't really have after paying late fees on the rent. So we used our last bit of money, but the "baby mama" said she would give the money back when we arrived. We called to let the boy's mother know we were on the way and come to find out, he ran away. We arrived and began looking for this boy. He is 16y/o and left home without an ID or money. We were there from 0930 until 6pm and never found him. My husband had to come home because he had to work in the morning. His mother heard from him that he's okay, but won't say where he is. All day yesterday, I sat by my phone awaiting a call. He lives in a major metropolitan city and we fear possible drug use. His father is heart broken and his the boy's mother never called us AT ALL YESTERDAY. Imagine not knowing if your son is alive or dead... My husband called this morning and she said he's okay, but just won't come home...  I know there are truly needy and hungry people on this forum. I was just hoping for a little pizza to try to take away some of the pain. We don't drink, smoke or do drugs. We have spaghetti noodles and potatoes which I don't mind. Some food is better than none, but we are really hurting. I know we always joke about the evil stepmother, but I do love and care for this boy. His problem is, he's out of control and doesn't want to live with Dad outside of NJ because there's not much going on here.  I guess that's it. I just need to write to heal my heart a little.  This is my verification code: Dj/r58ixiiNA  Time may heal all wounds, but a pizza would be nice also.  Thank you all for listening and caring. If you have your children safe and sound, hug them a little tighter.   *update: my stepson is here with us. He came after being escorted by police. He is very depressed. His mom told him this was just a week visit, only to see all of his things here. Working with him and will seek professional help. Still would love to treat him and husband to pizza tonight. Thank you*	True
t3_iu87p	1311112836.0	chuckbartowski30117		Hi there, my name is Chuck, and here are a few things that you may need to know	2 years ago I had a super government computer downloaded into my brain. I have two top level government handlers assigned to me. There is John Casey, the gun loving, grunt communicating, NSA agent who couldn't crack a smile if his life depended on it. And then there is Sarah Walker, my beautiful, blonde haired, blue eyed girlfriend.   Right now, I am deep undercover in an undisclosed location. Since I am so deep undercover, the use of cell phones, credit cards, and computers is forbidden. But, thanks to my best friend Morgan Grimes, you are receiving this information.  This morning, while looking out the window of my safe house, I saw a man dressed as a Dominos delivery man. I flashed, and discovered his real name is Dmitry Zvonareva, a spy with Fulcrum. He is known for dressing up as a delivery boy, hiding a knife in the pizza box, and right when you think you're about to enjoy a delicious pizza, you get killed. Gives a whole new meaning to getting a slice!   He hasn't found the exact house I'm in, but hes in the neighborhood and getting close. I'm sending this message to everyone in hopes that someone can help me. I need a pizza, or a egift card sent to Morgan Grimes right away. He'll order the pizza, and with John Casey dressed as a pizza man, he can capture Dmitry and we can figure out what secrets he knows. Its the only way. Send me a PM. Lets get these bastards.  Bartowski out.

t3_iu0nd	1311098245.0	katlol	PIF	Pizza for my girl in Eugene, OR	My girlfriend recently had surgery. A tumor was removed from her neck and she was out of work for 3 weeks. When she did go back to work, she was given shorter hours temporarily, which greatly helped her to acclimate back to working full time.   I, however, am unemployed (I sell shirts on Etsy), so even though this was all finished by May, she's still struggling to keep up with bills. I've loaned her a bit of money (I have $200 to my name, saved up over the course of 6 months) and that helped, but she's still living pay check to pay check, and she doesn't spend excess money on random crap (she's used to being able to buy extra fun stuff when she wants, so she's been a bit down).   I'd love to buy her pizza to cheer her up, but as I have so little money and so little income, I know that's not the smartest move financially. Thanks for your consideration =D

t3_ity9v	1311093822.0	southerngent13	shroom	(Request) Hate to ask, but fallen on some very hard times.	Hey guys,  This is a throwaway account, I'm more than willing to go through the verification system if need be.    I could really use a helping hand right now.  I've been unemployed for 6 months now, haven't been able to find much work in Birmingham other than some manual labor.  I'm not complaining, I'll do anything I have to support myself.  I'm trying to cut out all expenses in my life, got rid of my phone, internet, sold my tv, so I'm in the library using their internet and their AC.  To add insult to injury, rubbing dirt on the wound, I had to put down my chocolate lab over the weekend.  Layla was getting old, she was a great lab, and I'm torn up inside right now.  I know it's childish, but I would love to sit down with a nice pizza, something I haven't had in as long as I can remember and just kinda zone out, at least for the night.

t3_it6n3	1311024238.0	kristekitty		YAY IIVIIP3!  very long, sorry!	so last night he found a post from a woman claiming to be mother and in bad way. she had posted twice and he posted offer on first one, so i let him know she'd posted again and her that he was offering. he was so touched he offered a $100 gift card. yeah, right?  but then it got sad. she/he started with the can't access send it here and he realized it was new account and when he called them on it, they deleted their posts and ran away. he was sad and wrote me, saying i seemed nice and thought i'd like to know outcome.  at same time i'd been talking to woman in motel with her small kids. her oldest was sad about missing potter so i gave her link to watch it and apologized i couldn't send pizza. back in october i was her, in motel due to bad situation with my kids so we talked awhile. when iiviip3 wrote, i mentioned her and how she seemed real, and staying in motel might make it easier to check.   and so being the pizza superhero he is he leapt to the rescue! faster then melting cheese, he sent a gift card of nom nom to her and joined our conversation about how awesome the waffle makers are at motels. i remember how sad i was, and what a failure i felt like as mom, when i was in this woman's spot. and thought of her pizza man sending her food while she could treat her son to the movie as well, it made me all sniffly inside! she hasn't been back yet to say thank you, but i want the world to know he's a god, not the god, but a pizza god for sure!  oh, and did i mention he sent me a gift card too? just because he said i seem like type he wanted to help? even after i told him i had food? yeppers! and i think that card will be used for the friend who told me to pack up kid's puters and come stay with her the week before we were able to get a motel, despite her only having $13 for 5 days and 4 of us, so it was a gift card that is still giving!   i don't know how any of you choose who to help, or how you keep going after being scammed, but you all amaze me! i honestly don't know how i'll choose when it's my turn to give, so i'll probably be looking to you all for advice. that said, if any of you need help trying to choose, i'll try to help you as well!   YAY FOR ALL THE AWESOMENESS CONTAINED ON THIS SMALL SITE!

This is my 2nd request for help. too many people play and say they will help and do not take a family's situation seriously. WE are in Need soooo Bad! I worked for Wells Fargo for 11 years and was laid off and now my unemployment ended last month. I have applied for foodstamps and was told it could take up to 30 days. in the mean time my kids and I are suppose to do what? there is too much red tape and people and even whole families are starving. we dont know what we are going to do. it is ashamed that the government is not more worried about its citizens starving. our need is great, and it is hard to have to worry all the time about how I am going to feed my kids. Please, if someone can send me and my family a pizza we would appreciate it. Thanks,  Deborah I can verify with the REDDIT verification system if you need me too.

Pretty much anything bad you could imagine going bad in one's life, it has happened to me.  All my family is in Colorado, so moving out there is pretty much out of the questions. So right now I'm crashing on my buddies couch, but I'm not sure how long that will last or how long until he loses his mind and kicks me out.  I would love to be able to pay him back someway or another, and pizza popped into my mind. Being as it is a Friday night, and I don't have the fund to do much anything but breathe and drink free water, I'm not going out tonight. Anyone have it in their heart to help out a fellow human being whose life has hit the skids? 	
t3_isw6m	1311004484.0	nomewe	shroom	{Request} Mommy of three looking for a little help while my husband is looking for work.	I just want to start off by saying how wonderful this community is. I've been looking at some of these posts on here, and how helpful and giving those within the community have been, and it really warms my heart to know there are people like that out there in the world.  I'm wondering if there a chance someone would be willing to help me out as well. I'm a stay at home mom, raising my three little ones, Jason (6) and Michelle and Christina (both 3 1/2), while my husband works. Sadly, he lost his job about a year ago, and with this economy, he has only been able to pick up jobs here and there, and we're getting towards the end of our savings.  I would love to be able to sit down with a nice pizza dinner one night, and just be able to relax and enjoy the company of one another, that is, before the little ones start crying again. Pizza used to be a luxury purchase for us before, now it is almost impossible.  Anyone with a soft spot in their heart able to help out?  Thanks

I think overall the community is a wonderful place so far.  The news stories have brought a large influx of people, but I don't think the community has been adversely impacted besides the larger amount of traffic we've been seeing.  Most of the negativity has gone away and I'd like to keep it that way.  Some interesting notes that I've noticed:  * Weekends are the slowest days of the week Sundays are especially slow.   * Wednesdays are the highest traffic days.  Oh yeah, and new icon.  The other day in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ip2hr/request_in_a_money_knot_right_and_i_dont_get_my/) we were talking about a new icon for people that have previously given and now need  a pizza.  I call it forward a pizza.  You can see it in action at that link!  Also: read the sidebar if you haven't please.  Lastly, keep in mind, verification codes are one time use only.  **KEEP IT PRIVATE** and only send to the person requesting it to give you a pizza.  edit:  I was so hasty to give out the new icon I didn't realize Bottleman Pizza'd it Forward again.  I'll change his icon back to Pizza it Forward on Monday so you can still check out the new icon for the time being.	True

t3_irfqm	1310841797.0	ifyoulovejesus		My cat probably needs more help then I do, but she can't hold down a job.	My cat had a seizure this morning, and I had to take her to the vet. I've only had her for a month, and I adopted her from a house of folks (hippies) who haven't gotten her any of her shots a few moths ago. I just dropped her off this morning and got a call back from the vet. She hasn't had any vaccinations, isn't fixed, and needs bloodwork to figure out her seizure problem(s). It could be nothing, but i'm looks at a bill close to the $500 dollar area. It could also be FIV. I'm too much of a cat lover to say no, but that is pretty much all of my cash minus rent and bills. I work graveyard at a Plaid Pantry (convenience store). This pizza would be more of a "hold me over til my next paycheck" kind of mood lifter, and I would be down to reciprocate on my next paycheck or the one after I hope. I'm just bummed, hungry, and afraid to spend any money for now. I know they say you shouldn't take in a cat if you can't withstand the financial burden, It's just that I thought I could do better than some random punk/hippie house that obviously wasn't prepared to even get her fixed or get her shots after more than a year. thanks. I have a confirmation code, but i'm not sure what that does. I hope it isn't wrong to post it here.  EJUTUoBBF0jE

t3_iqol5	1310758049.0	Easy_eddit		Would gladly pay it forward Tuesday for a Papa John's pizza today.	Hey redditors,  This is a throw away account, just to get that out there.  This week has been really tight on money, paycheck didn't cover everything that I expected it to, therefore I don't have any food for the weekend beside week old pasta which I'm less than excited to eat.  I get another paycheck on Tuesday, and at that point I will be paying to forward to the next out of luck guy, even if I don't get lucky enough to get a pizza today.  That being said, anyone have it in them to help out a dude willing to help out another dude playing another dude on Tuesday?

t3_iqjfs	1310748000.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	WARNING - Double Check Usernames Carefully - We've had a couple of reports of people using similar usernames to scam.  	We've had reports of scammers intercepting offers with usernames and email addresses close to, but not exactly like the original non-scamming username.  For example, the scammer will replace 0 with Os or transpose numbers and letters.  The verification system would help with this problem since it will indicate if the requestor has asked before.  But it is not foolproof and you will need to doublecheck the username in any case.  If you discover you are a victim of this type of scam, cashstar can reverse the gift card if you catch it in time.  If you are a person that has scammed this way or are tempted to do this.  I hope that some point our race will grow up enough that your kind ceases to exist.  Truly shame on you.

t3_ipwqe	1310686048.0	y485		trying again- Hungry in Hartford, CT- Will forward this pizza next month	I tried several days ago with no luck- this is a new account, but i have a verification code and can provide any other proof you might want/need  I'm with my friend in Hartford. I lost my job, and lost my apartment i was sharing with my friend. With finding small jobs doing manual labor like lawn mowing, we scraped enough money to get into a small apartment but we have nothing except a 8 year old laptop, and my neighbor's wifi that he is letting us use for the time being. We have a bit less than 5 bucks, and we would rather not have ramen again. I know that this is a new account and understand if you are skeptical and if there is anything i can do to reassure you, i will. I did the verification thing on the right toolbar if that helps. I am sure there are many people that need help even more than we do, but we would greatly appreciate it. I will give someone in need a pizza when i get the money to. Any offers are appreciated. Maybe i should add a bit more about myself. I used to work at a clothing store that went under. I worked full time, and i participated in Habitat for Humanity's Rebuilding Hartford and Rebuilding Manchester to help those who lack proper housing. I came from an abusive family, so i left right when i turned 18. No college education, and barely finished highschool. Then i met my friend who came from a similar background when i was about 18 and a half years old. We lived together and supported each other ever since- through the bad and the good. At one point, we opened a small cell phone accessory store, which went into bankruptcy with the economy. Ever since, we have been trying to find decent jobs to support ourselves. We were both laid off recently (he previously worked at a Arby's which changed ownership and their whole staff) We will definitely pay this forward when we get the chance, but right now (this month) is very hard for us. We just need a little boost to know that there is someone out there that cares. Again, there might be people more in need, but hopefully "the pizza sauce will eventually reach us" Thanks for reading  I would prefer a e-card to Dominos because i have some coupons, but i guess thats up to you  Verification code: zKjqoNwUR6wu	True

t3_ipu2h	1310680270.0	lilmiz1127	shroom	{Request} INDIANA Single disabled mom recently out of hospital still would appreciate a hot pizza tonight!	Im 39 years old, the nature of my disability is called CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneruopathy) My immune system attacks my neurological system. The protective covering of my nerves is being eaten away from my own antibodies. This causes horrendous pain 24/7, and at times my body shuts down and I end up in the hospital out of pure exhaustion. I just got out of the hospital, and Im not yet able to get to the grocery store, and Im still a bit weak and not feeling too well. ( I dont drive anymore) We'd really enjoy a hot pizza. I have a teen and a 10 year old here, we'd just enjoy a hot pizza for a change.  I get Social Security Disability as income and part of a court ordered child support, and I just go over the limit for food stamps in my county. This really is a temporary situation until I can get out to the store and food pantry in a few days, and nobody nearby to get stuff for us. If someone needs proof of my disability, I can show my SS award letters perhaps or scan in copies of my discharge papers if needed to prove Ive been in the hospital.  I posted this before and one person did offer a pizza but never followed through on the offer or responded back to us as promised. Please only offer if you can follow through, we were VERY disappointed.

t3_ip4iz	1310616818.0	fordandt	pizza-gold	Don't understand all the unkindnesses on a kindness site...	I came to this site a couple of days ago, specifically because I saw the report on ABC news and wanted to help some hungry folks in a direct and immediate way. (Don't know if you can tell, but I've donated to four different--and very appreciative-- families already.) My point is that no one seems to mind that I'm new here since I'm a "giver."  But why be so harsh on others who also are new, just because they've come to "receive?" I'm sure folks like me who saw the news report, etc., would quite possibly mention this site to follks who could use the help. Why do so many insist that recipients be previous Reddit members? A hungry soul is a hungry soul, and folks like me who want to help out the best we can are really turned off by the negativity (and sometimes downright hostility, rudeness and mean-spirited words) of those who seem to have made it their business to inspect every post for possible "unfairness," "cheating," or whatever. Just because someone's been a long-time member of Reddit is no guarantee of their need being legit. And, conversely, just because someone is new to this site doesn't by rights make them a scammer. (I'm not a fake giver just because I'm new here.) I expect we all take a small risk that we're not helping out the neediest when we respond with a pizza, but that's a risk most givers here seem willing to take.  It's a pizza, not the Hope diamond.  In my opinion, a more beneficial way to enhance this site would be to dispense with the negative and hurtful comments, and to make the instructions WAY easier on newcomer givers like me who had a heck of a time figuring this site out the first day. (I searched blogs for assistance since the FAQs didn't give me the answers I sought, and I found many others who wanted to give but gave up when they couldn't figure it out.)  I think this site has the makings of something truly wonderful; just how about making it a more positive experience for all?

t3_iot9k	1310592236.0	jillynn	shroom	Senior citizen could use some dinner	Hello,  My neighbor across the hall be getting out of the hospital for blood clots and pneumonia. He is doing a lot better and I have made sure his medicine has been picked up and that the nurse comes to look in on him and that his books and magazines are all nearby. He has no family and we have become friends. I noticed when I was tidying up his apartment before he got home that he has very little food. He normally goes to a food pantry to supplement his very meager income, and I suppose he wasn't able to make it because of the hospital stay this week. I was able to buy a few basics for him but I don't have much money myself until payday and having a pizza or two would really help him to not only eat, but would be easy for him to heat up so he wouldn't have to get out of bed too often.I'd be happy to re-pay the karmic pizza favor on payday.

Yes, I'm new to the community, no I didn't hear about it through the news reports the other day, but rather heard about it from a family friend.    In the past month, my life has essentially fallen apart.  My wife of 15 years has all but thrown in the towel to our marriage.  She has moved back in with her parents, and I'm living in our house with our two children, Jennifer & William.  Along with this added stress, I've just lost my job as a management consultant.  So now I'm left with a broken heart, a hole in my pocket and two hungry kids to feed.  We're not in as terrible of a position as other members on here, but I was wondering if a kind member would be willing to donate a pizza so I can surprise my kids at some point, and hopefully help them get their minds off our current situation.   Thank you all so much for even reading this.	True
t3_iokob	1310575646.0	kat61	shroom	(Request) Recently widowed mother looking to surprise her son 	I'm new to this community, turned on by a friend the other day, and I figured I'd give it a shot and see what happens. I was about to post my request, but I feared it would get mixed in with everyone else's and get lost.  My son and I have fallen on some hard times recently. His father passed away about a month ago from a massive heart attack (they call it a widow-maker heart attack, go figure), and we've just been slammed with a bunch of expenses. Jason, my son, is taking it really hard. He's about to turn 15, and his father was his idol.  I would love to surprise him with a pizza some night, maybe get his mind off the whole situation, but I just can't swing it financially at this point, and was wondering if you were still helping out those within the community.  If not, I completely understand, you've provided a huge service to this community already, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Thank you so very much

t3_io2x4	1310527499.0	BossNobody	shroom	Thanks redditors and hlmre for your help.	So the other day I requested my first pizza. I was pretty hesitant on telling people my story. But I glad I did, I've been under stress for these past few months with all that has been going on. The post I made has allowed me to get things off my chest and the pizza brought some joy.  When we first got the pizza there was a bit of a mix up, but apparently it sorted itself out. I felt bad afterwards though cause it felt like I was falsely accusing you doing something wrong hlmre. The guy was asking for money and no one home had it at the time. I didn't really make it apparent to my family that I was asking for pizza from some one I didn't know. I didn't want them to really feel bad about our situation, so I told them a friend sent it and when they were with me at the door, I acted like it was fine when I gave them my credit info. I had 35 dollars to get me through the month it would have been a bit hit, sorry I over reacted.   I would hate to ask for pizza again, so I'm trying my best to make it stretch. Hopefully those pizzas can go to people who need it more. But if I do, I hope I can come back here again.  When I get a new job, had to quit my old one cause I wanted to spend more time with my dad when it seemed like he was going to die, I hope I can return the favour to another redditor.	True

t3_iny52	1310516870.0	crmacjr	pizza	Just an Idea	I know this has its drawbacks (and may be wholly impractical) but I feel it would bring the level of scamming way down. This could even just be implemented only periodically as needed: no pizza unless you have given first. I know some people cannot afford it for themselves in the first place but, "one bad apple ruins the bunch". I got this idea from our "sick bank" at work. You give a little time when you can and, in time of need, you are eligible for a withdrawal of much more. Kind of like how some redditors have been paying it forward. If scamming seems to be ruling, put RAoP on "red alert" and limit the receivers to previous givers only.

t3_inr2g	1310502433.0	workroom	pizza	FYI: Domino's is way easier to order a eCard from than Pizza Hut	sorry, "an" eCard...  Pizza hut sends you an email with a phone number to call to verify your identity... then after sitting on   hold you're asked the referral order #, then sit on hold as they "pull that info up"... then get asked the  bank who issued your credit card, then 800 customer service number on that card, then the nearest cross street where you live!?  **edit:** annnnnnd now after all of that I just got an email saying the order could not be processed (after I went through all of that with the person on the phone and ending with her saying "ok I'll go ahead and put that through")  **edit #2: annnd now Domino's didn't go through...** seriously, **fuck cashStar**. they apparently called the wrong phone number when trying to varify the identity (*after I had just gotten off the phone with the customer service rep!!*) and they got some woman, who of course said she knew nothing about any pizza or credit card charge, so now I can't use my card at all with cashStar.

I understand that some people are taking advantage, and I am all for calling them out on it, but please be nice. Lately I have seen more replies downing on people, who may be in actual need, than replies that offer assistance.   Some of these replies have gotten really nasty. If you're going to question someones need please be prepared to buy them a pizza. It is up to the giver to gain the proof if they want any.   By all means, if you **KNOW FOR A FACT** that someone is taking advantage, scamming, or whatnot, post a reply, but keep it rated G.    If you see someone gaming the system a nice post pointing out the past requests, or pizzas they have gotten is all that is needed. Your reply will be read by others. There is no need to threaten people, or down on them.    TL;DR : This sub is supposed to be a nice, helpful group. I see it moving in the opposite direction. Let's all work on this. Thanks.

t3_ilubb	1310332363.0	Rollout	Rollout	Our verification system is up and running. (more details inside)	Before anyone tells us this, we know it is not fool proof. Our hope is that this will discourage a lot of people from gaming the system. As snang put it, if someone goes through all the trouble to fool this for a 10 dollar pizza let em have it.....  The way it works is simple. If a giver wants a verification from a person who requests, the requester goes to the site, enters their email, and gets a code. They then give this code to the giver.   The only info the giver sees is the email address, and how many times a person is suspected of getting a pizza. The info is based upon many factors, ip address, cookies, browser type, OS, and more. Givers can see if the person just got the code, as it will say requests in the hour, and the day, and so on, and have a history of other requests if applicable....  **This is not mandatory use ** it is just an optional system for people to use to help circumvent abuse.    I hope by saying we know this is not fool proof, but is an improvement, will keep the griping to a minimum.   Special thanks to our programmer rikbrown  This is housed at http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com      Let us know of any problems you may have.   Ninja edit: I would like to point out that after careful discussion on all this, we did decide, and made it so, that all info collected is encrypted, and can not be viewed by anyone (not even us).

t3_il4rq	1310245135.0	whuntfam	shroom	Problems with the Pizza Hut system	First off, thanks so much to the efforts of people who are doing good deeds on here. I can't commend you enough!  Yesterday was a pretty big day in our family. We couldn't afford to do anything and were fortunate enough to be treated to pizza...or so we thought :( I got the eCard printed, went online to pizzahut.com and tried to order. The local store wouldn't take online orders. Nevertheless, I placed an order old school style and when I presented them with the eCard, they said they had never seen one and had no way to scan it. The management told me it was worthless there and couldn't be used, despite it saying it was good at any Pizza Hut. I'm sure you can imagine my embarrassment and disappointment when I had to tell the family that it was cereal or ramen noodles for dinner on our big day. I called Pizza Hut H.Q. at 1-800-948-8488 and the lady tried telling me that eCards can only be redeemed online. I told her it said "good at any Pizza Hut" and she filed my complaint away. I wonder if any other people have had similar issues with Pizza Hut, Papa John's Domino's, etc.? It's just really rotten that folks are doing good deeds, only to see this happen. Maybe some others could call around to the numbers on the cards and find out what's up...

t3_ikru0	1310197990.0	freefaith	FAP	The best random can get.	So I have seen many offer, request, and thank you threads but have not seen as many real "Random" acts of pizza. I feel as though these are more planned out asking for something giving to someone that wants one. Not very random to me. So I went out today before work and went to the pizza hut in my town and bought some couples lunch. I am going to do it again tomorrow but this time I want to just offer some random person I meet in town out to lunch for a pizza. Or just leave a card. I am creating one as I type, just trying to think of what to put on here. I am hoping more people see this and want to do the same, its the random acts of pizza in me and I want to make a difference.   A couple things to people that want to do this. If you feel shy about any of this just do what I did at first just hold out a 20 and tell them to pay for a ticket around that amount or something to that extent or if you want to help but feel even more shy about it pm me and we can talk further.   I want this to extend to everyone having a shitty day that helping out someone who doesn't expect this and leaving a card that shows that some kindness is left in the world is all some people need to keep trudging their day. So lets get Random!  Here is the rough draft for the card I will leave.   http://i.imgur.com/2vyPV.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/pfESe.jpg  EDIT: Walked into Pizza hut today and looked around, there was a couple sitting next to the wall that I could barely see. Found my prey. Waitress walked up and I told her I would like to pay for their meal. Anything I should tell them? Just give them this *hands card over*. Thank you. Left.	True
t3_ikqo1	1310193569.0	atinasutherland	PIF	bakersdozen13 put me in a food coma! Story inside. Thank you a trillion times over. 	Long story short: I had my jaw broken on 4/30/2011. I am a chef and until tonight, hadn't chewed/eaten anything since 4/29/2011.  The taste, the texture but more importantly, the sharing, made me realize why I became a chef in the first place.   Pizza, a pasta bowl and lava cakes! That meal was the best I've ever had. Every bite mattered.   The kindness shown blows my mind. Thank you bakersdozen13. You gave me the best gift I've ever had. Eating, to me, was never taken for granted. In fact, it inspired me to become a chef. Flavors, texture and the way food feels in the body and mind amazes me.  I'll sleep well tonight because my body has that nutrition. Something I haven't had in a long time either.   I'll post my story (with pictures!) tomorrow here as well as an AMA if anybody is interested.  TL,DR: bakersdozen13 put me in a food coma and is amazing!

t3_ikmdr	1310181348.0	tonyjr11	shroom	thanks	just wanted to say thank you to the kind people that helped us with the pizza's, we recieved two comments from people that thought we are here just to get free pizza. that is not true, we are really in need of help, and we do know there is alot of people out there that really needs it too. looking on the board lately i can see why those two would think that we are here just to scam, there is some that would make say hmmmm. but all in all, i think the most of the people that request are really in need of a pizza, which brings smiles to the people who recieve it. i hope everyone who reads my history does not think bad of us, we never meant for that to happen. even though we still need help, this is just a letter to everone that has brought a smile (pizza) to people that needs it, you really make a day that seams like there is no hope for the human race.....better, one pizza at a time, god bless you all, and i really hope that i can be one of the people that brings a smile to someone in need, soon.	
t3_iklog	1310179433.0	dadneedshelp		Desperate dad in need of help	I am a father of 2 (31 years old) and my ex divorced me 2 years ago when she "fell in love" with another man. She is more successful than I am because while I only have a bachelors (I supported her and the kids through law school as a stay at home dad),  she has a law degree. When she remarried she immediately went to court to try and gain full custody of the children and is trying to win the court battle by having more monetary resources. I work full time and make a good wage, but its 1/3 of what she makes and she has a spouse and an army of lawyers working pro bono for her cause (lawyers stick together I guess?). I've even considered selling my condo and renting an apartment just so I can keep up with the court costs to fight for my ability to see my children. I just had the kids this past weekend and I spent every last earthly dollar I had on making sure they had a good time. I have ramen, but I am so tired of eating chicken flavored water. Can reddit help? I also feel really embarrassed for even asking.  EDIT: I'm too tired to stay up. I made myself some ramen and eggs with toast. Goodnight Reddit. Maybe another day.	True

Summer is always really hard financially and so we never celebrate...This Summer it's seriously just been one crappy thing after another. Now, yesterday i wake up to find there is still only $2 in our account unitl the 15th because my husband's job switched to Summer pay dates...and that pay is only for a measley 26 hours. If it's in someone's heart to provide my family of 6 with Pizza for dinner it would be great. I've applied for food stamps but will not receive any for 6 more days...Proof provided to those that request it :o)	
t3_ik2xk	1310138813.0	momof2inms	shroom	(REQUEST) Family in Ms could use a little lift	EDIT: I have been offered pizza for my family, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  I'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.  My husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the "world" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.  I applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.  Anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.  We are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.  I'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.  I want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.  I'm not sure what kind of proof I could give? His checks are direct deposited with no stubs mailed yet. Let me know what I need, I can try to figure out something to prove if requred.	True

t3_ijlg1	1310088199.0	whuntfam	shroom	Depressed family of 4 in WV	I never thought I would ask anyone for something, especially something like pizza. When I was younger, I dismissed people like this as "no-good bums". We are a family of 4 in West Virginia (2 teenage boys) and I am unable to work. My wife recently lost her job that was holding things down and still paying the bills. She was able to find a lesser (much lesser) paying job, and despite it, still works her butt off! Add this to the fact that we have had to move back to take care of ill family, it has been extremely stressful. I don't go anywhere and we feel pretty far apart from society at this point. Tomorrow is a pretty big day - one of our boys has a birthday and it is our  anniversary. I think if I told her some random person had taken it upon themselves to do a good deed, it would bring her to tears. Eventually, I know we'll be the ones doing the deed. Until then...

I am married to a hard working, wonderful man, who won't be off work tonight until midnight.  He works long hours making $2.13 an hour plus tips, but recently he hasn't been making as much as he used to due to the place doing poorly.  I have never been in such a tight financial situation before.  We've never gotten any type of assistance or food stamps or anything like that, and I've NEVER asked anyone for help, but a friend of mine told me about this website and I figured I wasn't too proud to give it a try.  We are in the process of buying our first home in a better area for our children.  On the 22nd of July is our scheduled closing, and we haven't used ANY money from our last two paychecks so that we could scrounge up the last $1800 of our closing costs and downpayment for our home.  We paid our earnest money and appraisal amount already, but this is the last we have to pay.  I currently have $1783 to my name, with our next check coming on the 20th. We have been sweating this closing for months now hoping it all goes correctly, but we have been cutting all kinds of corners to make it happen.  Our mortgage officer told us we weren't even allowed to get a credit card during the time because one change in credit could make it all fall through!  We have been eating Ramen noodles, water, and milk for two months now - no kidding!  We are doing all we can for ourselves, but I would love to have an actual DINNER.  My pregnant belly and two little boys would appreciate it more than you ever know.  I just keep telling myself we have to make it through this month and then we'll SAVE money owning a home... but things have been so so tough.  If anyone helped us out, I would forever appreciate it and definitely pay it forward to another person in the near future!  I remember two years ago I ordered pizza for a friend of mine that was a single mother in another state... I had no idea places like this even existed... but I promise I will pay this forward!  If I need to provide any type of documentation I most certainly will.	True
t3_iimck	1310002388.0	Smoopid	shroom	{Request} Pizza for My family and I in Hervey Bay, Queensland. Australia.	Hello RAOP, First of all I would just like to say that My family and I are not starving, So if someone else is in need of food to survive PLEASE help them before us.  My family (Wife and 2 lovely daughters) and I  have moved states and are having a terrible time finding a job. We are somehow scraping by and keeping up to date with our bills but meals have slowly become frugal affairs ( Still healthy ) but rice and vege's with maybe 1 - 2 times a week a little meat can get old real fast.  I would love to surprise my family with a delicious Pizza and hopefully in the not too distant future be able to give back to RAOP and keep this awesome subreddit alive.  Thankyou Redditors :) And a special thanks to the creator of RAOP!! Awesome idea. (Gives me hope for humanity)	True

t3_ii9fs	1309973016.0	bcarsisi	shroom	Family of 4 looking for help, with opportunity to pay it forward.	I usually wouldn't ask for help, but this is for my family: I am physically unable to work, at least temporarily, possibly permanently. My wife recently lost her job of 9 years that we thought would last forever due to cutbacks. She means the world to me and I appreciate the effort she makes on a daily basis. We have relocated and are trying to get settled in. We thought we would be o.k. to get started somewhere new, but now we have a family member in the hospital and it is overwhelming. My wife's birthday is Friday and things are just kinda bleak right now. If someone is able to give us a hand, I would like the opportunity to pay it forward once everything gets resolved and the matters clear up. ( I don't drink or do anything illicit, just a guy who wishes things were back to normal again...) Thanks for taking the time to read this post.

t3_ii62n	1309965890.0	Rollout	Rollout	My new idea to further lower our chances of being scammed.	I already posted this in r/favors [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/ii5sc/we_need_a_little_programminghtml_help_over_in/) ...   While we still have far more being helped than the amount of scammers, it is getting annoying (understatement of the year) getting pm's, and mod messages constantly with suspected scammers (most are not).   My idea (in case you didn't want to click the favors link) is this:    verify ip's. We have a site we can host this on.  The idea is to have the requester of the pizza go to the site, enter their email address, the site auto grabs the ip, and gives the person a code. The person gives the code to the person who offers the pizza, and they can see the history of that ip address...  I think it should be simple, but I am not sure how to do it.  While we KNOW this will not deter all, it should take care of most....  If anyone here knows, please let me know, and write it up.   As always we welcome ideas, and feedback from the community.  Edit: we are also trying to implement unique browser hashes to the data ( please don't ask me exactly how this is done, that is why we recruited help), which will be harder to trick than the ip. Between the two we should have some positive results.	True

t3_ihr97	1309920773.0	enforce1	pizza	Thoughts about RAOP...	Hello everyone,  I fully support this subreddit's mission. At least for me, there are a few things that I'm looking for in a request, and I'd like to outline them here.   1) Reddit account age  It is a non starter for me to have an unestablished reddit account. I feel that this is a community to help people like us. And that whole "today you, tomorrow me" thing... I want to make sure that, in addition to helping fellow redditors, I'm also growing the community.   2) Details  The same as an AMA. If I don't get details, something, anything, I'm going to have a hard time knowing that you are legit. I don't want to buy pizza for a guy who just doesnt feel like spending money. That's against the spirit of what we are trying to do here. I'm not saying that you have to get into the nitty gritty... Just give us something!  3) Sense of entitlement gets old fast.   I don't owe you a pizza. Stop acting like a child.   Note: I don't mean this to sound like you have to dance for your supper. I understand that you have fallen on hard times, and I wouldn't be here if I didn't want help. But this pizza isn't free, it's an investment in your future, and an offering of hope. As corny and shitty as it sounds, ( and I don't want to speak for everyone ) but we are doing this to feel good, and help out a friend we haven't met yet. Meet us half way.   Sorry for the rant. Have a great night!

You guys are all awesome, it's funny to think how much a simple pizza can change a persons day. Due to my current financial situation, which admittedly is largely my own doing, I've been living off rice for the past week and a half just trying to keep food in my kitty's bowl. Once I turn things around I plan to come here and send some pizzas myself! That's how I'll know I'm turning my finances around :).  Sorry if this is a somewhat useless post, I really just wanted to say that you all are awesome. Little things like this let me know there's still hope for humanity.

t3_ig63z	1309757492.0	serenalunarose		REQUEST: A pizza would be wonderful - Las Vegas area.	My boyfriend and I are both college students who survive on financial aid. We have very little money to spend, and don't have the ability to eat out often. Though we are not in desperate need, a pizza would be a wonderful gift to brighten our spirits (and a nice change from pre-packaged food). It's hard to have your nose on the grindstone all of the time and not be able to go out for food or fun, but if there are people who need it more, please, help them!

t3_ieq05	1309574917.0	maragesic	shroom	Today is going really awfully, reddit.  (Austin, TX)	This morning, I went and pulled rent out of my bank account, leaving me with $2.78 and gave my landlord rent money as a money order. Here's [what my bank account looks like right now.](http://i.imgur.com/I3GA5.jpg)   I came home & a few hours later found a [notice from the landlord](http://i.imgur.com/Q85uW.jpg) that my husband hid from me that came last week, saying we owe over $200 for utilities the past few months (I didn't know we were that far behind because he deals with all of it), and that eviction could take place if we don't pay that $200 over. So I went back and gave them a check for that amount, which I know will overdraft my account severely.   My husband has been looking for work since he lost his last job, to no avail. His last long-term job ended with his factory shutting down and outsourcing his job. I've been doing everything I can to keep us afloat, but it's finally come down to a point where we haven't bought groceries in three weeks and we're still going to be short over $200 after that check goes through. I'm a full-time student, and I work odd jobs doing whatever I can to make ends meet right now while I try to finish my degree.   In my cabinet right now, I have instant mashed potatoes, some flour, and sugar. I've eaten potato cakes for the past few days.  And finally, the kicker... this is what really brought me to the point where I don't mind begging for charity. When I got back from my second run to the landlord, I found that my husband had given both of my pets to the pound. He didn't let me say goodbye, and he didn't even take a photo of them before he dropped them off. He knows I would have sold my computer and anything else remotely of value that I have in order to keep them fed and healthy. My house feels so lonely right now, and I can't stop crying as I think about what it's going to be like to never see them again.    I'm in Austin, TX, I prefer Pizza Hut but really anything would be great at this point. Preferred pizza toppings in include meat. Pretty much, whatever kind of meat. Veggies cause major tummy problems for me.

t3_ie9we	1309534464.0	rlaw68	pizza-gold	[FYI] e-giftcard system delays	Hi everyone -- I've noticed that the e-giftcard system used by all the major chains experiences system delays that are sometimes significant (6-8 hours). So sometimes it sends out a gift card 5 minutes after you buy it, sometimes quite a bit later. I just want people to be aware of this so that requesters understand that an offer made at 6 p.m. may not get a giftcard to you until the next morning. It's important to understand this so that people don't feel let down or that the person who made the offer isn't following through. I assume that some of the issue is that the e-giftcard folks sometimes want to do extra verification to make sure that someone who's ordering multiple giftcards is legit and not using a stolen credit card. Anyway, just wanted everyone to be aware.	
t3_ieh7s	1309550348.0	Givemepooh	shroom	Family time= Pizza Nite!!! 	I am new to this site today, so this is my first post. I read about this site online from a friend and she was so greatly blessed for pizza with her family, that I thought since were down and out too, maybe this will cheer us up. First off let me tell you about my family...I’m 26, married, and my husband and I have a daughter, she’s 15 months. In Feb 2010 right before my daughter was born, in march 10, my mother in law had a stroke. She never got feeling back in her right side and due to her disability she is living in a Rehabilitation nursing facility. She has 2 younger boys, now 14 and 16, and they are now living with us. We are in the process of getting custody of the boys and We receive no income for them. We do everything that we can to make sure these boys have food on the table, clothes to wear, just everything that we all need in our daily lives as well as us doing the same for our daughter.  These boys forced to live in shelters and there mother did the very minimal for them. We are trying to do the BEST possible to help these boys live life to the fullest. We live in Ohio and our town is having its Fair for the summer and we truly cannot afford for everyone to go and enjoy themselves, I know its just unhopeful circumstances right now but I just feel bad for the kids because I know how much they truly would enjoy it. I thought that since we cant afford to do that maybe if we could get some pizza, they could have some friends over and enjoy their Friday evening that way. This would make their night so much better. Thanks SOOOO much for even taking the time to read my post. Happy 4th of July weekend.

I lost my job, someone broke into my apartment, boyfriend lied about having lunch with another woman, and my dog pooped in the apartment.  Last one, although true, was to get a smile or laugh.  I've got a little bit of money, but barely enough to cover rent and utilities, and after having to change my locks and repair the damages done, I'll have very little breathing room.  I was really hoping to sit back and relax over the 4th of July weekend, but now I don't think I'll be able to.  Anyone willing to donate a pizza to a girl who is just looking for a break?

t3_idwr2	1309493129.0	Cacoo	pizza-gold	RAOP questions for a newbie	Hi all. I've been a lurker on Reddit for a bit now. I've come across these RAOP post here and there and they have really motivated me to try and do the same for someone else. I just have some questions on how to get started. As someone that is offering to purchase pizza for someone else, how do you typically go about doing so? Ask the requester for email address and try sending a gift card to their email address? Is this the 'best practice'/easiest way? Do you ask for actual address and where they would like the pizza from and call the pizza place yourself and place order over the phone? Sorry for the questions, but I get paid tomorrow from my job and am really eager to help out some other people that could use it, so would like to know how to best make a RAOP go as smooth as possible.  Thanks!!	True

There has been a lot of people helped, and the influx of users has brought just as many people giving as receiving. We love this!!!   There have been some concerns expressed about people scamming to get pizza. We really see that the mass majority of people are truly in need, but we know there are most likely some that are not. The nature of this whole thing is truly Random Acts of Pizza, meaning give it to whomever you want...   **If your intention is to give pizza to a person in need**, and you're concerned about the sincerity of the poster you are replying to, ask for proof of some kind, or ask for a phone number so you can call and talk to them. If someone is in true need, and you offer, they should be fine with going along with this.  This does not mean that you should not just offer a pie to someone who posts a request, it just means that if you want verification there is no shame in asking for it.  **Please help the mods help the new people** There are a lot of new people trying to figure out reddit, they don't know how to pm, or not post personal info for all to see. Some don't know how to post. I personally have sent hundreds (no exaggeration) of pm's on how to do stuff in the last couple days. If you see someone doing something wrong, or asking a question help please... It is why we are all here right? Help....  If there is a scammer please report them to us. I hope their karma bites them in the ass, but we will as well....   **Finally**, your mods are spending a lot of time on this. It is a labor of love. Once in a while we could use a pizza as well :) I know that I would not say no. I am on an apprentice wage after struggling with my past occupation due to economic times. I am living in a crap rental house, with about 20 bucks to my name for the next week, with a family of three (no joke). I know Gadianton would not say no, as he has huge financial issues as well. Not really sure about snang, still getting to know him, but I am sure that he would at least appreciate the offer.  Our being able to relate to hard times is what brought us together to make this happen.   We love that the community is growing, lets all try to keep it strong, and thriving.

t3_idmtx	1309469478.0	maxadine		(Request) ohio family	I have just been opened up to this great site. I feel that I have so much I could offer to others and it seems that it's a coincidence that there are people offering pizzas for others. My step children are spending the summer with us and as much as I love to cook, I can only stretch a dollar so far. After weeks of eating homemade dishes the children have been begging for pizza (their mother takes them out to eat fast food more than not) but we simply can't afford it for all of them (4 kids total with one on the way) on one salary (i am in my last trimester of pregnancy) while paying support through these summer months and not receiving any assistance. I feel so badly that they keep asking to go out and I have to always say no. Times are tough now, and with the price of gas, it has really dug out all extra fun cash for these little guys. As parents, we know that it is time to penny pinch and cut corners (even making laundry soap helps) but the kids just don't understand. I am not sure how this site works, where I would post something to offer, or to ask for help in giving my children a fun pizza night, but this seemed like a good start. We are in Ohio, 30 minutes north-west of dayton. Thank you to all of you that are helping others :) this seems like a great place for hope.

t3_idljj	1309466949.0	Elleyena	PIF	(Request) Athens, GA - College student in a bind - will pay forward	EDIT: CayucosKid was kind enough to buy me a couple pizzas, they just showed up and not only taste amazing, but will feed me for the rest of the weekend. Thank you so much.  So, my roommate had told me about this Reddit, and I had planned to keep it in mind to give other people pizza every once in a while. I wasn't planning on using this for me...but I'm in a really tough situation right now.  A little background: I had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when I lost my dining hall job. I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is "always hiring" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food. I've been surviving off the kindness of my landlord/roommates, (I do dishes I don't have to pay for food) but that can only go so far. I'm attempting to go back to school so I don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven't been getting the best hours.  According to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it's probably on it's last legs, and today I didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so I don't get any bonuses. Overall everything's just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I'll be able to cover everything then. It's just been a really rough day and I could use a meal that I didn't have to cook myself today.	True

Help	About a year and a half ago, I was involved in a wreck that almost took my life.(I will supply a picture to whoever can help me) Because of that, I have doctors bills from MRI's on my back and neck and physical therapy on my back because I tore muscle away from my spine and destroyed nerves. They have had no luck in fixing my back. Now I had to move out of my parents house because the fighting that ensued because I failed my college classes due to the short term memory loss from my wreck. Now with it being right around the first all my bills are due, my boyfriend is working as many hours as he can to help me out. We just adopted a dog from the shelter because she was going to get put to sleep because she was shy(she was an abused dog, now since we got her, she is the happiest dog ever). We haven't had delicious pizza in forever (which is hard because we live right down the street from pizza hut). I am asking just for one pizza,for us to eat tonight. That would just make my day and it would be amazing to surprise my boyfriend because we actually get to see each other tonight instead of me being asleep when he got home.

We were paying rent but the landlord was not paying the mortgage. As a result we had no where to go. We ended up having to stay in a motel untill we can find a new place. After the room is paid for the week and the car is gassed up so My fiancee can go to work just to pay for this room, There is close to nothing left. I have found work recently, but do not start for another 3 weeks. We basically live off of what food will fit in a mini- fridge.

Although I have been unemployed for almost 1 and a half years now, and would like Pizza myself, this request is not for me... It is for my ex-wife & my kids. She works and is a good mother, and she was only paying day care for the 5yo, but now that school is out, the day care expense has doubled due to the 11yo being there too. Even knowing that I am unemployed, I still pay the full child support (which comes directly out of my unemployment payment), never had it reduced. Well... she is having a real hard time right now, not only because of the doubled day care... she has a new postal person who has royally screwed the mail up.... which caused her not received her payment from the state yet. This is causing her rent to be late, and leaves her with hardly anything for food. I wouldn't might giving her more "cash" to help.. but I have less money then she does ! Even tho my ex and I get along great.. this is not for her.... I want to do this for the kids... They deserve much better them Ramen Noodles & Canned Paste ! Both kids would be happy with just plain old Cheese & Sausage Pizza... they have a Pizza Hut real close to their apartment, and it is also the closest "name brand" Pizza joint near me too. I will have them for a week this week so pizza for us would be great too.  Thanks in advance....  God Bless everyone on this site !

One of the worst sides effects at that point is a nauseous taste in the back of my throat and strong tastes help me cope.

I saw the post about the ABC coverage of this subreddit, and I came poking around. Saw someone offering to buy pizza for a college kid taking summer classes and I thought...wait a second...that's me!  Basically I'm taking summer classes to graduate in four years with a double major. Just got home from my hour long commute from the big city back to the middle of nowhere tiny town, and found out that since all of my siblings except for me are gone for the summer, my parents decided that meant they didn't need to cook or buy food anymore (they went out to eat before I got home and didn't bring back leftovers).  Fridge is empty, and I still haven't had dinner cause I'm too poor with commuting and gas money. :(  But then I realized something. I didn't want to ask, because there were already two people on there who were in worse situations than me. And it made me happier to know that one of them was getting the warm gooey deliciousness that is pizza than to ask for myself. I'll go eat some back of the cupboard stragglers, and I'll survive.  As soon as I get my next paycheck, I am definitely going to buy someone a random pizza.   Anyway, I think the point I'm trying to make is: thank you guys for existing, and don't freak out about all the new people coming! This is an awesome idea and I think the media coverage will be a blessing in the long run.   Enjoy your pizza goodness, and I'll see you in a few weeks when I get to be the benevolent Pizza God! :) 	
t3_ictp4	1309396976.0	damnyousave		Pizza Request...	So this isn't quite the usual post but me and my friends broke out the old N64 tonight and were playing some Harvest Moon, we had gotten as far as building the second story to our house when my N64 shut off!! and now it won't even boot back up... we're totally bummed out, and if any of you guys know how we feel, we'd love a pizza right now. Thanks in advance	
t3_ictmh	1309396809.0	scott-42	pizza	Thank you Austin's Pizza you made several people happy.	I volunteered to pick up and deliver some pizzas to some homeless folks in need in another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/iajqv/offer_austin_tx/). I bought a case of water to go along with the pizzas and brought my daughter along to teach her about helping others that have more need than us.  Here are a couple pictures of the homeless folks getting some pizza and water from the tailgate of my truck as my daughter watches. http://imgur.com/a/tINFP  Special thanks to [Austin's Pizza](http://austinspizza.com/) for providing some free pizza to those in need.	
t3_icsn3	1309394544.0	Jaredmmye		A friend working 2 jobs, and only 19 for his family, they could use some help.	A friend of mine has two jobs currently, and works to support his family. His mother teaches, and his father is in California living in their grandmother's home because she was recently deceased. I help them at times, and even offer for work on their cars if they ever need it. I try to pay for some things for him when we hang out as friends, but they live just confined, and without much A/C. And living here in Arizona, it's already hitting 110 degrees Fahrenheit. They can't run much for the A/C, or electronics, they live a bit...restricted.   I don't expect much from this request, but I recently found out about this site. The thought came to me put in a request, why not I have the free time, and it could help him. If you've read this far, I appreciate that you took the time to read this post, and story of a sort. If you would like to help him, like I do, just send me an E-mail, my E-mail address is "jaredmmye@yahoo.com". You can ask me anything about him, within reason of course ha ha. I would appreciate you helping him, and I'm sure his family would forever be grateful.   Thank you again for your time,

What info can redditors provide to make it easier for potential givers? We already supply info about the number of people and the general location - what about contact info for local pizza places, topping preferences, deals we're aware of, etc.?  Could we create a document to help first-time givers through the process of ordering for another person, including "how to pay without a credit card" and other topics?  Anything else you guys can think of? What would make it easier for you to give / receive your RAOP gifts?  Also, how do mods feel about adding the potential for fast food gifts, such as MySonic cards, McDonald's cards, Burger King, etc.? Those would require the recipient to have transportation though.

I'd like to say by the grace of God today there is food in the fridge thanks to food stamps.  But there were definitely times where a pizza would have lifted my spirits, and the fact that there are people here doing just that for others, you are all amazing.

This one in particular is the original (from what I know) and with the homeless people who tend to congregate near by this shop and Port Authority, every time I always see someone who will buy a slice for someone else.  I saw the ABC thing and thought I would post this info. For anyone in NY I am sure you see 99cent pizza around so you know its a good way to share random pizza if you choose.  For non-NYers either call, or come check this place out of something. Though there are better, nothing can beat 2 slices and a drink for $2.75.

t3_icbf1	1309357806.0	mj052506		Request - Alexandria, VA - Mom of 2 Would Love to Bring Back Pizza Night this Friday	Hi all. I heard about this site on the radio, and I thought it was the nicest idea. I have been on both sides of this. Able to give, and in need. We were doing ok until my boyfriend lost his job this past March. Which is fabulous since around the same time we found out we were pregnant with our third child. So he has been pounding the pavement trying to find a new job, and in the meantime my salary gets stretched pretty thin. We use to have pizza night on Friday with the kids. We'd get a movie from the Redbox, enjoy a pizza pie and have a fun family night. Its amazing how you miss simple things like that. I hope we are soon in a position again where we can give more, and need for less. Heck, I hope we all are. Times are just hard, jobs are scarce and I just hope things get better for everyone. But if you are in the position to provide pizza night for a grateful family, it would mean a lot. Maybe show the kids that yes, money is tight...but not everything is changing. Things are going to be okay. And I will surely pay it forward. Thanks for reading :)	
t3_icah7	1309355647.0	Qzy		I just bought a homeless man a subway	Hi reddit,  I just got home from my university in Copenhagen, and wanted to give thanks to this subreddit.   Lately I wanted to send a pizza over reddit to someone in need, but it's hard to find who REALLY needs it.  I rarely see homeless people in Denmark, due to government financial support and government shelters, etc. But sometimes I do see some unlucky people - some enters the trains at busy hours asking for money, others sits quietly and embarrassed waiting for people to notice them. I've never given money to homeless who enters trains - it feels forced and back in my head I still have the voice saying "Who knows what they really use the money for?" - I think a lot of us have that voice in our head, to make sure we aren't being taken advantage of.  But! Since I started reading this subreddit I thought it might be a good idea to buy some food instead and find someone who I can see needs it. I left the train in Nørreport and sure enough there were a man of age 60(?) sitting on a small chair, selling a monthly "homeless magazine" (Don't ask me what the name of it is, but it does exist!). I walked 300 meters to the nearest Subway and got us both a subway menu (ice cold water, sandwich and an apple), got back, sat down and asked him if he was hungry - he nodded yes and I handed him his menu and wished him a great day.   Never have I seen a person's eyes light up that much. And I've never felt so good, walking away from there.  What's up next? Next time I go to my university again, I'll see if there's anyone in the area who needs a "random act of pizza" (or subway, sorry for breaking the rules!), and this time I'll stay and eat with the person. Who wouldn't want company?  Now, this isn't a "you should do this to feel good about yourself"-thread, or "do this, or you are a bad person!"... What I hope you get from this is simply do it - buy a 10$ pizza, or subway, and make someones day so much better.  Thanks for reading.

A lot of them are for printed coupons, which is normally not what this subreddit needs, and some of the coupons just suck.  Here's the best deal I've ever run across online.  Go to Domino's website and order two 1 topping large pizzas.  Type in the deal "EBFP" in the coupon code box and it gets you a buy one get one free.  Then, IN ADDITION, type in EBCS in the coupon box and it lets you double-stack coupons and add a free Cinna-Stix as well.    I have used this coupon for months in Atlanta, Ga and it comes to about 10 dollars for two large 1-topping pizzas and an order of CinnaStix.  Best deal I've found, and I suspect/hope it will work in many locations around the USA.  If you have any great deals for online codes, please share them!  We'd all like to give as much pizza/happiness as we can for our money!

t3_ic932	1309351865.0	Pottifar	pizza	What I thought would happen with much media coverage (and lets not be paranoid)	So there has been a [discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ic33g/dear_redditors_of_trees_if_you_have_enough_money/) about Redditors from r/trees coming here asking for pizza without actually needing it.  In addition RAOP has recieved much coverage in the media, which in turn has led to a ton of requests.   Dear RAOP, please do not turn into [spartans defending the narrow pass from the hordes of freeloading people who lie to get a free pizza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHxIssSROjk).   When you see alot of requests it is easy to get paranoid and start to think that EVERYONE IS OUT TO GET US. But I take a look on the "New" section, and [this](http://imgur.com/LeuTP) is what I see - mostly offers, even a software company giving away 40+ pizzas.  That makes it possible, atleast for me, to still believe in this subreddit, even after it grows.	
t3_ic8zs	1309351556.0	fuwath		I would just like to say thank you, Reddit.	I come from a low income family and I just recently graduated from a 4-year post high school educational institute. There had been many times where I didn't know how I was going to feed my girlfriend, pets and I, so I know how a free pizza some days would mean the absolute world to me. I'm doing better now so I'm not asking for anything for myself.  I would just like to thank you Reddit, for being classy. When the world is going to hell and people are starving, you continue to prove that there are decent people left on this rock we call Earth. Keep up the great work and may plenty of karma be sent your way.  Kudos to everybody!

Of course, I am not hurt enough for disability, so my wife and I will live off of unemployment.Any type of help is greatly appreciated. Thank you

t3_ic51a	1309336421.0	IncogMotion		Warning to all who offer to buy others pizza!	I've lurked this board for awhile now, because I find alot of joy in seeing people in need get helped. I'm posting this because I've myself, caught people trying to swindle pizza just because it's become an option on this board, and I've seen others complaining. Not to be rude, or anything but the publicity ROAP has been getting, ie. on TV & CNN is probably the worst thing for this board, it's opened a public window for people to trickle into this sub-reddit, in hopes to get 'free' pizza, which is actually taking away from people in need. I found this board myself on the front page of reddit one day and have been lurking ever since, but in the last week or so I've found an alarming rate of people who aren't in need at all, people who pay for things on a regular basis(based on their history) and still have zero shame in asking people to buy them pizza. My reason for posting this, and I know it really isn't my business, is to let other redditors know to take the time to look through these peoples history and see if they are truly in need, or someone who has no moral regard. Don't spend your hard earned money on people who aren't in need. You people who donate pizzas are truly great people, don't let the intentions of this board get taken advantage of.   Hope this post isn't against the rules mods, if it is please let me know and I'll remove it or post in the proper place?

t3_ic4ir	1309334525.0	worldsbestuser		Not in need of pizza, just wanted to share my thoughts..	This is fucking great.  Seriously, humans helping humans is one of the coolest things to witness firsthand, and this subreddit has made that absolutely 100% possible.  Forget Titanic, the notebook, blah blah blah whatever your favourite emotional movie is, this is the real deal.  If you post on this subreddit with bullshit about how you need pizza, you are a piece of shit.  To the rest of you, pizza givers and receivers, god bless you and keep up the good work! Amazing stuff to witness in this modern era, as cliche as that sounds.

Tough Times America...	broke, scared, close to homeless artist in the southbay of LA who used to work in housing industry, can't find a job, could use a pizza (or an art patron cuz i actually am talented and have shown in galleries in years long past). made a pot of watery potato soup, but that doesn't last long, although i can't complain as it was something in the belly.  never ever thought i would be a statistic in this down economy...I am days away from gas and electricity being shut off, not to mention being clueless where next months rent is coming from. I am embarrassed as heck, cuz i never ever thought this would be me. I am a hard worker, willing to pull my weight. I haven't even been able to afford the gas back up to NorCal to see my 12 year old son in a year. ashamed. am handing out biz cards everywhere, applying on craigslist, going door to door, but this is tough...am i still in america? I've always felt that art should be for all people, and maybe one way i could pay this forward is to trade drawings (mostly abstract) for food, utilities help, etc...(you never know, back in 1900's Paris artists would routinely trade drawings for food and some of those artist drawings turned out to be worth a lot of money one day).  anyway, humbly, bless anyone reading this...hard to believe I am even writing it, as I never thought this would be part of life's journey...hanging in there...

t3_ic20x	1309327071.0	Rick26FLA		26 Unemployed... Broke Down Car... Stuck in  Tampa Florida Area...  Confused...  Hungry...	Hello everyone.  I really don't like asking for help but Iam really down right now and desperate.  My name is Rick.  Iam 26 and from Pittsburgh, PA.  Due to the poor job market in Pittsburgh as well as the lack of family and friends willing to help, I recently packed up my car and headed to Florida looking for a fresh start.  My bank account is negative and my only source of money is my sports memorabilia collection which I have been trying to sell to dealers in the Tampa area.  So far, I've had no luck.  I have been submitting job applications for the past 2 weeks and so far have had no takers. :(  Last Friday while on my way to submit a job application at the gas station down the street my car started shaking real bad and died in the middle of an intersection.  I had $9 in my pocket and had no clue how I or the car was getting home.  After sitting in the middle of the road for almost an hour a tow truck driver finally pulled up and asked if I need help.  I explained that all I had was $9 to my name and how it seemed everything that could go wrong in my life is.  The guy told me he has been there before and agreed to tow me on the house being that I was less than 2 miles from my house.  I never even got to ask his name.  Thank You again tho.  My car blowing up was crushing.  I have been laying around the house for 4 days trying to figure out what to do.  Yesterday, I cleaned out my car and put all of my spare change into a zip lock bag and walked to Publix to hopefully buy something to eat for a few days.  $11 does not buy much.  I bought some beans, hot dogs, crackers, peanut butter, and some bread.  Needless to say I prob will not survive long on that.  I have a $775 rent payment due July 12th, a broken down car, empty fridge, negative bank account, insurance cancellation letters, and what seems like a million things on my mind.  I havent even been able to sleep at night because I have so many things to worry about.  I don't drink, smoke, or do any kind of drugs.  Iam a good kid.  I have worked since I was 16 and recently ran into a patch of bad luck.  If there is anyone out there into signed sports memorabilia, I would gladly trade you some merchandise for some food.  In addition, if there are any business owners near me who are hiring, I can work any shift 7 days a week.  There is a Pizza Hut within a mile of my house so if anyone out there is willing to buy me some lunch/dinner 2moro I promise to one day repay you.  Thank you in advance.  -Rick

Hi, I just heard about this on ABC news, and I understand how some of you might be skeptical of new users based on what I've read on the forum.  I am 32 years old and I attend undergraduate school at University of Arizona in Tucson. I have two young boys (6 and 8) and my husband can now longer work due to peripheral neuropathy and arthritis in his hands (he's 48).  He gets an SSI check, and we use my student grants, loans and scholarships to live on, however right now the money is real tight, especially due to the fact that we are experiencing record heat, our highs have been 105+ for a week and our last electric bill was nearly $200.  IT HAS NEVER been that high before.  We have been utilizing the local food banks, but there are just so many ways to prepare beans, rice and canned vegi's.    Thank you all for reading this, and in August, when I have surplus, I will pass the good deed forward to someone else who is struggling to feed their family when I get my student grants, loans and scholarships in mid-August.   God Bless you and have a Great day.   We are Located in Tucson, AZ.  Thanks again and god bless. 	True

t3_ibpiw	1309298576.0	crewchief775	pizza	Thank you RAOP	Today I read an article about RAOP and was interested.  At first, I'll admit that the idea seemed a little weird.  After all, how much can it help someone by simply sending them a pizza?  When I started reading the posts and noticing how many people had sent pizzas, I realized I had stumbled upon something terrific.  Maybe a single pizza isn't a permanent fix to anyone's problems, but it can certainly solve hunger for a night and bring together a family that is down on their luck.  It is nice to see a community of people dedicated to making this world a better place.  I am a believer in God and feel that this is the way he intended for us to be towards one another and it makes me smile to see it happening.  RAOP, I thank you for giving my wife and I the opportunity to give a family a pizza today!

I have attempted, through different companies, to purchase "E Gift Cards" for people here at ROAP. It seems that the majority of the pizza companies decided to go through the same company that is now refusing to take these cards. (I have tried 3 of my own, none are working even though I have the credit/cash required and then some.)   I am in contact with Domino's at the moment trying to resolve the issue- has any one else run into being rejected? If so, is there a way around these people?

t3_ibfb7	1309279180.0	navygirl31	shroom	Prior military and family of 7 that lost our jobs and struggling	I don't normally do this as I am the one helping others out, but I originally was discharged from the military with a medical discharge and then last year my husband left his job in another state to move here and marry me.  I had since obtained a great job as I have several college degrees but due to budget cuts and the economy, I lost it. Since, we couldn't afford our apartment and had to move.  I do have 2 jobs but they are both minimum wage.  It is very humbling to go from my life before to struggling.  My husband is a preacher as well and we are trying to get a ministry together to help others heal spiritually.  Our 3 boys are sharing a small room and the 2 girls share a room.  My husband has rigged our bed to work or we would be sleeping on the floor.  We have tremendous faith in God and even if no one chooses to help us have a "pizza night", it is okay because we are under the blessing of God and he always comes through.  We have been hunting for jobs but the economy in our state is terrible, which leaves us in a precarious position.  Our kids never whine when we have peanut butter and jelly every day for lunch and ramen noodles as those are cheap.  We do have chicken and vegetables and eat really healthy as a family but sometimes it is nice to have a "treat".  I appreciate anything anyone can do and I will repay this back through doing for someone else when we get on our feet again.

You can only purchase them with a US address and can only use them from the US.  I'm pretty sure of this, but feel free to correct me.  * If this is your first time purchasing, you may be asked to verify through CashStar (the gift card processing company)  * You will get emails for each stage of processing your order.  * Orders can take anywhere from 10 minutes to overnight (The longest I've personally experienced is 2 hours).  If it's during their customer service hours, you may be able to contact a customer service agent to get your order expedited if it's taking too long.  *International Gifting Notes:*  *  It is possible to gift out of country, there have been several success stories.  In my case, I called up the pizza place in Canada and asked them if I could gift to a friend and they said, "As long as you give me your permission to charge your card right now, then we're all set."  In my case, this place was Pizza Pizza in Canada.  There have been other success stories of placing online orders at the websites of other countries too.  When in doubt, just call up the pizza place.  Also, a lot of local joints are happy to work with you, too.    * [Just-Eat](http://www.just-eat.ca/) is a great choice for gifting to Canada, too.  Thanks Amaya69!  Anything else experienced gifters feel should be added, comment below and I will edit this post!  edit: Rollout's point on international gifting.  edit2: Adding Amaya69's Canada tip!

Just stretch it out with clean fingers. Put it on the top rack of the 110 degree F oven for the *third rise* (5 minutes work, 1 hour wait)  **Toppings Boss**  A base of pizza sauce: can, squeeze bottle or *even homemade*  Your toppings: howabout a classic: veggie with onion, green pepper, olives, tomatoes.  Slice and or dice those things.  Top with you cheese: Mozzaralla at least.  $5 or $6 to cover a 16" pizza.  Feta cheese might be awesome too.  15 minutes work or play depending on how you roll.  **Now get baked.**  Bake on the top rack at 500 degrees F for 13 to 15 minutes.  Vent some moisture.  And remember: you can cook it more, but you can't cook it less.  And don't use your 16" pizza pan as a cutting board or serving tray!

She considers herself lucky that she gets a pension even though her deceased partner was a war vet. she goes on holidays each year. she goes without tv, mobile, (that weird internet stuff), alcohol, tomatoes when they're expensive, milk when it's too dear and other food. her "need" is her holiday. relax a bit, dont give attention to the porno weirdo's or their detractors. dont give pizza if you dont want, do give if you want...just relax!

I want to give the glory of the gift of pizza, but I want to make sure it actually goes to someone in need. Would a scale based on how dire your situation is be a good idea? <10> if you haven't eaten in a while and have no money to spare, <1> if you're running low on food and can't get anything in the foreseeable future? Just an idea. We can have it so that the user must have been a redditor for at least a while before submitting a <10> to weed out any hoaxes, or something along those lines

I recently found that Papa John's do a 10-inch pizza for just £3 (was £2, which was awesome) if you order in-store on a weekday between noon and 5 pm. Ask for the lunchtime special. That's a full, hot, high quality meal right there.  Hope someone benefits from this. Enjoy.

t3_i7ksm	1308868046.0	Shmafty	pizza	Has anyone successfully been able to send a pizza to Europe from North America?	It seems that our American friends are able to receive pizza assistance with little difficulty, and that's awesome. But it would also appear that we have a lot of hungry Europeans that sometimes don't get as many responses. I'm sure that there are people like me that wouldn't mind sending a pizza across the pond, but just don't know how (like me)!  In the "suggestions and tips" thread on the sidebar, Rollout mentions that a UK redditor has been able to send a pizza to the US, and that it should be feasible to send pizzas to other countries, so I'm hoping that someone that has bought a pizza from North America in Europe could clear up some issues.  For example:  1) I visited the UK versions of popular pizza chain websites like Domino's and Papa John's, but could not find any way to purchase a eGift card from those sites. Is this not possible in the UK? I wouldn't think that the US eGift cards to those chains would work, but maybe they might? I don't know. (The closest thing I found was that you could order a gift card for Pizza Express and they would snail mail it to you).  2) This may seem like a stupid question, but I honestly don't know: If you call up a pizzeria or use online ordering, will they allow you to use an American Credit card? Morgan Freeman tells me all the time that Visa can be used all over the world, but I've never tried beyond Canada. And even if it's technically possible, I don't know if they would get suspicious if they ask to verify my post code and I respond with five numbers and no letters.  3) Should we just call up a pizza place and be honest with them? Saying something like, "Hey, I'm calling from the states and I'd like to buy my mate a pizza." I don't know how well that would go over.  So if you have been able to successfully send a pizza or gift card to Europe from North America, would you kindly post and let us know how you went about it, and how it worked out? Lots of thanks in advance!

t3_i6ihq	1308774367.0	RRSignalMaintainer	shroom	{Request} Wrecked my car last weekend while up north, spent the last of my money paying a deposit for a rental car.  Eating toast two days in a row is getting old...  In West Michigan. 	All I have at home is a loaf of bread, since I was on vacation when the accident happened (as typical in Michigan, a deer decided to do a few cartwheels over the two-week old car).  Luckily insurance is covering the car, but since I don't have a credit/debit card, I had to pay the deposit in cash, depleting all my money until Friday when I get paid again. To make matters worse, the rental car they gave me is a baby blue Nissan Versa, which is embarrassing as hell to drive.  I am in Grand Haven, MI and was wondering if there was any way I could get just a basic pepperoni pizza.  The only chain places are Jets, Pizza Hut, and Dominoes (and Dominoes last I knew used one of those carbon copy things the driver carried for the CC since they demand the person with the card to be here).  I WILL pay it forward after I get paid on Friday.  I am just slightly sick of having toast and butter the past two days...	True

Let me tell you what our goal is and ultimately what exactly is going on. Please Read.  On June 30th, July 1st, and July 2nd, a group of ~10 High School Students will be playing through a list of PC games that we have put together. We will be LIVE STREAMING THE ENTIRE EVENT and making sure that it is entertaining for the viewers the whole time. The event in it's entirety will take 60 hours in an attempt to raise money for charity. We will be facing sleep deprivation and hours upon hours of assorted varieties of games (Strategy, RPG, Indie Games, Adventure Games, ETC...) Come join the fun! The live stream will be found at http://www.ustream.tv/ at around 12:00 Pm Pacific Time. An official link will be posted here at the beginning of the even when we introduce ourselves.  What charity, you ask? Why none other than the "Random Acts Of Pizza" Sub-reddit that gives pizza to people in need, whether they're poor or just down on their luck. We'd be asking for at least $300 total in donations. Even if we only get half that much it can still make a huge difference for someone who is facing hard times and genuinely needs it. Feel free to head on over to www.reddit.com/r/Randon_Acts_Of_Pizza and check it out. Maybe read a few stories. Our Reddit Account will be advertising for this event starting June 20th.  This is a CHARITY organization, so 100% of the profits will be given to the hungry directly after the event has ended.  Feel free to Friend this account to keep up to date.   Every penny will count. Thank you again, and mark it on your calendar! It will be a Lot of fun! :)  The donation page can be found here: http://randomactsofpizzacharity.chipin.com/charity-event-randomactsofpizza  Tim Troppoli and the rest of the [Extralives](http://extralives.org/) crew inspired us, so please check them out as well!

I was in Philly and missed my bus home by less than a minute.  My only option was taking a train to my friends and staying there tonight and paying him to drive me home tomorrow.  thing is we are both really broke and the last 10 dollars I have is going into his gas tank.  I had some spaghetti and meat sauce at my house but since I can't get there until tomorrow I'm gonna be hungry tonight.    Obviously I'm not starving or anything and I've gone a day without eating before but man a pizza would be awesome.  Would probably make my friend think I was some sort of internet wizard too.    It'd have to be soon because they will close soon I'm sure.  I can give an address and such if anyone wants to.

I live in one of the most expensive places on the face of the planet, Whistler, BC.  Up until this year there has been tons of work available here.  I was getting paid more money two summers ago as an unskilled labourer on a construction site than my friends with degrees and good jobs were making.  It's not like that anymore.    I have an awesome job, but it's only seasonal.  I got laid off at the beginning of February and the seasonal job doesn't start again until mid-Octobre.  There's is absolutely no work available here!  I've applied for maybe 15 jobs, all very low paying (rent here is ridiculous...need to make $13/hr just to cover rent/electricity), and have only had two interviews.  The first one, to be honest, didn't go so well.  I wasn't surprised that I didn't get it.  I had an interview for a job yesterday as a night time maintenance helper at a hotel, and that interview went pretty good.  Fingers crossed that I get it, even though the hours are 10pm to 8am.   My unemployment benefits run out next week, so if I don't get this one, I might be royally screwed...but if I do get it, I'll for sure help somebody else out with a pizza or two!

This community is everything, and more, that Gadianton, and I have dreamed of.....   As a lot of you know I have been talking to pizza chains, and CashStar. I have been trying to strike deals with them to make all of our lives easier. So far there has been only a little response, and looking like it will happen, but not going really fast. We hoping this is about to change......read on....  In the past couple days we have done a few interviews with larger news networks. We will reveal the links when the articles are published (should be this coming week).  This will increase our numbers for sure, and could encourage CashStar, and some of the pizza chains, to get on board with us.   So far in this community everyone has done great in sorting the needs, from the ones that don't need. We know it will continue like that.     ** Regarding New accounts**: A new account can be a person in need just as much as an account that has been around for 5 years. If you feel more comfortable in asking the person to provide proof of some kind do so, preferably in private. Please always suggest that they pizza it forward when they can.  While we know a few may try to abuse this system, not many will. We already know that CashStar will let you know if you are trying to give to someone who has received a couple pizza gift cards already.   **---------**  There has been some suggestion lately to bring back the down arrow. I removed it originally due to seeing every post downvoted, sometimes multiple times. The community knows how to downvote if needed, and thus far it seems to have been working great. In my opinion it would be a bad idea to bring it back, but if enough of the community disagrees with me the arrow will reappear.    It has been suggested that we possibly do a pool of pizza cards to be given away when our subscribers hit 5000. Thoughts on this?   Thoughts, and suggestions, as we are about to grow even more in numbers? 	True

It really bums me out, because he's always been poor and has worked tooth and nail to get to where he is now (working several jobs, his girlfriend as well). They just got engaged last Christmas, but things have been rocky since he lost his job and she lost one of hers (long story, but really, just freak reasons as to why it happened).   Reddit, can you help me cheer them up? I don't have the funds right now, because I'm getting screwed by hospital bills that I didn't have insurance for (long story too, haha) and I'm just a server working part time at the moment. Would someone be willing to send him some love-pizza? :)   **EDIT: We live in Kentucky!** And tomorrow would be ideal, haha, not tonight. It's obviously quite late here. I'm gonna check this in a few hours before my morning shift, and PM his address to any kind soul who would like it. :)  **EDIT 2:** svlad hooked him up! Thanks man! :D	True

I was expecting to get some money by the end of this month for playing a gig but that got canceled, so all i been eating lately is oranges and boiled potatoes with butter and soy sauce, a pizza would surely make my heart explode.

My husband just got paid today, he was short on work the past week and earned only $300. We basically live paycheck to paycheck, and week by week put however much money is needed for certain bills aside. Well this week we need to put $300 aside for rent. I am not really certain what to do. Can't put that aside because then we wouldn't even have money for gas and things like that. I would hope we could make it up with next weeks check, but what happens if work runs short again? This has been happening for about a month now. Our pantry/fridge isn't completely empty, we've got staple things like bread/milk/eggs/cheese. But I am getting so tired of eating grilled cheese sandwiches..no matter how good they may be sometimes.  Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'd be happy to pay it forward when we've got more money.

A couple of nights ago I created [a post asking for some pizza for the night](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/i0iv6/request_feed_my_family_for_a_night/). Our benefactor asked that I post pics of us enjoying the pizza, and that I pay it forward.  Well, I found out today that a check I've been waiting on FOR TWO MONTHS will FINALLY arrive in a few days - so paying it forward will happen ASAP.   And here are [pictures of happy babies with pizza](http://imgur.com/a/YTpMm#RUlIQ)! We were even able to share a little with our in-laws, who threw in a few dollars for pop.  As an aside, I was surprised how much pizza we could get with a $30 gift card at Papa John's. We used a coupon for two pizzas for $21, and added cheese bread and a dessert. We covered the extra $1.80 with pocket change.   My oldest son literally threw himself into bed with the announcement "I'm stuffed! I don't even want to LOOK at pizza, or I'm going to blow up!"  So yes. [View these happy babies](http://imgur.com/a/YTpMm#RUlIQ) and revel in the knowledge that your kindness has helped them get pizza when, otherwise, their dinner would have been peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

t3_i004a	1308109007.0	edify	GREEN	[FYI] Papa John's eGift Card's require phone verification.	I tried to get [texpundit](/user/texpundit) a pizza [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/hzsdy/dead_broke_until_money_transfer_goes_through/) earlier today.  After a long nap, I woke up and asked tex if he had received his pizza yet. He informed me that he had yet to receive an email with his gift card number. I went to check my email and apparently Papa Johns uses a secondary company called CashStar that requires phone verification to approve first time eGift Card purchases. [Here's the email I got](http://i.imgur.com/gZ85T.jpg).  I just approved his eGift Card over the phone, but it is too late for him to order. He ate some of the pasta he mentioned in his post.  **Edit:** From the input I've received, it appears that CashStar customer service is very familiar with [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza). That is awesome. This community has made quite the impact.  **TL;DR** If you are filling a request or offering a pizza, Papa Johns requires phone verification via a 1-800 number after you order the eGift Card. It's easy to do.  Sorry tex!	True

t3_hz6tu	1308031562.0	gdit_saint		Dear Random Acts Of Pizza	I joined here back when there were less than 50 subscribers. I figured it would be a long-shot for this subreddit to take off. For a long time, I was giving pizza via r/assistance. Here as I type, there are over 3,500 subscribers and a well organized subreddit.   Thank you to our mods who have worked hard to get this subreddit to where it is today, but most of all, thank you to all of those who are doing the giving. I think most of us don't realize how lucky we are simply just because we are able to eat, what we'd like, when we're hungry - I know I did.   Thanks guys <3	
t3_hz3ge	1308022435.0	gill_outean		Problem sending pizzas to Canadians? Use e-mail Interac!	Tonight, my generous donator sent me money for pizza via e-mail Interac transfer. In case you haven't used it before, it's very simple and secure. You log into your online banking, set up the transfer (amount, recipient's email address, etc.), set a password and send it. The recipient gets an email with a link that takes them to their online banking page. They fill in the password, choose an account for the money to be put into and voila!  There are two pitfalls, mind you:  1) You have to have an account with a major bank (CIBC, TD, BMO, etc.)  2) The money is just that - *money*. It's not a eGift Card, so you can't guarantee that the funds are going towards food for the recipient. This is just one of those situations where you need to believe in the inherent good in others, I suppose!  Despite the cons, this is a quick, safe, easy way to do the same thing our friends to the south have been doing for one another with eGift Cards. It worked well for me, that's for sure!   	
t3_hz1m5	1308017876.0	sarahxxxsora		(Request) Could anyone send my hungry boyfriend something? I feel weird asking...but I was told to ask here..:]	My boyfriend, Kyle, is a very sweet guy. He recently moved in with some relatives (so he could be closer to me!), but they are having financial troubles, and in consequence do not have any food in their fridge, or cabinets. They usually are gone, and he feels bad asking for money/food.  I am a poor college student, and barely am able to afford my living expenses. But right now he is looking for a job (very diligently), and hasn't found one yet. He tells me every night that its "okay" 'cause he's living closer to me now, or that "I could stand to lose a few pounds". But this just makes me sad. He lives in Bellingham, Washington. If you are able/willing enough, post here/message me. It would make his (and my) day...maybe our week? If I can do anything in return, let me know.

t3_hw1f8	1307671665.0	Rollout	Rollout	Well good news, and bad news comes in bundles I guess.....	** EDIT : The redditor that is in question has answered to this, and while he did ask twice in need(rather spread the love here, not ask often), some of the pizza cards he got were by accident. After hearing his explanation, and some of the people who helped him out, I am unbanning him, and giving him the benefit of the doubt. For a person to make an account, and go through the explanation he did takes dedication. He even is passing one of the cards not used along. Please read the comments, and feel free to msg me if you disagree. I still stand by that I was justified in banning him given the info I was provided, and he agreed to that**  Read towards the bottom for the good news..... I always tend to give the bad first.  I would say that 99% of the folks here that post in need, are actually in need. However we all know that some are going to take advantage.   I heard from two redditors that were buying giftcards via CashStar. It turns out that one redditor has been posting a lot here, and got $100 in cards in two days.   I called CashStar, and while I knew they would not release the name, they did confirm the email, and that this person used different names during all the times involved.  To break it down, the same email address got 100 US dollars in gift cards from 4 different posts, yet used different "real" names to acquire a pizza.  I respect reddit rules, and will not post the email address, but his reddit name is AustinYQM . I have confirmed this information, and wanted to be sure before I posted this. Any questions about this please pm me.  CashStar even asked a few redditors if they were from Random Acts Of Pizza, and they support our cause!  This also tells us that CashStar has our back!!!! They noticed when someone was getting repeats, and said something!!! I told her to keep up the good work!!! She will be looking in here tonight, and loves what we have going on!!!   **On to good news:** The manager at CashStar said they have checked out our site, love it! They also said that a way to do international gift cards is in the works, and told me who to email to hopefully speed it along to help us help others..  After talking to them, and their cooperation, all I can say is CashStar Is awesome, and they will be here later tonight to look more into the site!!!! 	True

t3_hvli4	1307635284.0	Rollout	Rollout	I am trying to get (at least) one of the large pizza chains on board with us. (see notes inside)	I have a friend that works with one of the chains, and he is trying his hardest.   I have emailed ALL of the rest of them as well. If we can get them on board it will reduce the amount of hassle that we have when trying to order pizza for people. I know that we manage to do so as it is, but this would make life a lot simpler for all involved, and help the pizza chain gain business, and a good rep.   Here is one of the emails I sent:  ** I am part of a large, and growing community online that orders pizza for those in need. We have primarily been using Dominos due to the ease of the e-cards that can be emailed.    We run into problems due to the givers not being in the same location as the receiver. As you know a credit card has to be seen by the delivery person.    What I was wondering is if we could set something up with you to help this situation, perhaps paypal, or some other means? Perhaps a special ordering code so that a credit card does not have to be seen?  Sometimes people even try to order pizza from other countries to help out, this is the same issue.   Some individual pizzerias are getting involved in this movement to help people. I think it would be good for you publicity wise, and us ease of sending wise to get together on this.

I expect that if i threw in a fake state and zip, that my bank would give me a call about some yankee trying to fraud my credit card.  So, any suggestions on how to buy somebody some pizza for those of us who live outside of the states?  Alternatively, is there a "not american" checkbox that i'm simply overlooking? 	
t3_hv5sn	1307585804.0	GSnow	pizza-gold	3362 subscribers as of now (2011-06-08). How cool is that?	It seems like about an hour ago this sub-reddit started and there were about 15 of us on here, transplants/sliders from next door at /r/Assistance. Now there's 3300 subscribers, and pizzas flying by so fast that I feel like ducking whenever I click to open the door.   How wonderfully, unexpectedly, randomly cool is that?	
t3_hv1tp	1307575453.0	AlmostSavvy	shroom	X-Post from /r/reddit.com thanking this subreddit.	http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hv1hv/restoring_my_faith_in_humanity_one_slice_at_a_time/  This is such a great community I want to bring generous people here. This is just my story and I can't wait until I'm doing well enough financially to pay it forward.   Thanks for existing and being so awesome /r/RAOP. :)	
t3_huzs0	1307570758.0	mofroman		Perhaps this is a dumb question	I just discovered this subreddit and I really want to participate, but every time I order a pizza online, the delivery person always needs to see my credit card at the door, what's the best way to get around this?	
t3_huvxe	1307562490.0	JMizzo		Free pizza for a redditor in Brainerd, MN	We here at the local Papa Johns are moved by this sub reddit. We decided if anyone was hungry and in need in Brainerd, MN, we (the staff) will buy and deliver them a pizza. Just reply and off we go. Heres to hoping we can help.	
t3_hur3l	1307552618.0	wensul	FAP	RAOP is awesome, but why delineate based on geographic location?	First off, this reddit and the people are awesome. A member was very kind to me last night, and I intend to pay it forward as soon as I can.  Now, my question is in the title: Why delineate based on geographic location? There are many people who don't, but I seem to see just as many who do.    I understand it might be a little more expensive for a US person to buy for someone in the UK, but credit/debit card transactions are pretty much universal, aside from some small bank fees. If anything it's less expensive for folks whose home currency is stronger than the US dollar to buy pizza for americans.  I just feel that as a community we shouldn't let boundries keep us from sharing goodwill. Unite, brethren and sistren. We are Random Acts Of Pizza! We are awesome!	
t3_humtp	1307543021.0	jeremyosborne81	shroom	This subreddit is awesome.	I'm not in dire need of assistance (I work three part-time jobs).  However, I also don't have the means to provide for another.  Just wanted to let everybody here know, I love it.	
t3_huldz	1307539033.0	JeepChick		Please read this if you're here and you're hungry. 	I am all for pizza and I have so much faith in the reddit community that I know no one will stay hungry for long...but that is only for a night or a few days at best.   Long term there are a lot of options and I wanted to tell everyone here about the [Angel Food Network](http://www.angelfoodministries.com/), please don't be put off by the word Ministries in the title. You don't need to be religious nor do you have to meet any kind of income limits to participate. Literally, if you are unemployed and have no money or you're making six figures, you can participate. No one is turned away.   Just look what [you can do with $25, or $45 or...](http://www.angelfoodministries.com/menus/menu_2011-06_en.asp).   I really truly hope this helps some fellow redditors long term and can help, (along with yummy pizza) to carry you through the rough times.   Be well reddit.   	
t3_hul8t	1307538602.0	burke_no_sleeps	shroom	Dear RAOP, Thank you for existing. That is all.		
t3_huk5p	1307534898.0	rodger_the_fishwife		A thought for possible UK pizza donators	Just came across this sub and think its absolutely fantastic. My thought was that since both Dominos and Pizza Hut do twofer on Tuesdays, it may be possible to donate the second pizza if you didnt really need it to someone in your locale.  Just a thought.... 	
t3_hujn1	1307532897.0	4004		I would like, as a non-US citizen to buy some pizza-coupons. What amount would do?	I have never ordered a pizza in the US so im pretty lost. But the coupons in the sidebar at Dominos looks simple. If i would buy someone a pizza with delivery, what amount should they be? Enough to feed a guy but not with all extras (to be able to get more pizzas).	
t3_huh0e	1307521087.0	blindasabat		This /r/ made me want pizza, but I can't have any because it's 3AM :(	a twist:  I don't need anybody to buy me pizza, just let me know if there is 3AM pizza to be had anywhere in the Minneapolis area.

t3_hu634	1307490221.0	crayzieman	shroom	My pizza story.	This is not a tale of overcoming hardship and adversity or of unemployment and sorrow. No, this is a tale of one mans stupidity and another mans willingness to forgo that and offer a helping pizza. Did I really "need" this pizza in the sense of would I be able to survive without it? Perhaps not, but it probably did save me a few years on my life. Interested? Well, here's the story:  A week and a half ago on Friday I got paid (yes I have a job, no it's not a very good one) and as I normally do when I get paid, I restock. On this particular day I still had some food at home so instead of restocking on that I did the smart thing and bought a bunch of [beer!](http://i.imgur.com/7bco3.jpg) Now, I'm not a heavy drinker, so a bunch of beer to me is a case worth that would probably last me a month or more usually.  I still haven't paid my rent at this point, but I still have plenty to cover it and get by until next paycheck. On Tuesday I pay my rent and everything is good until I remember that this is the month that I need to renew my plates and drivers license! Stupid me, how could I forget, and now I really need to start worrying.  I get my [plates](http://i.imgur.com/MC5UK.jpg) and my license renewed and it ends up costing more than I expected. Not only that but I still need to put gas in my car and pay for the internets. I did what I could to make what little food I had stretch but by the weekend I was pretty much down to nothing but potatoes and beer. For the last 3 days or so that's [all I've been eating.](http://i.imgur.com/d7P8u.jpg)  Then I came across this subreddit in a post that made it to the front page. As I read the posts I realized people had much worse tales than me. I started to feel bad about even thinking of posting a request at all. Then I stumbled across a post made by someone coat tailing an offer thread. His post almost [seemed to be speaking to me directly](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/hth7t/offerpizza_pizza/c1y8r9s) so I took a chance and pmed him the tl;dr of what was going on with me. He must have found it to be a worthy cause because he went ahead and sent me one of the gift cards.  So big thanks go out to [flamingcow](http://www.reddit.com/user/flamingcow) and reddit for saving my liver from further unnecessary stress. My stomach also thanks them because eating potatoes for 3 straight days really does a number on your inner workings. I will definitely be paying it forward very soon. Many upboats will be sailing your way soon Mr. Cow. You definitely went above and beyond.  For anyone interested [heres the pizza.](http://i.imgur.com/aszvC.jpg) It is an italian sausage, parmesan asiago cheese and jalapeno pepper pizza. It is absolutely delicious and to prove it here is a picture of me [enjoying said pizza.](http://i.imgur.com/iMaI7.jpg)	True
t3_hu5nk	1307489133.0	Jeklah	shroom	Thank you Palanski! Also this subreddit is absolutely amazing...	Thank you so much! I made a random post in someone elses thread last night saying I am a poor student, very late for my time, just on the off chance someone might reply (I doubted it, being new to reddit and a lurker so no one would reconise me...) but this kind person whispered me sayin to send my address and he would have one delivered today!  Heres a picture. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v256/Shittie/049.jpg  It was buy one get one free so an extra pizza! I'm stunned, at a loss for words...   Never seen anything like this on an internet forum, this sub reddit is amazing! I would have never thought to see something like this on an internet community lol...complete strangers buying pizza for people at times of need, even going to some great lengths to make it happen sometimes. Fantastic. Well done guys! Thank you again Palanski!	True
t3_hu4ez	1307486203.0	willyo	shroom	This subreddit is proof Oprah has nothing on Reddit!	This subreddit is living proof Oprah has nothing on Reddit!  If the world was filled with the people in this /r/, the world would be a much better, generosity filled, [trusting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JBQPCHHK0Q) place.   A special shoutout to [jake-the-dog](http://www.reddit.com/user/jake-the-dog) for gifting me a pizza hut gift card! He also offered help to many other people.

t3_httzg	1307463498.0	Rollout	Rollout	Welcome to all the new people on RAOP !!! A reminder to all: Please be sure to update when you give, or get a pizza !!!	We saw a huge jump in the amount of users last night. We are really excited!   We give icons to people who give/get pizza for a few reasons. Its fun, but also it keeps track of those that get a pizza. It helps the community so that they can easily see if a need was met from the main page. It really helps the mods when the post is updated, so that they don't have to ask.  Again, it is GREAT to see all these new users!!!! 	
t3_hts1b	1307459156.0	KatieLynnie		Thank you, thank you, thank you!	I just wanted to thank everyone that is involved in the subreddit. My family is going through some very rough times right now, both financially and medically. It would be very hard for us to ever ask for help but if it came down to not being able to take care of our baby daughter, you can bet that we would ask.   I am writing today to specifically thank whoever posted the coupon codes for the larger pizza chains. My husband and I couldn't remember the last time we had pizza. With the Domino's code we are going to enjoy some lovely pizza deliciousness for lunch. We know it will be a long time until we have pizza again, so we will be enjoying every bite.   TL;DR  Thank you for the coupon codes, it's been forever since we have had pizza!	
t3_htrhc	1307457864.0	Theagor		A treat would be nice :3	I live with my mother father and brother, my mother is the only member of the family with a stable job, due to living in a poor area she only earns £12,000 a year after taxes, thats 19,702$ for you americans..  It would be amazing if a lovely redditor could donate a dominos coupon so we can get away from value baked beans and chips T_T	
t3_htmgp	1307441434.0	streetorphandmt		A Future Offer	Found this subreddit from the main page. I'm unemployed right now, but fortunately still live at home so I won't go hungry. However, these posts have really touched my heart. There were nights when I lived away from home that I'd be starving and there was nothing I could do. Luckily that period of my life ended.  I have a job interview in 5 hours, and if I get it, I vow to donate a little here and there to those in need.   To all the people that have donated or plan to, right on. Every time I start to believe this world is completely shitty, reddit morale changes my mind <3	
t3_htj6s	1307427874.0	forcedme2		This is amazing.	Just ran into this subreddit while clicking through randoms. Holy hell guys, everyone who has donated here is a saint. Thank you for restoring some of my faith in humanity.

t3_hpeqa	1306965021.0	ItllBeOverSoon		A little help until payday...	I'm out of work, looking for a job; my SO is working, and payday is tomorrow night. We have very little food (a few slices of uncooked eye of round thin steak, no bread, some white american cheese, and  some tuna), and what we do have is dwindling/ I can't stomach because of morning sickness. I'm asking for a large pizza for tonight; I want to save the bit of steak for him, I'd like him to take it for lunch tomorrow. We just need help until tomorrow night, then we can go get some food, particularly some healthy food for me. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and once I am able to pay it forward, I most certainly shall. PM for whatever; I don't have any proof of my unemployment, other than my lack of money and my nonexistent bank account.  EDIT: I'm in the US  EDIT 2: PIZZAS ARE HERE!! Thanks to Workroom for the wonderful kindness, pizza's fucking delicious. Thanks again, and thanks to this reddit for existing!	True

t3_hndyi	1306749755.0	GSnow	pizza-gold	Just an observation, and a smile	I've noticed that since many colleges finished classes, there are far fewer requests for pizza on this sub-reddit. That makes me smile and wonder if there are a bunch of parents who are now saying to themselves, "Darn! While he/she was away at college, I forgot how much my kid eats! We're gonna have to renegotiate the mortgage, or call that JG Wentworth jerk."	
t3_hltaj	1306530458.0	clockwire	pizza	RAOP Gifters: Where do you buy your pizza from?

This seriously pulls at my heart strings.  I must admit, fellow redditors, I didn't know human kind still had it in them to be completely selfless. I am over-joyed! My mind is totally blown that something as completely generous and kind as "Random_Acts_Of_Pizza" exists!  That being said, a few of my friends and I (all broke student folk :( ) are stuck without sustenance aside from white bread and peanut butter tonight and if we could get a pizza it would a.) blow our minds. b.) make us incredibly happy. and c.) make me HAPPILY buy a pizza or two for some lovely lady or gent in the near future.  TL/DR: YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING AMAZING FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN! I HAVE FAITH IN MANKIND AGAIN. <3 <3 <3 Also, I can I have a pizza? I'm hungry with no money tonight and I don't get paid till Thursday. would love to pay it forward then!

t3_hc44o	1305500495.0	BostonTentacleParty	pizza	Feed starving social science majors?	~~Well, not starving, actually. We could make lentil soup for the 100th time or so. But we're both pretty sick of that, and should be studying for our finals tomorrow. A trip to the store isn't feasible, and we're too poor to justify ordering food--at least until I can find a job again. Once that happens, maybe I, too, can send a pizza to someone in need.~~  Pizza is cancelled. Lentil soup strikes again.	True

t3_h914m	1305130991.0	pizza_anyone	pizza	Pizza, anyone?	I just discovered this subreddit, and it gave me a hell of a craving for pizza. Tried to stave it off with pizza rolls - that didn't work.   I'll be damned if I'm just gonna sit here on my upper-middle-class-used-to-be-a-poor-college-student ass and munch away happily on a Papa John's pie while someone else goes hungry.  So I'm gonna order me a pizza to wash the taste of frozen store-brand pizza rolls out of my mouth, and I'm gonna order one for someone else as well.  Any poor college students studying for finals and don't have time to cook or money to order food? Or other applicable situations.  Post here for some za. On me.

But every since hearing the minions beg for "stuffed crust", my son has been asking for it.  He has no idea what it is, and I think he would flip if it just showed up and I could tell him that someone on the internet sent it.  If someone sends us pizza, I will turn right around and send pizza to someone else in (real) need.  Thanks!

I'm one of those people right now who is completely broke and negative in my checking acct. I wouldn't be in this situation if I had received my disability check on Friday like they told me. I recently had surgery and was out of work, luckily paid by my job, but I checked the mailbox today and yesterday, and no disability check. So now I'm broke and starving as I haven't eaten all day :*(
