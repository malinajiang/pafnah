I just found out my heart might be enlarged and an av block and have a heart echo scheduled. And I was planning on fasting until Tuesday, but thanks to r/IfIKnewThen I will be able to eat. This is mind blowing that somebody whom I've never known would help me out. I don't understand it. But I am beyond grateful. I am in disbelief. Thank you r/IfIKnewThen It means a lot to me.

t3_538hil	1474137331.0	serendipitousss	shroom	[Thanks] Thank you to /u/ArrrghZombies for brightening my Friday	So I've been having a pretty shitty month, job that I moved city for fell through and I've been interviewing for others but nothing has worked out yet. Staying with friends family as I've had to eat into my saved up deposit money to keep myself afloat.  Last night I was home alone and feeling pretty crap about things whilst staring at a can of soup, I realised that I could really do with a treat to cheer me up a bit. I requested a pizza and /u/ArrrghZombies was kind enough to help me out, it really helped cheer me up. Not only was it great to have some nice hot, non soup and crackers food but after spending a week mostly inside other than to attend failed job interviews it was great to be reminded that not every person is either an interviewer or my friend and his family.  This sub is great, I'll be sure to be back to pay it forward once I'm back on my feet a bit more.

This was a really cool little contest and I hope others do fun little offers in a similar manner. I felt like it gave everyone a fair chance because voting was done by other users commenting on which car was their favorite out of the ones posted.   On to the pizza, I wasn't able to get a picture before it was mostly devoured. I had never had Dominos' "Brooklyn Style" pizza and it was faaaaantastic.   Here's a photo of what's left of the pizza after we turned into barbarians who hadn't seen food in weeks.

t3_4vj3ot	1470000182.0	ls_2012	shroom	[THANKS] Thank you so much /u/pinklavalamp	So I was having a terrible week, been having a hard time finding work, got scammed by my local pizza place, had my bank account go into an overdraft, and I haven't eaten since Thursday night. I put up a request for a pizza on here and /u/pinklavalamp responded and sent me a pizza. I was planning of eating half today and saving the other half for tomorrow which would hold me off until a second job interview I have on Wednesday, but when the delivery man got here he had 2 pizzas, a bottle of coke, a side order, and a desert! I am honestly at a loss for words. I was having a terrible week and I was thinking my job interview won't go well because of the rotten luck I've been having, but my mood has completely changed after this and now I'm more hopeful that things will work out. Thanks again /u/pinklavalamp!

She truly left us with not only a beautiful evening, but also food for our bellies that is t the cheapest of the cheap of soups and rice. Truly, crystalizabeth, thank you. If you believe in a Deity, may you and your family be blessed.

t3_3lhsqa	1442618060.0	robgraves		[Thanks] Random Pizza'd to discover this subreddit	So I was having one of the worst days of my recent life (very long story) and was talking to an old friend from high school on facebook.  She mentioned that I should get a pizza instead of cooking.  I responded that I was broke otherwise I would and she offered to randomly send me a pizza from roughly 500 or so miles away.  I didn't really believe her offer and she showed me this subreddit.  I received [this bundle](http://www.matthewjpage.com/image/randompizza.jpg) of awesomeness at my apartment less than an hour later.  It doesn't fix my situation any, but it did put a smile on my face and filled my tummy.  Thank you, Nicole.    P.S. Now as a subscriber to this subreddit, in the future, when I'm NOT broke I'll probably pizza it forward, this is pretty badass...I have to admit.  ;)

Hey all,  [I did a contest a little over a week ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/3fii4e/contestofferif_i_get_enough_votes_in_a_contest/) and gave away pizza to a random person that gave me marketing ideas for my scholarship competition. A lot of you asked me to keep you updated so I wanted to thank you all! I won the 25K scholarship! You all are the best. I was planning on doing a celebratory pizza contest, but I will have to wait until I get a bit more money (And I'm not sure when that will be, stay tuned). But I still wanted to thank you all for our great advice and for voting.

Apparently someone under a phony name of mine (Something like TedyBearGumdr0ps?) messaged c_mitch_15 for a pizza, he tricked him into buying him a pizza and got away with it.  But luckily for me, c_mitch_15 is a very good guy and still made it through to get me my pizza!  This is just a reminder to those who give out pizzas to be cautious of scammers out there, people can get pretty tricky when they're hungry.   Thanks again c_mitch_15, u da man.

t3_2y5rzg	1425666767.0	Doox4		[Thanks] Clarification and a good story! Thanks Pizzamoma!	Maybe you all remember over a month ago when I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2tipj7/request_pizza_for_middle_school_youth_in/) asking for pizza for my middle school students and I. Pizzamoma offered and there was then a lot of confusion/issues surrounding the e-giftcard, pizza hut customer service, and even a poorly thought out and dramatic [post by me](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2tje9l/metadisappointed/).   Yet over a month later and the issue eventually being tracked to an error with Pizza Hut, things have turned out well- I was reimbursed the cash I shelled out the day I went to use the gift card (when it originally didnt work) and had the gift card refunded.  So now we will also get the chance for some pizza on our road trip to Chicago! (not deep dish...but we'll take free!)  Thanks to Pizzamoma for putting up with all the issues and helping me sort them out. It was awesome!

t3_2xfvk3	1425105343.0	wes2les		[Thanks] Mikes_friend_Tyler for the free pizza and interesting night.	I feel a little ashamed I didn't think much of entering that thread. I came in just barely before entry was closed, and initially thought I didn't even make it past round one. Lo and behold, a bit later, I find out that I'm still in the running and doing very well. I went from casually checking to sitting there checking constantly for updates, hopeful but skeptical.  Eventually the final four were revealed and I was shocked I was still in the running. I figured sooner or later, my luck would fizzle out. Turns out it didn't as I made it to the grand finale and won.  Thanks to you and this silly event, I had a bit of an interesting night which otherwise would have probably been pretty boring.

t3_2uykbf	1423202802.0	jarrettbraun	PIF	[Contest] Sometimes you give; sometimes you take...	**EDIT:** /u/themoosehasarrived is the winner! It's unfortunate that he was the only one to participate, but it doesn't make him any less deserving of some za.  _________________________________________________________________________________________ I have had my fair share of give and take on this sub. I enjoy winning a za, but do my best to pay it forward. I just love participating and the excitement/thrill of giving and receiving. Gotta keep that good pizza karma flowin'!  Most importantly, what I enjoy is when I can give to those who work a little extra for it and who have given themselves. That's where this contest is going...  * **First**, you MUST have given on this sub before. I want to reward you for your contribution to this sub. Prove this to my with a link to a [Thanks] post in your honor. No post? Show me the post where you gave. Also, your flair should give me an idea to your activity. * **Secondly**, this is a contest after all. I enjoy adding a little work. It makes the gift of za that much tastier... Since you're one for giving, show me that in art form! Using a medium other than a computer (electronics), create some artwork! Your theme is giving, so interpret that any way you see fit.  **How to submit:** Photograph your artwork and include the date, your /u/, and the sentence "It's good to give" on the piece. If for whatever reason this isn't possible, message me with your reasoning and I'll give you an alternative task.  **THAT'S IT!!!** Best of luck to you all. If I think of anything else, I shall add an edit to the top of this post. You have until the end of the week, **Feb 8th @ 11:59PM ET.** I will then pick a winner on Monday and PM accordingly. The prize is a GC to any of the big three.  *BEST OF LUCK!*	1423513647.0

Like I had said before, my best friend had been having a rough week - with finals, apartment $ stress, the anniversary of her boyfriend passing away due to suicide - she was pretty down in the dumps. I was doing all I could, but I was also dealing with my grief, as well as my own exam stress/monetary issues.  I had asked for a pizza, not expecting any reply at all but /u/aliarfeen got us. I was able to throw together a makeshift "Cheer up!" party for her with her younger sister (pretty much her other BFF) and she was happy for the first time in a long time. She cried happy tears, and I was so glad to see her in such good spirits. We went to bed with full bellies and hearts.  Thank you, r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza & /u/aliarfeen for restoring my faith in humanity, and giving me the opportunity to make her life a little brighter. You rock!

t3_2nqhqu	1417239937.0	Hotshotberad		Pizza Jesus is alive and well! [Thanks]	Many of you may know the notorious Pizza Jesus aka /u/onthebackstreets as he has gifted many a pizza in his day. Well Pizza Jesus and I have been friends for roughly 6 months. It started when I was homeless and living in a church and he sent me a couple of generous care packages. We remained friends even after I found an excellent paying job and had more money than my 19 year old self knew what to do with. Well thst job didn't work out and things have been going downhill and today while at a Christmas concert my truck was towed. I had to pay my last dime to get it back. I was having a terrible day and Pizza Jesus made it slightly better by sending me a pizza this evening. He's serious the best friend a guy could get. Good news to those who are wondering I do have another job starting money so I won't be in the poor house long.

I posted recently about being a broke college student who just wasted his last money on driving his F150 home from Texas to NJ, only to come home to an empty house with no food and a mom that lives with her BF in NY, and /u/tehcnologirl hastily ordered me a pie the next day(we say pie up here) Thankfully, I got hired already, and start my job this coming Thursday, and will be buying her back one upon receiving my first paycheck. I've had many hardships and cold people over the years, but tonight, faith in humanity=restored	
t3_2flw77	1409971792.0	Xinasha	shroom	Almost 10 months late, but HUGE [Thanks] to /u/airmanhand for the Papa John's!	[Here's a photo of the haul!](http://i.imgur.com/sCxAnmR.jpg) Grabbed some garlic breadsticks and a large meat lover's pie! Was just the thing I needed to end the summer on a high note. Many thanks /u/airmanhand, and sorry it took me this long to use the gift card!

t3_2fiaiw	1409877816.0	Reorn	shroom	[Thanks] psm321 - You probably saved me	I've been having a rough month. Hell, I've been having a rough time for awhile. I deserve it honestly, I've been asleep for a long time. Anyways, psm321 gave me pizza about seven days ago the day I was being evicted. It took me a few days to actually go redeem it, simply due to time and place and ease of access to my email. Thank you guys. I was .. losing it.. your random acts of kindness really do effect people and made my faith in humanity grow. You've played a direct role in helping me keep a positive mentality.   Yesterday I had a minor break down, so I flipped out my phone and started talking. I'm surprised at what came out honestly, and I'm still not sure how to cope with everything or what to do. I will keep you guys posted, it's been an honor, I cannot thank you enough. I promise you, if I ever strike it rich, Random Acts of Pizza will be getting my first million. Haha. Free pizza for everyone in need for a long time.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeM0GSWbA-g  I will continue fighting, I don't know where I'm going but I'll keep going.

t3_2er1e9	1409166230.0	Ramza_Claus	shroom	[Thanks] 4pi	So, of all the people in the world, let me ask:  Who is the single greatest person God ever gave mankind?  The answer? Well, it's simple enough. There is an individual who makes the cheese flow like the Tigris and Euphrates. Yes, this person makes the crust rise as the Sun does rise over the mountains in the East. And because of this person, the sauce rolls as smoothly as a Rolls Royce. A standard hut becomes a Pizza Hut in this person's presence.  Who is this remarkable human being?   /u/jaysecho  And unless you are /u/jaysecho, let me assure you, /u/jaysecho is better than you.  That is all.

t3_2eg1ca	1408890198.0	AlanTRobot	shroom	[Thanks] to onthebackstreets for showing me the similarities between pizza in my eye and looking at the moon	Yesterday, I was concerned that I did not know if the moon hitting your eye like a big pizza pie was really amore.  At about 6 pm, I received a super supreme pizza from Pizza Hut thanks to /u/onthebackstreets. My roommate and I finished the pizza (with a bottle of wine) and reflected on our experience. This is what we would use as the comparison point. If this is how we felt when looking at the moon later in the evening.  I, unfortunately, did not plan this experiment properly. The moon was only a sliver and the sky was cloudy. All in all, if "amore" is what I felt after pizza and wine, I doubt that just looking at the moon-regardless of phase-could ever come close to that feeling.  Thank you for the 30th time /u/onthebackstreets!

Helped me get a pie into my hungry, broke self for my birthday... and then for shits and giggles he got me another 'za a few days later out of the blue. I'm gonna tell myself he's a pizza-slinging punk trying to make up for crimes against pizza in his youth or something, I can't fathom how one guy can be so bafflingly kind to strangers.

I was wrongfully (very) terminated. And I fell into a really bad depression. I couldn't do anything. It was getting scary.   I came to reddit.  Reddit brought me fuzzy_pickles.  Pickles bought me stuffed crust.   For the first time in over a week - my stomach does not literally hurt from hunger - and I'm feeling confident about this interview because of it.

I actually had an account a few years ago but deleted it because people were very mean when it came to requesting pizzas when I was in need.  I was a struggling student that did need alot of help and would use this site when really needed it.  Most nights I would go with little to nothing to eat, but then things started looking up and now I am more financially stable.  I swore that when I made this new account that I would only post an offer when its for my nieces, nephews or the kids I mentor and coach basketball to.  I have posted an offer before and im looking to post another one after im finished planning my nieces birthday party.  I will make sure that its fair and no matter what, it will be strange.  You guys on reddit are the best and some times the worst but hey.... I would not trade you all for the world :)

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/lLBT8tO.jpg) Ralphie modeling our delicious pizza box.  I couldn't get her to be as adorable and as visible as she usually is, and I was really hungry and wanted to crack open the box of delicious pizza, so here's a different picture of Ralphie lying on a pizza box.

t3_2ajp03	1405208810.0	czerniana	shroom	[thanks] for making 30 a little less painful	So, I've been struggling a lot in the past few months.  I had finally moved out of my parents house again and was working a job I loved (though it was severely stressful).  About midway through May my boss pulled me to the side and told me that I just wasn't working out.  That he thought I was a good employee but that for the position I was in I needed to be excellent and he just wasn't willing to wait for me to get there. (had the job for eight months).    For a bit of history, I suffer from many mental health problems including severe anxiety disorder and major depression.  They have crippled me to the point of hospitalization several times in my life and I have never been able to 'kick them'.  Since May I have been absolutely terrible.  I can hardly get out of bed, I can't force myself to do anything.  I'm so discouraged with my career that I don't want another job in the field but I am not able to find another job.  To top it all off, after five years without it, I had to start therapy again.  I started last week.  Needless to say, my 30th birthday was not shaping up to be the success I had hoped it would be for my entire 20's.    I can take comfort in things though.  /u/homeless_wonders was kind enough to gift me a pizza, probably not knowing just how much it would mean to me.  I got to spend a nice night eating Papa Johns, listening to spotify, and raiding in World of Warcraft.  For a little sliver of my day I got to forget about all of the shit.  And that means a hell of a lot to me.  So thank you so much. It was the best (and only) gift I got this year.

t3_22kq9q	1397012035.0	chemistreddit	shroom	[THANKS] to MCRAGEQUIT science can continue!	First off, a **huge** thank you to /u/MCRAGEQUIT. Here's my story:   I'm a 4th year PhD student studying physical chemistry (I also have a [science blog/podcast](http://www.thecollapsedwavefunction.com) if you're interested). Tonight I was stuck working long, *long*, ***long*** hours in the lab. Probably close to 26 hours by the end of everything. I stumbled upon this subreddit at decided to give it a try. Totally worth it - I will be paying it forward for sure.   [Here's a picture](http://imgur.com/a/rQgR9) of my lab as well as the pizza on my desk. I had a bunch of extra money on the gift card. I figured I could either buy more pizza that would probably go to waste, save the balance for another day, or help the young kid that delivered it out. I chose to leave the rest of the gift card as a tip. When I told the delivery guy that a stranger had bought me the pizza and I was leaving the rest to him as a tip he was super happy. So really /u/MCRAGEQUIT made my night and his. Thank you, good sir/ma'am.   PS - If anyone has any questions regarding my research or science in general I'd be willing to answer a few (I'm also a panelist on /r/askscience, so you can also find me there).	1397012421.0

Stressed out I decided to get takeaway and while ordering over the phone I started to cry and I blurted out what happened. The guy on the phone was very professional and let me just spill my guts. When my order was delivered I was handed some brownies and when I told the guy I didn't ordered them he just replied "Have a look inside the pizza box and hope things get better". When I sat down inside I was greeted by [this](http://i.imgur.com/w7C2X9r.jpg)...

A true bro helping another bro in a time of need.  In case anyone's wondering, that's a large 5 topping(11 bucks) with Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Sausage, Bacon, and Cheddar and some Bacon Cheddar Cheesesticks.  On top of that, I got that PJMVP code for a free pizza, so I get double the help, as Shred suggested I do.

t3_1wog02	1391205171.0	davethecomposer	shroom	[Thanks] to /u/closet_genius! In exchange for a an original composition and a piece of fanfic written for wife, he hooked me up BIG TIME!	You can read the original request [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1waw0q/request_recently_homeless_but_will_compose_a/) but basically the idea was that I would compose a piece of experimental classical music or write the subject into a piece of fanfic based on whatever universe they wanted in exchange for a pizza.  /U/closet_genius offered to pay more than that if I would do both and put his wife into *Sex and the City*. Obviously I said yes. So here are links to results (note: the names have been sanitized -- /u/closet_genius is not married to Buffy):  [The fanfic story](http://ubuntuone.com/0IeZHhlkhLIY05uYBw1G4K) /u/closet-genius and his wife live in Australia, thus the plot of this story   [Mp3](http://ubuntuone.com/1wFGEUuHarElam9scCKzBk)   [Sheet music pdf](http://ubuntuone.com/1ltHG6nTkhjDyh8HIA6xFt)    Notes: I had not ever seen an episode of *Sex and the City* so I had to base the characters on whatever I could find about them on the internet. The music, based on the theme music of the show, started off as a fugue but when I realized it was going to stretch several pages and several days I changed it into some variations on a theme. The fugue part is preserved in the first section but then you can see where it becomes just the variations (though a generous reading would call that the development section of the fugue which ends without a secondary theme or recapitulation). The music is nothing like my usual experimental classical stuff but since it was for his wife I made something using conventional Western European harmony and tonality.  There were all sorts of logistics problems with getting a pizza to me. For one I'm homeless. Ie, there's no place for someone to deliver a pizza for me to (I could have lied about an address but then I'd be eating pizza outside and I really wanted to eat in a warm place). There is a Pizza Hut with a dining room about 2 miles from where I normally am, which is a very doable walk, but we agreed that instead of messing with all that he'd just send me the money via Paypal (if anyone else wants to buy me a pizza I will definitely walk the two miles to get it).   Once I received the money I decided to go a little different for the food. And I apologize to the sub for this but all the pizza places in the downtown Bellingham area are really nice and really expensive. Instead I started off at [Rocket Donuts](http://i.imgur.com/vLZO6lv.jpg) with a [raspberry cronut and a chocolate Bavarian creme thingy](http://i.imgur.com/7qHkN9c.jpg) (you can see the laptop that I used to do all this on in the background). Then I went to an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet joint called Indian Grill. At $7.95 it was a bargain. Here's the first [plate](http://i.imgur.com/0jl98xR.jpg). It doesn't look very appetizing in that picture but it was good (also my camera is a Nintendo 3DS which is a really crappy camera). I had many, many more plates and am insanely stuffed.  In the end I had a lot of fun doing this and am very grateful to /u/closet_genius for being so generous in paying me for the rather modest works I produced. Today was literally my first hot meal in a week and it was incredible.  I would love to do this for other people. I do not want to create another post and possibly divert a pizza going to some other needy person so I thought I'd just leave this here. If anyone wants a piece of fanfic (their choice of universe) or an original experimental 20th century classical composition or both, then please pm me and we will work something out.    It would make a terrific Valentine's day gift for your Valentine. Fanfic and music all nicely typeset with whatever dedication you want specifically commissioned by you for them. It will melt a heart or two. And obviously I will work with you on all the subject matter.  Thanks again, reddit, /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, and /u/closet_genius for this. I am well-fed and have enough money to purchase food to last for weeks.  PS Dang, I forgot to mention that today is my birthday so the food was especially appreciated. I'm not big into celebrating my own birthday but had to admit spending it homeless and hungry seemed particularly pitiable. 	1391207477.0

Anyways, she found me a while ago and offered to send me a paper-mache bowl.  I accepted, and she ended up sending it a few weeks ago (I've been procrastinating).  I just want to say that I really appreciate that someone would put so much time and effort into making something for free for someone else, and pay for shipping on top of that.

t3_1r6lwi	1385082370.0	datcrazybok	datcrazybok	[THANKS] Just wanted to say thank you to this sub.	Thank you, to all of those who offered their support, or their inbox. I met some great people, and I was really surprised at the outpouring.   I recently posted that my fiance had gone to jail for a charge from before I met her. I knew about it, but didn't know it was a felony. It was over 5.5 years ago. She was in Santa Cruz County, AZ detention waiting to be extradited to Oklahoma.   Well, last Tuesday I got a call that she had been picked up. Then, Wednesday morning at 2 a.m. I got a call from her. She saw a judge on Wednesday at 1 p.m. and they gave her a 1,000 dollar bond. I took a half-day off of work on Wednesday, and drove down there. It took about 18 hours with me and my 3 year old. Her parents had already bonded her out by the time I got there.   So now, we got an attorney back in Oklahoma, and she was able to leave the state. She's back at work. We work together, and our company kept her job for her, even though she was out for three weeks. My son is doing so much better... I mean, I was doing the best I could, but he needs his mom. We still have to work out the details in court, but at least she's not in jail anymore. And we're about 90 percent sure she won't have a felony conviction on her record out of this. So... that's great.  I just wanted to say thanks, and give an update. I'll be back to pizzaing people in no time, but right now I want to watch what this is going to end up costing with the lawyer, and court costs, and fines, etc... But, keep your eyes peeled, and I'll be pizzaing again soon.   THANK YOU, RAOP.  Mike.

t3_1ltx2w	1378437169.0	Idem22	pizza-gold	[Thanks] to Tarable!!!	Several years ago I was a part of the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. I was assigned to a wonderful little girl, and adopted her sibling as well. I lost touch with them due to circumstances beyond my control but have recently found them again. I had promised to take the little one out to dinner on Saturday for a reunion, but alas, life happened and I feared I would have to postpone due to a [temporary] financial setback. Tarable found me in the contest she ran and chose to bless me with a gift card. She even stepped out of bounds and made it to a local place that is dine-in so I can still treat these little suckers face to face.   It means more than I can properly convey. She did this without even knowing my circumstance.  I look forward to paying it forward again in the near future.  TLDR; Tarable is helping me feed a sweet pregnant teenager:)

t3_1jdxzx	1375229896.0	2days	FAP	[Thanks]Sorry for not paying it forward as I wanted too...	First off thanks again Throwawaydusk for supplying my pizza last time it was delicious and you made the night. Now unfortunately as I told a lot of people last week about my wallet incident well it got worse. So even though my cash was still in there somehow somebody must have gotten the wallet before the girl saw it after I had left the pump. THey must have grabbed my ATM card and ran when they saw somebody pull up I am not sure. So after I met up with the fine lady she gave me my wallet (I originally didnt check my atm card after my wallet since I figured since I knew who had it she wouldnt be that dumb, I should have in hind sight probably could have stopped the theft) I gave her $20 and a pie and moved on. I got home and noticed that I was missing my atm card, instantly went online and saw it had been drawn dry :(. Lost my rent, bills, car payment a bunch of money. Now the bank is covering it so its not like I am completely screwed but for such large sums it takes 4-5 days to process. I just wanted to let the people here I plan on paying it forward either when I get credited or pay check next week, which ever comes first thanks guys and keep on given!   **EDIT: It was not the girl who gave me back the wallet, I figure people might suspect her but I called her after I met up with her how many cards she counted when she found it, she said she counted only 2 and I have 3. She also pulled up in a Lexus F Sport so I doubt she needed it** 	1375230181.0

t3_1dyd24	1368044943.0	bookofmorgan		[Thanks] Better late than never, but a HUGE thanks to /u/pushisti for thinking of a perfect stranger on a very special day	I got pizza'd last week during finals at my university. /u/pushisti helped my studies go a little bit better with a big ol' meatlovers. We played phone tag and pm-tag for a day or so but it got there just in time.  But here's the kicker:  /u/pushisti found out that she is pregnant that day. I don't know about you guys, but that sounds like pretty freaking big news to me. It warmed my heart that on a day as important as that, she didn't forget about some college kid who needed some pizza to go with his cheap beer. :)   So thank you, pushisti, and I will make sure to pay it forward with an offer of my own in the very new future. And of course congrats!

t3_1d9hq5	1367136415.0	razorbladecherry	shroom	[THANKS] /u/raspberryseltzer for our anniversary dinner!	/u/raspberryseltzer posted Friday night that she wanted to buy pizza for someone, you just had to meet simple criteria and then give a good reason why. I replied to say that this Sunday (today!!!) is me and my husband's one year wedding anniversary and we can't really afford to go out to eat or do much aside from spending the night at our wedding night hotel. Pizza would have been more than great for us. She went above and beyond to not only try to get us dinner, but to somewhere local, not just a chain place. And even though that fell through (surprisingly, restaurants won't someone buy a giftcard over the phone. Lol), she still went out of her way to get us dinner at Applebees. She deserves so much awesome Karma, both the internet kind and the real, good for your soul kind. I'll update this post with pictures from dinner tonight when we go. Thank you again /u/raspberryseltzer.   And please, don't upvote me. Go to her profile and upvote her posts and comments. She's the awesome one.

He's hungry, but he knows he won't have time to make something - he doesn't know there's pizza waiting in the fridge for him. :D   It's been a really lousy week, but you really helped to cheer me up. And I'm certain he'll be beyond grateful when he's got something to nom on when he gets home.

t3_1b4na6	1364412957.0	yall_weird	shroom	[Thanks] to ThisFreaknGuy for going WAY above and beyond and keeping me full!	So last night I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1b33f3/request_camden_sc_usa_broke_until_thursday_and/) and got a nice message from **ThisFreaknGuy** offering to help me out. All of the pizza joints around me were closed, but he said he'd be willing to help me out when they opened. He asked me what I would like, and trying to not be a burden, I told him that any size of cheese pizza would do. While coming back from my lunch hour (which was definitely lunchless), I see a Pizza Hut guy coming down the hallway. The way I felt at that moment was incredible. Cheese pizza would have done it for me, but **ThisFreaknGuy** hooked me up with:  * Large Stuffed Crust Cheese Pizza with Pepperoni and Bacon  * 2 Orders of Cheese Sticks * 1 Order of Chocolate Sticks (amazing, didn't know they existed!) * 2 Liter Pepsi * He also threw in a **$5 donation to the Red Cross!**  This subreddit is a wonderful thing, and **ThisFreaknGuy** deserves a medal or something. As soon as I'm able, I'll be on the prowl and ready to pay it back via this subreddit.   If you're interested, [here](http://i.imgur.com/SpJZTGd.jpg) is a picture of the goods!

Will update with another post when we get the pizzas, but for now huge thanks to /u/Fuzzy_Pickles for his contest (which was who could come up with the best idea for a contest (whoa... meta)). He rules!   Check out the contest I came up with in the future (unless it's already been held). This was my comment that spawned the idea (not to brag, just giving the info for future contest entrants):  "Have a contest of people showcasing their best skill in a capturable medium. That way you are leaving it open and not restricting to writers, artists, etc. Someone could win by writing a short story, drawing sketches of other redditors, writing a song. The best part would be assessing what is your best skill and showcasing it."   General location: at the time of contest, Michigan. At the time of consumption, St. Louis, MO. Yay /u/Fuzzy_Pickles! Yay /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza!

t3_14zws8	1355759692.0	icycreamy	shroom	[Thanks] Pizza Girl would like to thank gonffen for his fine contribution. Picture and promised story inside!	My baby: http://imgur.com/gIUyC   Domino's was the only pizza place open past midnight in our college town. Thus, it was the go-to late night haven for drunken undergrads, myself being the most memorable.   I would bang on their doors at night, ten minutes before closing time, while they sat and taunted me through the glass, refusing to acquiesce my requests.  I crowned myself their best customer, and as such, I would often barge in, demanding that they give me free breadsticks because I was Pizza Girl and HELLOOOO didn't they know who I was?!  Often, they actually obliged.  One time, I tried to fight a random other customer because she was laughing at me.  Domino's did not like that.  They threw me out.   After a couple more run-ins and obscene drunken calls to delivery drivers, it was decided I should not show my face at the local Domino's for a while.  I moved on to Papa John's.  After a month, Domino's personally called me and said they missed me, and that they would enjoy doing business with me again.  The police will never forget me.   PIZZA GIRL LIVES FOREVER!

I'm not used to having stuff just given to me, i'm actually quite still in awe that there's people like raspberryseltzer still.   S(he) asked that I'd donate $5 to St. Jude, a promise I intend on keeping as soon as I am paid this Monday or Tuesday (job is kind of inconsistent with payday) and will provide [PROOF] when I do so.   Seriously though, I wish I could thank you enough, but I can't. There's no words that will accomplish what I feel right now.  Happy pizza everyone, and remember, there are awesome people like raspberryseltzer still out there.

t3_12b0jg	1351552827.0	wonderland_lily	PIF	[Thank you] RoAP community!	With all of the negativity there's been on this sub reddit lately I thought some positive thoughts were in order. So I just want to say thank you to the entire RoAP community; the mods for running this awesome sub, all of the generous and kind hearted givers, and everyone involved in making this sub what it is. Yes there are a lot of trolls requesting pizza just to get a free pizza but we should all really refrain from instantly jumping on their request with negative, angry, and mean comments. If you feel its a scam, don't pizza the person and take it to the mods, no harm done. All of the angry responses to requests are causing some good redditors to refrain from posting legitimate requests for fear of the backlash that will result. That's also not fair to the givers who want to try to help someone who truly is in need. Please don't let the selfish actions of a few take away from the overall kindness of this sub. Yes I realize I have been pizza'd a few times and haven't given back.... yet. To be honest the first 2 pizzas I received were the only things I ate during those weeks. This site has honestly kept me alive through some really hard times and now that things are starting to turn around for me I will be giving back. I already have some fun contests planned. These days there are a whole lot of people going through some extremely difficult times and I would hate to think that one person who finally got up the courage to ask for help he/she so desperately needed was met with such hostility as I have seen on so many of the request comments. With all the negativity in our world today we shouldn't add to it in a place that has already done and continues to do so much good.  So a big **THANK YOU** to all givers past, present, and future!  Let's keep the awesomeness alive! =)

Fordgawn was sweet enough to offer me a GC to Dominos -- but unfortunately my local store's computers were down so they couldn't take GC's last night. I was mega bummed, but tonight things were running fine and I finally got pizza! Enough for at least 3 days too!!!! God bless Dominos "coupons" :)  [Check out my pizza action!!!](http://i1263.photobucket.com/albums/ii639/allthingsglitter/8A2135CC-F125-4EB2-8424-54BD5AC19BF8-2971-000002AD29BB5BD5.jpg)  Please excuse the chipped manicure :( And yes, the pepperoni pie is messed up, but I'm just happy to have delicious noms today :)  Fordgawn, thank you again for your kindness. Pizza might be a minor thing, but it goes a long way to help the morale (and the stomach!!) of someone who's not having the best time at the moment :)   Note: Fordgawn is also awesome for loving zombies, horror movies and Tom Savini. SO MUCH AWESOME IN ONE REDDITOR!

Sorry it took me so long to get this up, but school has been really bad lately (Never take an immunology course - ever). Anyways, a few weeks ago jkhamilt27 did a competition for people saying their favorite John Denver lyric. She liked my story and gave me a 25$ gift card, and even called and e-mailed the Papa Johns people when it didn't show up immediately! That weekend, it was also 50% off all online orders, so she really bought me 4 extra large pizzas, 2 things of bread sticks and a couple 2 liters of soda! It fed 7 college kids for 4 entire days of pizza filled glory. I've got a picture of the pizza madness on my phone, but I'm having trouble uploading it, so once I figure out what's wrong I'll get it up for everyone in an edit.   Once again, thank you jkhamilt27!!

A couple of days ago PSM321 held a little contest with the prize being delicious pizza [link to that post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/zzvnm/offer_im_hungry_for_pizza_but/).   Being in Canada the process of getting a pizza to me was long and pretty annoying, honestly I would have expected anyone else to just say "Sorry man, I tried" and continue about their day. Instead however PSM321 was kind enough to send me a domino's gift card, it blew me away honestly.  Well it came today and I just wanted to say thank you, with that and a little money I had left over I was able to get dinner for this evening and lunch for my little brother and sister tomorrow. Thank you very much for your kindness, I hope that some time soon I'll be able to show the kindness you showed me to another redditor in need of pizza.

Had to travel a bit to get to a place that would take the gift card, but still made up for it getting 30 dollars of Chinese food for 5 bucks.

We're stuffed and there's lots of leftovers for cold pizza breakfast.  [Mom's BF and mom hiding.](http://i.imgur.com/wgYxe.jpg) A hawaiian pizza with jalapenos  [White sauce pizza for me.](http://i.imgur.com/SgM7y) Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, onions. Super yum.  I didn't take a picture of the cheese bread because I forgot before it was eaten, sorryyy.  I'm now going to watch some wildest police chases or some other form of mindless TV and try to see over my hugely full belly of happyness and cheese.  So after that long-winded post I just want to say THANK YOU! My family wants to give you guys huuuuuuuge hugs (and the little one maybe peek-a-boo instead). You really made our night a lot better.

NEVER FORGET YOU ARE ALL AWESOME!!!!  	
t3_yz1ax	1346177392.0	DEStudent	PIF	[Thanks] to KristieKitty- You never know.....	I wanted to take a moment to thank KristieKitty- Our RAOP cheerleader for being so kind and generous to treat me and my husband to lunch today. I wanted to make this message extra special as a reminder to us all, never underestimate a small acts of kindness. It may be "just pizza" but when you're having an awful day or even a great day, it can mean all the world to have a pizza GC. It may be a meal or a couple meals, a congrats on a job well done or a please cheer up. Kristie really cheered me up. My husband and I were the victims of a hate crime last night and being able to not have to fuss for lunch meant the world.  Thank you! And be good to one another. Love one another or at least keep the negativity to a minimum!

t3_yqesm	1345776947.0	ItslikehelpingBatman		[Thanks] Jackyrb!	First off, I need to tell everyone to make sure that you include as much information as necessary to receive a gift card. I only received an email with an embedded link which led me to a blank page. I did not include a postal address with the information initially given in my pm to Jackyrb. Since she had become incognito, it became impossible to get her to contact Domino's to at least get her cc refunded. It took several frustrating rounds of customer support from Domino's before I finally got a gift card.   It took a while but once everything was cleared up, I got myself a chicken bacon sandwich and an artisan spinach feta pizza. Both were absolutely delicious. It was sorely needed and much appreciated. It may seem trite to read this, but a moment of cheer can have a profound cascading effect on a person's life. Much like a song heard at the right time, a pizza can save a life.  Thanks!

t3_yg6j7	1345333091.0	AllyWa	shroom	[Thanks] to sheenobu for the amazing gift.	My parents had just found out about my girlfriend and I and are basically ignoring me- (to the point where they aren't paying me back money they owe me and putting me in serious financial straits). I never expected my own parents to react this way about something like this- and it's breaking my heart.   sheenobu just- god I can't even express the amazing gift they gave me. I should be able to at least be fed properly for a long long time, and knowing that there is a place like this not only to offer support for food- but emotional support as well- people's kindness just blow me away sometime.  Thank you so much, sheenobu. You are seriously the brightest thing in my day today. All the love and karma and good feels towards you. Thank you.

PastafarianTwit, kind and generous soul, almost immediately contacted me with a Domino's Gift Card! Not only was this a kind act in itself, but the card was enough for a rather large meal... so I had a friend over and we made a day of it!  Without you, I would have had a mundane peanut butter an jelly sandwhich and probably just watched Hulu repeats on end. Because of your kindness, though, I ended up having a pizza party!  Thank you very much, and I hope to honor your kindness by passing this on in my next paycheck.  You rock.  ~Marcian

t3_w65nz	1341645988.0	CalicoBlanc		[Thanks] meteorliath	First time posting on RAOP, or even Reddit for that matter.  First post from someone actually basically called me liar about my situation and how I found the site, but then blaurum made me feel welcome and shooed them away.  After that meteorliath offered me a gift card, and I'm very appreciative of it, although I did not take it. My daughter was quite hungry, so I walked us to town and had to ask somebody to buy her food.   But I still really, really appreciate the gift card offer.  Cheers, RAOP

Actually, four months ago, things were extremely different.  I was in a bad situation and I went hungry, a lot.  But thankfully, now I have a wonderful job and I'm able to give gift cards instead of asking for them. :)  I just wanted to say thank you, to all of you wonderful, beautiful people who have the most golden hearts I've ever seen.

t3_vtrkw	1341023844.0	_jeth	FAP	[THANKS] yunododat for cheering up my night!	I did not win the contest yunododat sponsored earlier this evening, but he was feeling generous and contacted me to offer me a pie after his evening plans got somewhat scuttled.  It was unexpected and very, very sweet.  :))  I have been sick the past few days and food (and cash) supplies have been low, so this is a real pick-me-up.   Thank you again for the generous offer!  I will be paying it forward in a few weeks.  :D  I'm already scheming what my contest will entail.    Edit:  I also will credit yunododat with pulling off some magic for me.  I had a date for Saturday and I was sad because my doctor couldn't confirm what I had and therefore I may, in fact, be contagious.  I explained it to my date fearing he would reschedule me, but instead he told me he has an amazing immune system and likes russian roulette so he's still coming for our date.  I may feel like blech, but I'm still going to get some cuddles.  I feel like these events are directly related, so thank you yunododat for pulling off another good deed for me!  Edit2:  My date went so well that we had to put the pizzas to use already last night.  They were delicious and they helped keep an already awesome date going strong.  :)))  I see him again on Tuesday or Wednesday!  So thank you AGAIN again.  :D	1341182705.0

t3_vtcqr	1341005685.0	kristekitty		[thanks] raop for a great year! (and guess what, it's long!)	it was one year ago today i found my way here by reading an abc news article about strangers giving out pizza just because. my youngest son had gone to spend little over month with his father in arizona and it was very first time i'd ever been on my own. i'd been a wife and mother since 18 and i felt so lonely.  what the hell, i said to myself, let's see what happens. so i make post about being alone with son gone and that what i'd really like is to find a group that maybe met for pizza near me, because i was hoping to find some new friends. and boy, did i! it was probably about an hour before i got an offer. i remember as i was waiting for pizza thinking no way would it be real, even as i ate it i couldn't believe that people like you guys exist.  after that i couldn't stay away. just seeing what you all do for each other made me feel better every day i saw it, which led to me going around and posting YAY on all the givers threads. i NEVER expected that one word would come to define me and how i'm seen. but damn does it make me feel all squishy inside when i hear some of you say such sweet things about me!   i've received so much from you all. pizza, care packages, dog food, gift cards and even cash mailed to me and my son for our only christmas' presents this year. but it isn't just the things, because i'd never accept another one if it meant keeping your friendships. the support you've given... wow. i hope each of you gets exactly what I think you deserve, cuz it's alot!  so thank you, raop, for helping me find my strength this year. having so many people support and encourage me has done my confidence so much good. even if i think you people think to much of me!  hugs to all!

t3_vgqtf	1340416005.0	pclinger	pizza-gold	[Contest] Who can order pizza the fastest? Better get clicking!!	Hi all! :) Here's a contest to see who can order a pizza the fastest.  **Contest Rules:**  1. Please only order **ONE pizza** 2. Make a post below saying if you got pizza!  Also, please create a [Thanks] thread so that my RAOP stats stay up to date.  How do you get your pizza?  1. Head over to www.pizzahut.com 2. *Only order ONE pizza* 3. Use this gift card when checking out: 6066 3384 2282 6128   Pretty sure the card has about $60-70 on it still, so anywhere 3-5 people should be able to get pizza *if everyone plays nice* (please don't use more than you should!).  So please, don't be a jerk, and enjoy your pizza.  The race is on -- GOOD LUCK!  If people play nice this time, I will consider doing this more in the future.  Patrick Clinger

t3_t93uf	1336267232.0	catnoon	shroom	[Thanks] Zombica and endoflevelbaddy, your senses of humor made sure we didn't go hungry!	Thank you Zombica and endoflevelbaddy for enjoying my (borrowed) wit. I humbly apologize for the delay. My laptop finally made the transition from somewhat functional to paperweight pretty soon after we enjoyed our delicious pizza. I wholly recognize that this isn't much of an excuse, but I am hoping I will make it up to you by posting thanks now.   As a token of my appreciation, I have two very blurry photographs of my boyfriend and I standing next to our pizza. It was extremely delicious (particularly after a months worth of eating almost exclusively ramen and oatmeal.) We have been struggling with money for the past three months because of the abrupt loss of a roommate and our subsequent decision to move. Both of us also recently got new, less stressful jobs, and started going to school part time... So yeah, uh... that wasn't stressful at all. Nope. We received the pizza on a day where had absolutely no food in the pantry and only change in our pockets, and it really hit the spot.  [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/htmUw.jpg) (yeah, I'm the worst photographer.) [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/s08SR.jpg) (both of us are the worst photographer.)  In the future, maybe when my student loans kick in, I intend to pay this pizza forward--breadsticks too! Thanks again, I really mean it, without the pizza and breadsticks that would have been a loooong week.

t3_sqope	1335305624.0	Defiledxhalo	FAP	[THANK YOU] The BIGGEST thank you that PastafarianTwit deserves!	Oh my gosh, I am BEYOND words.  Earlier last week, I posted a request for pizza.  PastafarianTwit saw the post, and went up above and beyond anything I've would've dreamed of.  He wanted to ship me actual food from Amazon (a service I didn't know they had!), and that was already crazy enough.  What's more was that he went to buy more than one item!  He gave me a [HUGE box of ramen](http://imgur.com/a/mrnL9#0), [boxes with complete meals](http://imgur.com/a/mrnL9#1), and, here's the super crazy part...when he asked if I had a baking pan for those complete meals, I said I had a brownie pan that could work, but he went ahead and [bought me a f**king baking pan](http://imgur.com/a/mrnL9#2) just so I can cook the meals.  WHAT.   Seriously, (backstory time!) I never really had much faith in humanity before I met Reddit (and specifically this subreddit).  This subreddit's existence in itself shattered my negative beliefs about people, and PastafarianTwit continuously has helped me out in my time of need.  He has been a huge factor in making me believe that there are really good people out there who would help out complete strangers. >.< I won't be able to pay PastafarianTwit back or pay this generous gift forward until summer when I can focus more on working than schoolwork, but I *will* get to it eventually.  Thank you, really!  You have no idea what this gesture meant to me.

You're wonderful. I haven't had dairy in a long time because my SO is allergic, so I feel guilty spending money he earns on food that will kill him even if it touches him too much. I love pizza and cheese, but I restrain myself every time I see the stuff because of the guilt.  I did have to call the company and make the order through the phone, but that was no issue.  Thanks again!  Order is on it's way& I am nothing short of THRILLED to devour the cheesy goodness.

I wasn't able to use it, as my little podunk town doesn't do e-gift cards (WTF?) So I told her to go ahead and gift it to someone else who can use it.

I can honestly say that this tasted better than any pizza I've ever had previously. The joys of knowing someone, a complete stranger, bought me pizza is still mindboggling and absolutely fantastic. I really, really, really appreciate it.  [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/AGfyP) some pics of the goodies and the consumption thereof. I will definitely be pizza'ing forward, once my economic situation allows for it.  Thank you *so much*.

t3_sl328	1334998977.0	sanavaut	shroom	just a  [THANKS!] 	I've never received a pizza from RaoP, (only requested 2x and never been in a situation I could offer) but I am enjoying a Digiorno pizza right now one of my friends has purchased in celebration of 4/20.   I was reminded of RaoP, and want to thank everyone for what they do here. so many heroes go unsung, and so many of the pleading are fed through the charity and community of others. I am blown AWAY by this subreddit, and even if I never, ever get a pizza in my neediest time, I know that someone out there is: or maybe they don't. Maybe they give it to their kids. Maybe they haven't had food in a few days. Maybe they've been steady on ramen for a month and need a switch up (if merely for their mental health). People who run this reddit like fucking bosses are the reason I subscribed. Anyone can come in and ask for free pizza, but it's the true Ent, Christian, Fellow Atheist, or CircleJerker who knows that feel and would rather know they did one fucking correct thing today when they went to bed than to save up for another X-Box game or Audio Unit.   We may not all be the same race, creed, or sexual orientation, but we all have known hunger. I hope one day I can do as the hundreds before me have, and take care of my fellow. I'm a member of Alpha Phi Omega, a service-based fraternity, and the worlds largest greek organization (google it before you hate on it), and I can't think of anything more that exemplifies Leadership, charity, and brotherhood (in a reddit sense :D) than Random Acts of Pizza. I'm proud to know this exists, and again, THANK YOU for helping me realize that people are not all pieces of shit.   Love you guys, and I'm gonna murder this slice in your honor.   Prosit!

[http://imgur.com/a/4LRCX](http://imgur.com/a/4LRCX)  Despite the Japanese propensity for insufficient cheese, and toppings like corn and mayonnaise, these delicious Domino's creations are fabulously cheesy, and come with the familiar ham and pineapple, and pepperoni and sausage.  After weeks of ramen, Japanese curry, and a lot of rice (all of which is tasty, though) it has made me so happy to have a regular American pizza!  They are cut into 12 pieces, but other than that they're straight out of home. :)  Thank you again, IdTugYourBoat.  You have made me very happy from halfway around the world. :D

I had forgotten completely about responding to Cacoo's offer almost a month ago, when I saw his message in my inbox today.  There was a gift card waiting for me.  The feeling is unbelievable - I think of how I was not doing very well back then, and in the past few days much my luck has completely turned around.  The universe is trying to tell me something, and today, Cacoo, you have been it's instrument. You, and pizza.  A feast was in order to celebrate.  So, I went to RetailMeNot.com and dug up a coupon code, to stretch the money a little further, and I added a bit of my own as well (just a little, Cacoo was quite generous!) and ordered enough food to feed five people.  Or for one person to put off grocery shopping at least for the rest of the weekend.  [The feast arrived, in all its glory...](http://i.imgur.com/e2rsV.jpg)  [My thank you drawing, for Cacoo.

She wanted us to go to church this morning, but I called her anyway. I let her know we were fine, and she told me that she didn't care whether or not we actually went to church, she just misses having us around the house. (My husband works with my parents, but we usually go up to their house every weekend to visit.) So we decided to get together for lunch at our house Wednesday, and dinner at their house on Saturdays. No more awkward church visits. I guess I should explain that we don't like going to their church because their pastor is a hypocrite. It was hurting our relationship, but not anymore. :]  m2mu is amazing!

I'm going to be honest, when I subscribed, I thought this was going to be the biggest crock of shit board, where I would never be able to get anything, even a discount, whenever I post here, despite following the rules and being polite.   That was until last night when a bunch of the guys and I were playing dungeons and dragons, and a friend of mine actually texted me saying that play7up actually liked my reply to his post enough that I won a free pizza code from him.  play7up, you have FULLY restored my faith in this sub-reddit so much that I love it, and felt that I shouldn't thank you just by a reply, but a whole post. This is my way of singing to the skies, praising you for feeding our dungeon group. Thanks to you, four adventurers were so well-fed, we rescued a ranger party from ogres, and a dragon.

t3_pt4jn	1329438944.0	IdTugYourBoat	tugboat	[THANKS] 	I know I mentioned this in the initial post but, my deepest thanks to everyone who helped out in the Valentine's Day giveaway. It turned out to be much bigger than I had originally imagined. In case anybody was wondering, we ended up giving away well over **$2K** worth of pizzas. This was more than I could have ever hoped for (I had thought we would barely be making it to one grand when I first started organizing this thing). We had a bunch of fantastic givers donate to this cause which I thought was amazing on their part; some people (I won't name names) gave out close to $200 worth of pizza. To be honest, we actually had a surplus (overripebanana and I were still scouring for requestors the day after because there was still a stash leftover cards).  Again, major props to RobSpewack for coming up with the idea, DownSouthDread for suggesting the picture format (I thought that made the whole thing really fun, and enjoyed looking at all of the pics you requestors posted), Glinda_Da_Good_Witch for rounding up more givers, and of course, our glorious mods for pitching in and promoting the event.  Those of you who didn't get pizza, I'm sorry, but don't worry, people still give out pizza here on a daily basis and there's bound to be another giveaway in the future - don't give up hope, there's lots of nice people around here. I can attest to that.  Also, I'd like to thank those givers that took the extra steps to give to our neighbors to the north and the folks across the pond; that was a huge.

t3_prqmq	1329361793.0	Scurry	FAP	If someone buys me an oven-baked Domino's sandwich ($7), I will buy them (or pay it forward to someone else) a pizza tomorrow.	The past couple months have been pretty shitty for me financially, but I'm finally getting some dough in my wallet tomorrow morning. My groceries are down to two packs of ramen, which is my dinner tonight (as it has been the past month) unless someone out there would like to satiate my craving for a delicious oven baked sandwich from Domino's. They have a deal where you get a sandwich, bag of chips, and soda for $6.99.   In exchange, I will buy you a large pizza tomorrow when I get paid, or pass it on to someone else if you like (how generous of you!)  Any takers?  Edit: Thank you KimBERLY71! Pictures coming just as soon as it gets here :)  Edit2: They were slammed so it took a while to get here, but good things come to those who wait. [Thanks again, Kim!](http://i.imgur.com/ntcLr.jpg)  (Sandwich deal is only good until 2 pm, unfortunately, but a small pizza is just as good :))	True

t3_ozpuh	1327702404.0	MCThrowBack		[Thank you/Story/Offer?] Oh the chaos of RAoP	So firstly I would like to thank llprncss1983. http://imgur.com/a/mR9yk And secondly I would like to tell the story of my interesting free pizza night! So first off to start I recieved an eGift card from llprncss...Yay! Because I live in Canada I have become aware of the difficulty of many things for us Canadians in the reddit (lots of things work in the US only), so when I phoned Pizza Hut up I made sure to explicitly ask about if this card would work. The phone attendant confirmed it would after putting me on hold and going to the back and checking. So I order my 'zas and they come to $11 more than the gift card, not a problem, I can spring for 11 bones to get some extra leftovers at %50 off on second pizza.  So I print out the giftcard, but forget it at home. Go to pick it up and I realize all I have is the number saved to my phone.  After giving them the number and they attempt to use it, they inform me they need the paper. So I go to a store nearby and take a picture on my phone of the giftcard since I don't feel like going back home. When I get there they realize what it is and read the fine print saying it can be used at ANY pizza hut location. Nevertheless, twenty minutes later the manager approaches me and says its still not working and then says "I guess I'll work this out, here you can just have the pizzas". Free pizzas, nice :) So me and my gf take our now cold pizza home, and we start eating it! [Pics to be included when I get home]. Halfway through the pizza we get a call from the manager. It seems he has determined that the eGift card only works in the states and informs me that a car is on its way to collect the $31. I say ok and hang up the phone. Then I start thinking, what the hell just happened? I phone this guy up and make sure that what he said is true and he says yes he is about to send a guy. So we argue for a bit and eventually he says that he'll take the $20 off and I pay $11. I'm thinking are you really going to send a car for $11? So I say if he's this petty I will: A) NEVER go back to this location again, B) Write a personal email describing the situation to Pizza Hut, C) Post a petition on reddit (ya I went there;) ) about not using Pizza hut for any RAoP joy-spreading. His response? OK. So I said see your driver in ten minutes and hung up. Five minutes later I receive a call from PizzaHut expressing his apologies and saying that my business is more important than this incident and he's not sending the car, although I'm pretty sure he was just scared of Reddit. So as it stands I got a free pizza but didn't use the giftcard! I'm not sure if they cancelled it or not but I'll be talking to llp, if she doesn't want it back I can give it to a US RAoPer?  TL;DR - Win free pizza off reddit, turns out it doesn't work, still gets free pizza, then pizza not free, then arguing makes it free again!	True

You're the best ever, I tell mbingo - but what should I do with the gift card? Return it to you? Send it forward? Keep it, says mbingo. He got me pizza TWICE and apologized for the first attempt not being CONVENIENT ENOUGH FOR ME.  If I was at all adept at metallurgy, I'd make him a pepperoni medal of some sort.

t3_l3rj7	1317958272.0	PastafarianTwit	FSM	[Thank you] I've been meaning to say this for awhile...	I answer a lot of mod messages from givers and receivers alike, there's probably quite a few of you who've had some interaction with me in the threads and in PMs.  I wanted to take the time to thank all of the givers past and present for all you have given throughout the life of RAOP.  It's been a crazy few months as mod, sure, we do a lot of dirty work and keep the wheels greased and rolling smoothly, but this place wouldn't be what it is without every single person that has helped out a complete stranger in need.  Some days I get frustrated, some days I get tired of the trolls, but in the end I keep wanting to come back for all of you guys.  It truly humbles me to see so many selfless people out there and I'm honored to be a part of this place.  Without us mods, this place might be chaotic, but without you this place just wouldn't exist.  So thank you guys all very much for everything you do.  Whether it's a $10 gift card to a poor college student or $100 to firefighters in Texas, you've made an impact on someones life.  I think this site is living proof that together, no matter our backgrounds, beliefs, or political ideologies we can put all that aside and still come together to make the world just a little bit better.  For the people that still aren't in a spot to give quite yet, I don't want you to feel left out either, you're all important to making this place run.  For all the active members of the community, you keep this place fun and enjoyable to come back to.  Thank you all for making this a wonderful and welcoming place.  I can't say it enough, but I'll certainly say it again, **THANK YOU!**	
t3_kzuyk	1317682315.0	leftnewdigg	pizza-gold	[Thank You] jetboyterp, your generosity was appreciated by many tonight!	I posted a request yesterday, because money was tight this week due to an unexpected expense and just 32 hours in my paycheck. Jetboyterp hooked me up with a Pizza Hut gift card, and I was psyched and not have to dig in back, dark corners of cupboards for food. When I saw that he VERY GENEROUSLY gave me $30, I decided to share with my parents, who have had a rough week. They told me that they were picking up my aunt and uncle from the airport today (they have been out of town for a month because my uncle needed surgery from a specialist across the country). I told them not to worry about making dinner, because the internet had our back. Then, I invited over my aunt whose husband passed away last week. So, your gift card fed me, my parents, my uncle and 2 of my aunts tonight. THANK YOU SO MUCH!  They all seemed a little weary about the idea of a stranger feeding us, even after I showed them the site, but trust me, they were thankful!  The only pictures I could manage before everyone dove in -   [Pizza!](http://i.imgur.com/UXbeQ.jpg)  [Mmmmm](http://i.imgur.com/qJPEW.jpg)

It seems I earned myself some personal karma by my offer. I promised if it turned out that I didn't need to drop $600 on my car after all, I would offer a pizza to the first person who requested. (We missed each other when I first posted the offer.)  **Here's the cool part**: When I messaged kmofosho to make good on my offer, he declined. I told him I would either owe him one, or he could pizza it forward to a Redditor of his choice. He chose to pass it on, and I just sent the second pizza to nathanbucher.  I just wanted to say thank you to all the givers, but also to the receivers who to continue to pizza it forward and make this place such a great thing to be a part of. All you guys rock.

To Reddit mods, I know that RAOP must have a fair share of scammers, but for all the horribles on here please know that your brilliant idea helped feed a hungry man very well tonight and for a few days to come.

The good folks at Austin’s Pizza learned that my wife and I were throwing a birthday party for our four-year-old but couldn’t afford to feed the guests, and out of the blue they contacted us and offered to set us up with pizza for the party as part of their participation in RAOP.  At 11:30 AM yesterday, a delivery car pulled up with *nine* pizzas of various kinds, a huge bag of cheese and pepper, paper plates and forks-- the works! I tried to tip the driver but he declined, saying that he had already been taken care of.  I’m flabbergasted and incredibly grateful. The pizza was delicious and kids and adults alike ate until they couldn’t take another bite. Thank you Austin’s Pizza and RAOP!

t3_jphkx	1313909918.0	zombiechow	FAP	[Thank you] If life existed as it does on Reddit.....(Posted earlier on /r/Self)	Everybody would have a cat, bathe with ice soap, and carry a portable troll face in their pocket. Everybody would have access to amazing low cost education, Fox News wouldn't exist, and Conan O' Brien would be our awesome ginger president.  Joking aside, this community amazes me.  I started reading Reddit over a year ago as a late night thing I did before bed. While initially I thought it was nothing more than /b with a touch of class, I quickly learned that this was not the case.  Redditors do amazing things every day for so many people and it's touching. Between the amazing push for donations at donorschoose.org, providing advice and sometimes solving problems for people who have been wronged, and feeding people who don't have the means to do it for themselves. A few days ago, I was directly effected by the Reddit community.  I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but a Redditor over at /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza completely changed my view and prospective on life. Here's why.  I'm a Biology student working my way up to medical school where I want to become a Neurologist. I was broke, got laid off from my job, and recently lost my apartment. I didn't have money for food and at that point, had not eaten in a little over 2 days. I couldn't even afford a 6 pack of Ramen noodles which I had been religiously eating for several weeks.  Enter Random Acts of Pizza which I discovered from a Reddit ad. I was tired, hungry, depressed, and simply didn't want to leave my bed. I don't like charity but was desperate and posted topic requesting a pizza. Within an hour or so, redditor srinuv (I hope he won't mind me using his name here) messaged me with an offer to buy me a pizza and even offered to help me out way beyond what I ever expected from a stranger.  Several hours later I received my pizza with a bonus of breadsticks and a coke. It was the best meal of my life.  I've battled with severe depression since my late teens. Most of the time it's well under control, but it was very bad for a long time leading to numerous suicide attempts. Laying in my bed, hungry, depressed, recently evicted, I felt myself slipping back down into the abyss and a silly little pizza changed all of that. I woke up the next morning feeling great and with a renewed sense of purpose. Everything was going to be ok.  It's amazing how something so small can improve somebodies outlook on life. If you haven't already, please consider heading over to /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/ say hi, offer words of encouragement, or even better to donate a pizza to a needy person or family. In many cases you're doing more than just feeding peoples bellys.....you're renewing their spirits.  I hope to pay it forward sometime soon. Thank you again, srinuv and to all of the other redditors who have sent me messages wishing me good luck.	True

Cloud_rachs... thank you so much. The surprise and excitement from the kids was amazing. The pizza guy was cracking up because they were running around the living room yelling "PIZZA!!!!"   I will be getting a pizza for someone that needs it this week. :) I can't wait to help bring this kind of kindness into someone else's life.  Thank you so much again Cloud_rachs... and your boyfriend too :)

t3_ipwzn	1310686610.0	RobotBuddha	shroom	[thanks] to unmoderated!	I wasn't quite sure how I was going to feel begging for food. But it turns out that the feeling I got was one of it being the best day I've had in a very long time. Huge thanks to unmoderated for being generous, fast as hell in helping someone in need, and being so friendly and unassuming while doing so.   The second I get back on my feet I'm going to be back here trying to do the same.

t3_iite6	1310020000.0	RobotBuddha	shroom	[thanks] What pizza can mean	This isn't a request, though I might offer one later on. But for the moment I just wanted to mention how happy I was to see this subreddit for the first time today. I hope this isn't too much against the normal format of giving and receiving. But I wanted to make sure people knew just how much of an impact they might be making with this.   I'm not sure of the exact date, but I think it was about half a year ago at this point. I've had a huge amounts of ups and downs in my life, including being homeless. It hadn't left me with the greatest impression of our species, or at least this particular culture. I learned pretty quickly that people tend to stab you in the back as soon as you lose it all. Later on I realized that it was the superficial moneygrubbing assholes who do that, not people in general. But sometimes it's hard to emotionally realize things that you know intellectually. I was finally back on my feet a bit before the point I mentioned earlier. Better, I was actually fairly well to do. And it bottomed out. I was poor again. Not just poor, but in the "I don't have money for food" level of poor. And someone I met on reddit, and never saw in person, bought me a pizza. She'd had an even worse life than I had, and was hardly rich. She was poor too, just not quite as poor in that one specific instance. That much kindness when I'd found myself in what I felt was a really sad state, when I had geared myself up to experience the whole thing of being tossed away by everyone I knew again. I didn't realize it then, but it really changed something in me. I'm still bitter, but I was bitter as hell back then. It was just a pizza, in a sense. But on a larger scale it was showing me that there are people who care out there.   I wanted to say all that for the sake of a lot of people. I think a lot of people who receive aren't even going to fully realize what it means until much further on in their lives. And I think that many who give will never really know just how much they accomplished. So I wanted to share my own story, so that the significance might seem a bit more real.   And huge thanks in general to everyone here. You guys all rock for being a part of this.
