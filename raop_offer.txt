t3_5ccd5w	1478835204.0	fozzywozzy	pizza	[Offer] Feeling stressed and overwhelmed about the election? Let me buy you a pizza.	Take a mental health break. I got you. Not sure how many requests I will get, but I will do what I can within reason. Many places have closed tonight in which case I will send you pizza tomorrow for the meal of your choosing.  *ETA: Priority to people who have been most directly affected by the election. Can't give away infinite pizzas.  ETA2 (12:30AM): Okay guys, I have sent out a bunch of pizzas and my funds are beginning to run dry. I'll try to keep going as long as I can, but I have also created a google form to share with my friends so that they can help pay for your pizza too. Please submit here if you want to receive pizza and you're willing to be funded by other non-reddit donors in my social circle. https://goo.gl/forms/crzltux21nrEocTr1 (Moderators-- not trying to siphon off your traffic or anything, is this allowed?)  ETA 3 (12:45AM): A bunch of people are posting stories about being freaked out by the election. I can't tell if that means you want pizza or not. If you want to share feelings and express solidarity, go for it, but if you also want pizza you have to explicitly tell me you want pizza. Thanks!  ETA 4 (7:20PM next day): Hi everyone. So happy I was able to help out and improve your days in this small way. I am feeling a bit overwhelmed right now with how much I have to get done pizza- and other-wise so I am still going to do my best to get you a pizza but I am also investing some of my energy in getting other donors involved and making this thing bigger if it's sustainable. Therefore, it may take me a little longer to order you a pizza. Please use the form I attached above so I can keep track of everything without checking reddit, and make sure to include your email address or a general schedule (there's a spot in the form) so that even if we send pizza on another day, it still reaches you. Stay safe. There are people out there who care about you.	1478910233.0

Mainly because the video I'm looking for is an old kids VHS Vietnamese show. The show is called The He Tre which means Young Generation. There are many and the one I'm specifically looking for is with an old lady trying to eat the kids.. Things I can specifically remember from this one was there are 4 kids, 3 boys and 1 girl, and the boys have haircuts like this: [click me!](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4XeqCeerefM/SwVch_YSKjI/AAAAAAAACIk/oeWQ_m3tddE/s1600/Faces_8.JPG) Not very kid friendly for a kids show with the whole cannibalism, I know.

t3_5ao5gj	1478062947.0	x_driven_x	pizza-gold	[Offer] Help me Help you, and I'll pizza you on Saturday.	**Edit 1:** I have chosen my intended recipient; I will post an update on Saturday to see if we successfully completed this offer / challenge.  I am seeking one individual who is willing to put in a little bit of communication effort between now and Saturday, in return for a pizza on Saturday.    Here's the details:  I spend way, way too much money eating out. So your job is going to be helping to motivate me to not eat out Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. I DO have food at home to cook, and I will allow myself a trip to the grocery store for an ingredient or two, but really... I get lazy or perhaps even a tad depressed and end up eating out just for convenience or other reasons and I want a fun way to try to combat that and get some good habits going.   Your time commitment would probably be a few messages a day, as is convenient and if I'm successful and don't eat out until Saturday, I'll give you a electronic gift card in the amount of $15-$25 (depending on how many people you need to feed) to either Papa Johns, Dominos, or Pizza Hut (your choice).  I promise to try really hard to not eat out to help you win (and me too); and this is not just something I am half-heartedly doing with no intention of holding up my end. But, this is a team effort and I need a few messages from you each day to encourage me / respond to my whining about having to cook and eat alone. Yes, I'm serious, and while this is mostly in good fun, I really do need this extra bit of motivation to stop eating out every meal, so we can both be winners here. I've given away at least a few hundred dollars in pizzas before, check my history, so you can be sure I'm willing to shell out for my half of the deal.  1) If you're interested, leave a note here or in a PM with how you'll plan to help me and make sure we're successful and maybe a little about yourself. If you PM, please at least post here that you are PMing me, as I like having a public record that the winner I chose was in fact, involved in the public offer.  2) I will pick someone probably around my lunchtime on 11/2, (I'm in CST); and I'll update the post when I do. I will try to respond to everyone and let you know if you were chosen or not, and I apologize in advance to those who I didn't choose.  3) I will pizza you Saturday after I wake up, assuming we make it that far!	1478105650.0

t3_4lz8ps	1464751423.0	eXoenix		[Offer] Not a Pizza, But a Movie Ticket! (US)	So I searched reddit trying to find someone who has given away movie tickets and found a post from this subreddit 4 years ago. Hope it is okay to do it again.  So I have crush codes, if you haven't seen them they are codes in specially marked packages of crush soda. Enter in 3 codes and you get a free movie ticket upto a value of $13. They expire on the 15th of June so if you aren't going to use them please pass on this offer. You must either have a printer to print the codes or (YMMV) I pulled the PDF up on my phone and was able to use it that way.  I've got maybe ten tickets worth and I'm not picky on who gets them. If you have a SO or a good story on why you need to take your kids let me hear it, (side note: you can only enter in 3 codes per day...so more codes takes a bit to get the tickets).  I've been going through a pretty rough time of it lately and things are looking up. Hoping getting out may make someone else's day as well.  edit: link to website to enter codes http://www.crushsoda.com/  Double edit: It's past midnight and I have to work in the morning. If there are any decent needs I might have some more codes.  Edit again: I am currently out of typed up codes. I have more....however they are scattered around my car and I haven't taken in yet to organize, way too damn busy.	1464838630.0

I'm offering a large pepperoni or whatever (one topping) pizza and a 2 liter beverage of your choice from Domino's.    It's *nearly* first come, first served- however I only want to buy for people that need it (Broke and no food, really rough week, etc) rather than just want it. I know I have no way to verify that, so please be cool. Due to rules on this subreddit, I won't be considering to any requests through PMs. Only posts here please. Final guideline, this is only for folks in the US.     I'm also a big fan of the email verification tool, http://rikbrown.co.uk/rop, so let's use that too please!

t3_4kkpdd	1463953912.0	asmith1285	pizza	[OFFER] $20 e gift card to your choice of the big 3	So I've pizza'd previously, but as I am really just a glorified lurker (4 years, way less than the 300 karma for a pie), I have decided that I will offer a contest. Recently I was cut from 5 days a week to 2 days a week at work and so I have a bit of down time. So the rules are simple  1: Imagine you have an abundance of shipping pallets.  2: create a unique use for 1 or more of these pallets.  3: share it with the class.   The contest will end at Noon PST on Tuesday. At that time I will have my wife pick her favorite, be that  most creative, unique, plausible, whatever. She chooses the way she votes. (tip: she likes pictures/drawings)   I would appreciate photographic evidence of the winner enjoying said purchase.   (if anything is poorly formatted the blame Squarely rests on BaconReader)   12 hours left!!!    The wife has declared: diggitydingo To be the winner! She loved the different looks that were created with basically the same parts! I loved the idea of stacking them as high as possible, but I don't have a vote. I have pmed you so that we can nail down the details. 	1464121435.0

Great job!  &nbsp;  Good morning! This will be the last offer for the week before I take off for the Mother's Day weekend holiday.  My brief PSA to you before revealing the offer: Mother's Day is this Sunday.  For many of you your mother doesn't need "things", she just wants time with you.  If you can't spend time with her this weekend please call her and talk with her on Sunday (no, texts don't count).  Giving our Moms some of our time is the least we can do.  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Today's offer is a $25 Domino's eGift Card to the Redditor that can guess the location from these pictures: [one](http://i.imgur.com/2tMSo6P.jpg), [two](http://i.imgur.com/fE1b1NA.jpg?1), [three](http://i.imgur.com/qDSuxVC.jpg).   &nbsp;  This one is a little more tricky unless you've been to the location.  Therefore, I will answer questions, but only questions that are upvoted so it shows at least 5 points.  I don't think downvoting is allowed here so folks can't thwart each other.  Questions, however, are a double-edged sword.  They might help you, but they will also help everyone else.  &nbsp;  The first Redditor to guess the location will receive the eGift Card. I have a feeling this will either go really fast or take a few questions to narrow down.  Good luck to everyone! &nbsp; All posts must be public.  &nbsp;  This offer ends today at 5pm CDT. I will PM the recipient to give  them the eGift card information.  I will also want to have proof that a pizza meal was purchased.	1462447625.0

It comes and goes without notice, but I am feeling the end of a month long spell. I'm not at the level where I need medication, but even my moderate depression can feel heavy on my heart.   I am offering a pizza to one (maybe two) redditors who have faced depression in the past or are currently facing depression. I'm not asking for a photograph of your prescription bottle or a personal anecdote detailing your life.   I'm asking for you to write about something you have done in the past week to try to make your life better. It can be a small act like walking your dog more often because the weather is nice or maybe you called your grandma to thank her for the socks she sent. No bummers. I want tales of hope!  I'm not focusing on the intensity or ingenuity of your actions â I'm looking for sincerity.  You can PM me if you don't want to share publicly, but make sure to post here to prove you aren't banned. I'll be making an assessment tonight around 7pm EST.   Stay Posi out there, guys.	1462066352.0

t3_451mbd	1455089900.0	wetseals	pizza	[Offer] One free pizza, USA only. Details inside. I'm new here!	I've had a pretty crappie few days, and finding this subreddit  and seeing people get helped cheered me up a bit. I'm on hard times, but I believe that by helping someone, maybe karma makes its way back to me somehow.  A short synopsis.... the state messed up my child support payments, so I was paying too much. Combine this with me moving and taking a large pay cut, and I'm in a bad spot. My last check, after child support....129.00. This was an 80 hour check. I contact the family services, they refuse to look into changing the amount for 3 years, unless I hire an attorney and go back into court through those means. Fun times.    Anyways, if someone has a legitimate need...not a want, message here. I will choose in the next day someone. Please, Pay it forward when you can to some one else in need. And please only post here if you are in need...I'll post for just people who want pizza at some point, but let's keep this to the really needy.  I can't do much....but it's a start.	
t3_44zv38	1455063525.0	thenewloser	pizza-gold	[Offer] Free pizza 5/5	WE DID IT!  We made it to the fifth day of my pizza giveaway!  Thanks to all of the winners so far for making this an awesome experience.  Shout-out to the pizza eaters:  [Pizza 1: jojo913](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/442q0d/offer_free_pizza_15/)     [Pizza 2: OlfactoriusRex](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/443ty5/contest_free_pizza_25_photo_contest/)     [Pizza 3: lilgremmy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/44pmkc/offer_free_pizza_35/)     [Pizza 4: Kmdick3809](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/44xlfx/offer_free_pizza_45/)  For pizza #5, let's double down on this!  **WHO WANTS $20 TOWARDS PIZZA FOR FREE??**  Everyone.  Exactly.  And since we're all everyone, let's make it something everyone can do: guess the number I'm thinking of.  The mods have been given the number I'm looking for so, by default, I'm disqualifying everyone listed on the mod team.  Fair is fair, right?  All non-moderators have to do is guess the number I'm thinking of between 1 and 1,000,000 (whole numbers only; no decimals or percentages will be accepted).  We're using *The Price Is Right* rules for this game.  Only one entry per username and users must qualify by the rules written on the sidebar of this subreddit to be eligible.  Multiple entries will void all of your entries so guess once and be patient.  I'll keep this going until **5p pacific this Friday, February 12th** to give everyone a chance enter.  Hopefully this makes one of your weekends better than the last.   Peace, unity and your mom,     tnl-    **WINNER: die07**     You guessed 407398 when I was thinking of 410790. Bob Barker would say "close enough" and so will I!  Enjoy your $20 card towards Dominos's, my cheesy friend.      And THAT brings me to the end of my five days of pizza.  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.  Remember, be excellent to each other.	1455473339.0

t3_414fc3	1452883417.0	0ldS0ul	pizza	[OFFER] (US only) I'd like to give out another pizza in honour of Alan Rickman	Hey all!   I made a post on Monday giving out a bunch of pizzas in David Bowie's honour. I'd like to do the same in honour of Alan Rickman. But I'd like to explain why the loss of 2 such amazing artists hit me so hard.  Our song (mine and my guy's) is Space Oddity. So it really hit a soft spot for both of us.   As for Alan Rickman, this one is much more long-standing. I grew up in an abusive household and was 11 when I read the first Harry Potter book. I was sucked in instantly. When Alan Rickman brought to life one of my favourite characters, I was in awe. He has since been one of my favourite actors. We actually saw Die Hard in cinema just before Christmas when we found out last minute they'd decided to bring it out again.  We truly lost 2 bright lights in this world this week but I'd like for someone to at least have a nice start to their weekend.   I ask for the same things as last time. Share your favourite Alan Rickman stories! I'd also love to know which Rickman film is your favourite :) If you win the pizza, I simply ask you enjoy your favourite Rickman film as you enjoy your pizza and pass it on when ya can!

t3_40pi52	1452647006.0	burtreynoldsthepope		[Offer] The world needs a little more Humor	Hello redditors, so I thought I would mix it up today with my offer...  So I am a your normal college student. I don't have a whole lot of money, however, even in times where I've been days from being homeless I always found comfort in two things....Humor and Pizza! So based on this I am proposing an offer. The first comment on this that makes me laugh will receive a free pizza from me! I warn you though, it's been a long week and I'm grumpy so I may not be easy to please.     TL;DR: I am grumpy and your joke will hopefully make some of us forget about the world's problems for a few seconds. Also pizza.  **Winner is BurritoFurniture with his video of the Trump Printer. Thank you everyone for the laughs, hopefully others enjoyed this threat as much as I did.**	1452654373.0

t3_3y51jj	1451007479.0	SummerNightsMidJuly		[OFFER] Happy Holidays! I have three gift cards to give away to random people who comment in this post	Hello everyone and happy holidays! I've always been a lurker on this sub and finally decided that the holidays are a good time to give, so here we are.  &nbsp;  I have three $15 gift cards to give away, two from Dominos and one from Papa Johns. If you don't have these pizza chains near you, then I kindly ask that you refrain from commenting and save the gift cards for people who live near a Dominos and/or Papa Johns. Also, I'm assuming these only work in the US, where I bought them.  &nbsp;  Anyways, in the true spirit of the sub (**RANDOM** acts of pizza), I'm giving away two of the gift cards to random commenters, and the third one will be reserved for someone who is an active giver in the sub. This will also be drawn randomly, but will only apply to people with the "shiny gold pizza slice" flair or the custom flair. If you've given several pizzas and don't have either of these flairs, consider messaging the moderators.  &nbsp;  Rules:   * Post a comment with a number between 1 and 500, inclusive.  * Do not post any stories/reasons why you really need a pizza. If you are in a bad situation, I feel for you, but I will be distributing these offers completely randomly. If you are truly in need, consider making a request post.  &nbsp;  So yeah, pretty simple. I plan on using a random number generator to draw the numbers. If multiple people have the same number, I will use another number generator to determine who wins. This way, you won't be disqualified for posting the same number as someone, however, it is to your advantage to post a unique number!  I plan on drawing the winners in the afternoon/evening on December 27th (US Central Time). I'll message the winners and edit the post to show that the offer is no longer valid. When I message you, we can work out preferences between Dominos and Papa Johns. That should cover everything, good luck!  &nbsp;  *tl;dr:* I'm giving away three $15 gift cards (two Dominos, one Papa Johns, US only). Post a comment with a number between 1 and 500, inclusive. Winners are drawn in the afternoon/evening of December 27th  &nbsp;  **EDIT 1:** Doing the drawing in about one hour, 3:30 pm Central Time  **EDIT 2:** The winners have been messaged. If they don't reply within a couple days, I'll draw someone else. Thanks for participating everyone, have a good holiday!	1451252827.0

In the spirit of trying to shift this sub from being a **sad story symposium**, I'm offering a $25 Papa John's Gift Card. I'll pick the winner by 5 pm today.    Easy contest, too. I have a list of every song Britney Spears has ever recorded. To enter, just pick one of those songs, and draw it out for me. You can draw the lyrics, a picture of her, or whatever. I don't care. It can be a scribble on a post it, a masterpiece in MSPaint, but keep it safe for work.  No one said you have to LIKE the Britney song you pick, but you do have to draw something for me.   If your kids are home from school this week, get them in on the action and have them draw it. No one wins based on artistic merit, I just want to have some fun with it. **if you see someone has already drawn or picked a particular song, please pick a different one**   In any event, I'll pick a **random** number that corresponds to that song on the list, and the winner gets a $25 E-gift card from PJ's.   No sob stories! If you lost your thumbs in a fire last week and can't draw, get your cat to do it. If your cat was murdered by a Shanghai gang last week because you couldn't pay the $20K bounty on his head, recruit your grandmother. If you can find your way on Reddit, you can handle this contest.  Best of luck! :D -Jen  **EDIT** hang tight guys, I'm on my way home from work so I can pick a winner. 	1450738492.0

I order a pizza from pizza Hut while at working here in houston. Someone must have received my pineapple mushroom pizza with bbq drizzle (I enjoy unconventional toppings on my pizza) so I apologize to whoever received it, because your ham, pepperoni, sausage bbq pizza was pretty great.   So anyone who needs a pizza because they received someone else's pizza or because they are starving or any other good excuses comment below and I'll send one your way.   EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments. The lucky few, please enjoy your pizza(s). Sorry /u/iamjenna for overlooking your message. 12 hour work days can get pretty hectic by itself, with all these hungry pizza lovers the message was drowned out by their requests. Despite not EVER getting my pizza, which left me without a lunch today, yesterday was INFINITELY better than today. I was rear ended on the commute to work, going 70 hit by some jerk going 90 at 5:40 this morning, of course the drunken asshole ran and I was so worried about getting to work I failed to file a police report when it happened. So NOW I have to go into a police department to file the report in person...like why cant they just take the information and deal with it....? UGH I'm so frustrated...  Sorry everyone who didn't receive a yummy pizza, perhaps next time you'll be the lucky winner!! 	1440378224.0

t3_3hl6dg	1439994518.0	itsraymilz	shroom	[Offer] Giving a pizza to someone in need	Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/3hikla/offer_my_wedding_was_this_saturday_relationship/   I'm still waiting on the person who I chose for the first pizza to reply back, and during that time I went ahead and gave away another one.   Well, I want to give another pizza to another person in need. I'm also offering to purchase a pizza for two couples this Saturday, on what was to be my Wedding day. See the thread I linked to at the beginning of this post for more details on that.   Basically, I want to help out, and although I'm down and trying to pick myself up, I'm in a position where my money could be used to help someone out. Of course, I know it's not much, but it's one less meal that one of you (and this coming Saturday, four of you) won't have to worry about and that makes a world of difference to someone. I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by people that have lent me a hand in times of need and this is my way of paying it forward.   So, like I've said in my original post. Please be honest. If you're going through a tough time, don't lie about it, if you just want a pizza, then be honest about that as well.   I'll be choosing someone when I get off of work which will be at around 6PM Central Time today (8/19/2015). This will give plenty of time for users to come in (as opposed to yesterday where I basically only gave out a 2 hour windows, sorry about that :/ ) and get a chance at having a meal tonight  Please try and be prompt about replying to my PM once I've selected you.   Thanks to everyone  Edit: I've messaged the user who won yesterday's offer and let them know that if they don't reply by the time I get off work I'll also be giving that one away in this thread.   **Edit**: ~~The user that I chose on the thread yesterday has yet to respond, so I've decided to give that one away to another user in this one.~~ The user ended up PMing me, I'll keep my word and still give them the pizza and I'm also still giving the pizza to the other two users I chose from this topic. It wouldn't feel right to me if I didn't. Congratulations to [Xeropoint](https://www.reddit.com/user/Xeropoint) and [neonseahorse](https://www.reddit.com/user/neonseahorse). Hope you two enjoy the pizza and things start looking up in your life.  To the rest who didn't get a pizza, I'm sorry. Please don't be discouraged, know that I'm only one man doing this and I'm doing as much as I can with what money I have left over from saving to get me back up on my feet. I truly wish I could feed all of you tonight, but it's just not possible for me to do. Also, I see that a lot of you are going through some tough times, but please don't lose hope. The beautiful thing about hardships is that you can overcome them and if things come to worst, just keep in mind that you're very fortunate to be alive when a lot of other do not get that chance.    Thank you all so much for your kind words and for posting. As a reminder, I will be giving away two pizzas this Saturday, on what was to be my wedding day, to two couples, one pizza each, but I will be asking for some sort of verification (please refer to the previous post). I'm more than welcome to suggestions as to how to conduct that giveaway on Saturday.   Thank you everyone and again, please keep a positive outlook. Things will get better.**   EDIT: I seem to have ran into an issue with my bank and it's not letting any of my transactions go through. As of writing this it's currently 9PM, so I can't contact customer support. I'll be getting in touch with my bank as early as I can tomorrow. I apologize for the inconvenience.   EDIT: I'm SO SO sorry. In a nutshell, it wasn't my bank that canceled it but Dominos. I've gone ahead and email them and they asked me to email their gift card support and this was their response.  http://imgur.com/OLFqT5k  http://imgur.com/VfCe0hv  http://imgur.com/EnnIFjo	1440127209.0

t3_3hikla	1439941998.0	itsraymilz	shroom	[Offer] My wedding was this Saturday. Relationship ended. Want to help someone out.	Giving away another pizza today: https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/3hl6dg/offer_giving_a_pizza_to_someone_in_need/    Long story short:    Two years ago I flew across the ocean to meet what was the love of my life. I left my house, my job, my car, my friends and family for her.  I had proposed last year in December and set the date for August 22nd this year. Everything was paid off.  I was disrespected and treated very poorly every day. It was killing me inside. I broke it off. I was kicked out of the apartment and reached out to co-workers and almost all of them offered to house me until I get back up on my feet and find a place to stay and a car, as all I have here is a military duffle bag filled with my clothes, a flag from my home (Puerto Rico) and a PC I had built to work at home on the weekends (I'm an IT Engineer). I'm... more than thankful for my co-workers, who I've known only for a few months. Without them, I'd be out in the streets and would've lost my job.  So, I'm in a pretty dark place right now, Reddit. No friends (only had one back at home) or family, but enough about my shitty current state.   I want to make someone happy, I want to help out someone in need, which is why I've decided to to gift one of you a pizza. You don't have to tell me your life story, but if you do, please be honest. If you want a pizza just because, then say so. If you're going through some really tough times, then say so. I don't know how I'll chose who gets it, but I'll be checking my my phone periodically. I want to make sure that whoever gets it, gets it tonight.    Additionally, on what was to be my wedding day, this August the 22nd, I'll be gifting two couples a pizza. One for each couple. I will be asking for proof, a picture of the couple, or something, holding a time stamp (and please tell me if this is against the rules of this subforum. I might have overlooked. I apologize if I did)  Also, this is my first time doing this, so any help as to how I would go about it would be appreciated.   If it helps any, I'm in the U.S., living in Alabama at the moment.  EDIT: I'll be picking the person who gets the pizza at around 9PM (I believe Central Time?)This will hopefully give people enough time to post and just about enough time for whoever gets it to eat and get some early sleep. I don't want to keep whoever I give it to up late waiting for a pizza.  EDIT: I messaged the person who I decided to give the pizza to and they haven't responded back. During that time I gave another pizza away. I'm going to give another one today (8/19/2015). I will be choosing a person at 6PM Central Time (time I get out of work). Postings will be done in a separate thread. 	1439994586.0

t3_3gvugh	1439493318.0	xindierockx7114		[OFFER] Got a free code for the Domino's no-hitter, so long as you've got a way to pick it up in-store!	My only rule- I'd love to make myself feel better about myself, so please don't take it unless you really need it! Send me your sob story, I'll reply to the neediest person with the code. Like I said, only two catches are that you'll have to pick it up in-store (as per Dominos rules, no mine!) and I'd just really prefer if this went to someone needy, not someone who's just craving a pizza but doesn't feel like paying for one.

I'd probably write a poem for you even if you didn't offer a pizza, if you asked nicely, but, y'know, I don't know if that's as much fun.

That's it! Go nuts :)  **Edit**: I am going to extend this for *twenty-four hours*, to give us all a chance to get some good stories in here!

t3_3fjnt5	1438549570.0	cbergs88		[Offer] [Contest] Houston, TX: Best "NY-style pizza"	It makes me sad how many people in TX don't know "good pizza." Now, I love me some processed greasy crap (Dominos, Pizza Hut, etc.) from time to time, and I understand how someone who's never left TX might think that Star Pizza is "real," but I want to do a public service. I've lived in Houston for over 4 years now, I've done my research, and I have found decent NY-style pizza.   I will purchase a pizza and an order of garlic knots for a lucky Houstonian (inner-looper or closest to it) who's convinced me that they will appreciate this delectable treat on Saturday 8/8 (because you can only get knots on the weekend.) I'll pick and PM the winner on Friday (8/7) so we can work out details. If you're super cool/are up for it and the timing works out, I might just have you meet me at this glorious location so we can appreciate pizza together.  Hooray pizza!

I don't really need to hear a sob story about why you really need or deserve it - all you have to do is want it, because really who *doesn't* want or need pizza?

You must be willing to pay it forward when you are able, or contribute to some other random act of kindness if it is beyond your financial means. 3. You should tell me what kind of pizza you'd create if you had no limits. (Let's assume you're really awesome at cooking.)  I'll choose someone by 8pm GMT tonight.

And if that spoils the movie for you, watch it anyway.   SO, in order to receive said pizza, please post a link to the song that plays at the end of "Pay It Forward" (before credits). Please have the title of the song and the name of the artist/s. First one to do so, wins.

t3_3bcrt0	1435449996.0	LAXAsh		[Offer] Free Pizza in Los Angeles	I hope this is okay to put here. Free pizza is free pizza, yeah? If not I'll gladly take it down.

t3_3b8vwm	1435358251.0	kennetth		[Offer] I have 4 50% off codes from the DomiNO-NO thing.	I was too late on the trigger for a free pie during the MLB no hitter thing with dominos but I did scoop some extra 50% off codes.   Just ask for one and you get it.  I have 4.  I THINK they need to be used BY TONIGHT and MAY be pick up only but I am not too sure.    I prefer you have a decent reason why you need it but I won't be picky since it is late in the day.   EDIT: Turns out they work AND with delivery too.   EDIT: All gone.  Last two Were given away on forum i belong too as well.  	1435361915.0

t3_3apydk	1434987646.0	OlfactoriusRex	FAP	[Offer] Help me use this coupon for Papa Johns ...	A few limitations: It's an offer for Papa Johns for a large 1-topping pie on the cheap and as far as I know it's USA-only. Sorry international friends.   Here's how you can get the pie: a very close friend's son is turning 2 this summer. Like any self-respecting two-year-old he loves dinosaurs. I would love some ideas on cool gifts for this kid. Please post *in this thread* to enter, don't PM me.  I'll come back in here later today and pick a poster at random (yes, even if you think their gift idea sucks).  Thanks for the suggestions folks!  EDIT 1: OK folks, I'm gonna pick a winner within an hour or so. I'm off for a work meeting (in Alaska, so be patient). I'll come back and pick a winner! Thanks all for the good ideas.  EDIT 2: OK folks, I PM'd a potential winner. If s/he doesn't get back to me in the next hour or so I'll pick another at random, so stay tuned! And thanks again for all the great suggestions!  **EDIT 3: And the pizza went to /u/MyoAMG. Thanks everyone!**	1435029516.0

t3_3731qz	1432469138.0	loqi0238	pizza	[Offer] Life is wonderful, and pizza is too.	Hey pizza comrades, how are you all today?  I will be getting myself some 'za later, and wanted to send someone an e gift card just for the hell of it. Why not, right?  The winner will be picked at random, but to be considered you must post either: a haiku about *any*thing, OR, post all the chores and responsibilities you have to deal with today.   It's not a contest, so don't worry about quality/quantity, just choose one or the other.  I will be taking a break from yard work at 12:30pm (EST), and it is just after 8am (EST) right now, so you've all got 4 1/2 hours to enter.  The prize is a $20 e gift card from either Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns.   Good luck, and have a great day!  -edit-  I took a short break from my yard work to see how things were going, but I've got to get back to it. In about 2 more hours a winner will be chosen. Good luck everyone!  -edit 2-  I just ordered my pizza: Dominos handmade pan with extra cheese, sliced Italian sausage, and mushrooms, a stuffed spinach and feta cheesy bread with garlic sauce for dipping, and a chicken parm sandwich. Yeah, I'm hungry after several hours of yard work (and maybe a couple beers...), and about 6 hours of laundry, studying, and cleaning the upstairs of the house in some random order.   Anyways. I'll be randomly choosing a winner in 15 minutes, so there's still time to post something!  -edit 3-  Man, there were quite a few posts! Thanks to all those who posted something, and a winner will be chosen at random (space monkeys from outer space will use high-tech sub-mathematical calculations to land on a random post) within the next few moments.  -edit-  The winner has been selected and PM'd! Thanks to all those who posted :)	1432485806.0

t3_30ru52	1427688419.0	lank3y	pizza	[Offer] Pizza for you if you are in Brantford Ontario Canada.	It is end of month. Late on a Sunday night with only a few days to go in the month. Maybe only one day. I have nothing in my fridge. I mean it looks like a museum display or a fridge that belongs to Edward Norton in "Fight Club". Nothing but condiments on the door.       nothing but condiments :   See :https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/30rt59/this_is_my_fridge_it_is_exactly_what_you_would/   So I have not eaten much today, because, well see fridge picture. However I do have enough for a pizza slice or two. I just need to go out and get it. Then I thought to myself, there may be someone else in Brantford up late and hungry too. Since I am heading out to actually get the pizza and to shake off this depressed feeling where it seems eternally bleak and cold I felt maybe I can send a pizza out to someone else. I know it is a thin probability that someone in Brantford sess this tonight but if you do and you are, you know, in Brantford, then I will ship a pizza your way. I will head out to Dominos soonish. If I see a private message that says "ship me that pizza please" then I shall do so. I will simply pay for it at the Dominos cashier and have them deliver it. I go home with slices or at least fed once today and someone else gets a pizza too. Seems reasonable.

t3_2vw6nv	1423938643.0	trustmeimahuman		[Offer] Someone pizza-ed me some months ago. Paying it forward. [WA]	This last year has easily been the hardest of my life. I took care of my mom for 2 and a half years while she battled a terminal illness. I had to quit my job and essentially put my life on hold but still managed to get my associates at the same time. Right after I graduated I had no money and has just started a part time 2 day a week job so I could continue helping. At that time a kind redditor helped me celebrate graduating and getting a job.  I'm here because I have finally caught up with my bills and I'm ready to pay it forward.  What's going on with you? My only requirement is that you too pay it forward one day when you can.  So comment and I'll come back in an hour or so and someone will get a $25 e gift card from me for Dominos or something. 	
t3_2vq24c	1423794934.0	cptbass	PIF	[OFFER] Are you a Photoshop master? Well my co worker is and I'm not. I've been the victim several times and have yet to get satisfaction. If you can help me out and get creative with his photo, dinner is on me.	[Here](http://imgur.com/cr0RKSl) he is folks.  He's a pretty nice guy and a redditor but not a subscriber to r/RAOP.  We had work photos taken a few weeks ago and mine was horrible, he's been having a field day with it.  We're having a safety meeting Monday morning and they are going to show some of the pictures, I would love to be able to slip this in for his so nothing NSFW please.  Edit: I realize that this may take some time and I really don't need a finished product until Monday morning 0800CST.  If you can "broadstroke it" or give me a decent pitch I would consider it.  I want you to work on a nice full stomach and be happy.  Edit 2: OK reddit you have delivered with more results than I could ever have hoped for!!  I've already pizza'd /u/amoliski for his submission and I've let another co-worker pick his favorite for a second place pizza now.  His selection has been the work of /u/alo81, he's a big Walking Dead fan so that may have something to do with it.  Check your inbox for details.  I personally liked /u/Raijer impression of Thor so you're gonna get a third place prize of Reddit Gold!!   	1423938979.0
t3_2vez5k	1423575898.0	AndyVale		[Offer] Â£12 Pizza Express treat in the UK	So, [this just happened](https://twitter.com/GivvitApp/status/565134420987117568) to me on Twitter. I replied to a Tweet about Pizza, after searching in the National Pizza Day hashtag. The company who posted it was a mobile app where you can gift vouchers to your friends over the phone, and they got back to me offering a pizza.  As a thanks to them, and a gift to you, I'm willing to use their app to gift someone here a voucher for Â£12 at Pizza Express.  I'll be back in the evening to pick someone to gift it to. To claim the pizza, you'll need the app to use the voucher and I'll need your phone number to send it to you. Don't ask if you're not okay with either of these.  If you're interested, [here's the app](http://www.givvit.com).  Also, just like to point out that I'm in no way affiliated with the company. Hadn't heard of them 45 minutes ago :-)

It's midterms week, time to eat purely out of frustration.	[First off, thanks to the guy who gave me pizza last quarter. I was able to throw a little celebratory party and my roommie and I treated ourselves to beer since we didn't have to buy the pizza.]( http://imgur.com/MHUahag)  The first person that PM's me proof that they're currently a student gets a pizza tonight. I'm in class for the next two hours. I'll check my PM's, contact the lucky student, and send them a pizza.   Good luck on midterms everyone!  **EDIT** I found a lucky student! Keep the good karma flowing everyone. The day someone granted me pizza was oddly enough the day I gave a random girl an expensive textbook for free. All I'm sayin' is, pay it forward and make someone smile.	1422406092.0

t3_2tcwbi	1421978495.0	harrisonboll		[OFFER] The brother/Sister-Hood of the Traveling Pizza. Read inside for details.	I want to try an experiment. The idea is to give pizza to someone, who I turn gives a pizza to someone, who then gifts a pizza, and so on.  I've received from here before and I want to give back. So here's my offer: $15 worth of whatever you want from any major pizza chain (USA only). However, I have some criteria.  1. There is no contest, leave a comment and do what ever you want and I'll decide tomorrow around 5:00 PM EST who wins. I'll try to PM you as early as possible so you can have pizza for Friday night.  2. Again, do what ever you want, no limits. In trouble with no food? I'm sorry to hear that, tell me about it and convince me. Got great pipes? Sweet, sing me a song. Can you do some weird trick? Awesome, let's see. Nothing you think is all that great? Get creative, you'll find something. Just include proof it's you in whatever you do.   3. This is the most important. You need to be able to, now or within the next 14 days, provide at least $15 worth of pizza to someone here (this is the traveling pizza part). The idea is to have a constant offer. Obviously, this can't be enforced, it's on the honor system. But I believe is the quality of people, so I'm hoping it carries on.  Edit: The winner was chosen, sorry I couldn't pizza anyone else and sorry for the delay, things got a little crazy once I got home. 	1422057522.0

First time giving, so may need some patience on ordering.  Post a picture in your Packer gear with timestamp and username in picture. Must be in US. Two month requirement for accounts, but older the better and also better if active in /r/GreenBayPackers. Papa John's locations must be available. Bonus points for outfit creativity, including your drink of choice, guessing my drink of choice, and Woodson jerseys. Why Woodson? Because he's awesome, reminds me of a happier time, and why not? How much pizza? TBD by PM after selection.  Will select winner tonight by 9pm CST (pending entries--photo requirement may prolong this). We can talk if you want the pizza tonight or another time then.   EDIT: 9pm deadline be damned. I'm extending it and giving out multiple so keep posts coming until my edit says otherwise.

In honor of /r/Need going live, I'm going to give a pizza to the person (or persons!) whose tale of need moves me the most. This can be you helping someone in need, a time you were in need where someone helped you, or anything else that you feel sums up a time in your life where need was experienced.   So, without further ado....As a further service to Redditors in crisis, financial or otherwise, we are proud to announce /r/Need: a place to find and help Redditors in need. As many of us are mods both here at /r/Borrow and at /r/Need, we look forward to providing the same level of active moderation in hopes of better serving the Reddit community than is currently available. We are here not only to help those in need, but to make sure those giving help are not being taken advantage of. Because of this goal, we are working closely with other material-based subs and will make sure that if you've stolen from a Redditor, you will not be given that opportunity again. We respectfully request that only Redditors who have been a part of the Reddit community for 30 days or more request help at /r/Need, because this is meant to be a place for real Redditors, not just anyone who happens to google "help."  So what better place to start than with your need for cheesy delicious goodness? We hope to see you all at /r/need! Thank you all, for all you do!   EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who partcipated! A winner has been chosen and messaged. If they do not respond tonight, I will pick a new winner. Thanks again everybody, and we hope to see you around /r/need!   /u/nivanglus has responded, and accepted their pizza prize! Thank you to everyone who participated, and here's to hoping all your needs are being met, ESPECIALLY  your need for pizza! =)	1421481791.0

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/elal2/have_you_ever_picked_up_a_hitchhiker/c18z0z2) post has really touched me, and I want to gift my 'za to someone who's got good karma coming to them, and no I'm not talking about upvotes here.  If you're feeling pretty low right now, tell me about how you got there, and what you're doing to get out of it. Alternatively, tell me about a time either you helped, or you were helped, by someone for no reason.  If things aren't too bad, but you still want some 'za, tell me about a time when you helped someone simply out of the kindness of your own heart.  Obviously, there's no way to vet these stories, but I like to think there's at least a little integrity left in the world. When you message me, let me know what part of the world you're in so I can get it to you before dinner time.  I'll pick a winner later today.

t3_2ntzi3	1417337986.0	chloe-bell	PIF	[Offer] Artists of Reddit!!! $25 Pizza Hut gift card for a portrait of my cat!	ETA: I've extended til Wednesday, 12/10  I've gotten some PMs requesting more time :)  Ok... so, to put it bluntly, I am chronically poor and I need a Christmas gift for my 18 year old son. For years he's been saying how he wishes he could find someone to do a portrait of Sammy, our beloved rescued family cat that we've had since 2006... who is particularly fond of my son and stalks the crap out of him and meows (loudly) all night when he's gone.   We recently found out that Sammy has dental tumors and will need to eventually be put to sleep when the pain gets too bad and he can no longer eat... there is no cure or surgery thay can remove the tumors  :(   My son graduates in June and goes off to college next year, so a portrait of Sammy would be awesome for him to take along to remember him.  I wish I could do better than a $25 gift card or have a better variety, but we are given restaurant gift cards at work when we work overtime (because we're salaried and they think $25 makes up for 12 hours of work) and we don't get to pick.    I would like to have the portrait mailed to me so I can frame it (8x10) and can pay for shipping as long as its not over $10. A cardboard envelope for usps flat rate should do and shouldn't be more than $6 - that we can figure out later.  For now, I'll choose my favorite on Wednesday night at 8pm and pm you the gift card info... or order your pizza for you, doesn't matter to me.  We can work out shipping after you get your pizza... but please be willing to mail it... this is the most important part!  Sammy is a blue point Siamese with blue eyes... he's sort of light greyish with darker points and has more of a fuller face than typical Siamese cats.   Photos:  [Please do not include my nerdy as sin kid, making duck face in the portrait](http://i.imgur.com/jJMMFAh.jpg)  [Begging for bacon](http://i.imgur.com/Nx95EC4.jpg)  [I don't even know](http://i.imgur.com/uquzdDi.jpg)  [Slightly annoyed](http://i.imgur.com/wss5sHw.jpg)  Thanks in advance!	1417455870.0
t3_2nmkvb	1417137642.0	pankocrunch	pizza	[Offer] Spending Thanksgiving in a hotel in Fallon, NV. A pizza for a laugh.	Circumstances have me sitting in a hotel in...lovely...Fallon, NV with my boyfriend and our dog on Thanksgiving. While this wasn't exactly where we expected to be tonight, we're together. Earlier, we swung by Safeway, picked up some misc, and we'll soon be enjoying turkey sandwiches and beer in the hotel's lobby.  I'd like to help out a few others that aren't as fortunate as us tonight. I have 3 Pizza Hut gift cards to offer; however, the sob stories are getting me down. So, I'd ask that you send out some Thanksgiving cheer in this thread. I'll PM the first three people to make me and my BF laugh, be happy, or simply have thankful feels.  Edit: I should mention that Fallon, NV doesn't have much internet, so Youtube videos are hard to watch. To enjoy what you've posted thus far, we've extrapolated heavily from their titles and have been simulating them on the hotel room's notepad. Don't worry, though. We're headed west to Californy tomorrow. We hear there's more internet there. But no more Youtubes tonight please. My wrist hurts and we're almost out of paper.  Edit 2: Eagle-eyed readers will notice that I've offered up my 3 gift cards. I enjoyed this thread so much...and particularly a PM conversation with /u/freshoutofeggs...that I attempted to order 3 more Pizza Hut gift cards; however, the hard-working robots at [Yum! Brands, Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Hut) have decided that I'm likely committing credit card fraud and denied my transaction. I'm sorry. Perhaps, once their shipment of lug nuts arrives, they'll be less cranky tomorrow and won't shaft us. We can only hope.	1417147771.0

So, here it is, but there's a catch. (There's always a catch, am I rite? Ok, maybe not always, but in this instance, anyway). I am offering a $25 Domino's eGift card to whomever is able to guess my favorite Movie.  You could scroll through my comment history, but I deleted anything that may give it away. That being said, while these movies are SOME of my favorites, the film is not:  Rampart  Twilight or it's better contemporary, [Twinklight]( https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=twinklight)  Harry Potter (I've neither seen nor read anything Harry Potter. GO AHEAD AND STONE ME, I'M ALREADY STONED!)  Anything directed by Nathaniel Hornblower  STIPS: Winner must have an active account at least one month old. Winner may have collected on previous offers or requests. Winner must be verified by RAOP's Verification System located in the sidebar. Anyone PMing me will be immediately disqualified. If no one has guessed correctly, I will choose a comment at random and present the winner with his/her gift card.  Good luck RAoP, and god's on speed.  EDIT As /u/CapitalistBrony pointed out: >You didn't necessarily say it is a vampire movie that's your favorite. Not having a single clue of being able to guess isn't exactly good :/  Here's the 1st hour hint, taken directly from the comments: >Here's a hint: I have Total Recall, RoboCop 2, and 30 Rock all 5 starred on NetFlix. The last time I did this contest, I revealed my favorite TV show to be Degrassi (still is, RIP Adam). Keep guessing.  Oh, and it's totally not a Vampire Movie, DO YOU HEAR ME, *Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant*, NOT A VAMPIRE MOVIE!  *****EDIT 2 WE HAVE OUR FIRST WINNER***** /u/Postaback made a correct guess with *Starship Troopers*.  **BUT I HAVE MORE THAN ONE FAVORITE MOVIE SO KEEP GUESSING!!!!!**  EDIT 3: Please keep each guess listed to a separate comment so I can review and reply easier, please and thank you.  ****EDIT 4 WE HAVE ANOTHER WINNER**** /u/usctrojangirl won the second offer with her guess *Terminator*  ****I STILL HAVE MORE THAN 2 FAVORITE MOVIES, SO KEEP GUESSING, FOO!****  ****EDIT 5 ANOTHER WINNER DISCOVERED**** /u/i_steal_space_plans has stolen a correct guess.  CONGRATULATIONS!  ****KEEP GUESSING****  ****EDIT 6**** /u/andsendunits has guessed the last correct answer with *True Romance*  ****FINAL EDIT****  All winning parties have been contacted. I'm sorry I had to lie and deceive the good people of RAoP into thinking there would be only one winner, when in fact, there are four, all of whom have been gilded for a month.   Please post pics of yourself with your prizes. You are all awesome and truly winners in my book! Enjoy your pies and remember how fun it is to pay it forward, even if you didn't win.  ****YOU ARE ALL WINNERS!!!

It really helps me out.  To those of you interested in following the comic, there is an RSS feed at www.space-couch.com/feed.xml ****************************************************************  I was really pleased with the results when I did this last month, so as promised I'm giving away pizza again as a way to promote my pizza-loving comic, [Two Aliens on a Space Couch!](http://www.space-couch.com), and this time I'm giving away twice as many gift cards!  So, I will be purchasing a total of 14 gift cards, each worth $15.  Everyone who wins will get to choose whether their card is from Dominos or Papa Johns.  How do you get your hands on one?  Same basic idea as last time.  I've got a webcomic that I'd love your help promoting, so anyone who posts or PMs a screenshot of them sharing a link to my website (www.space-couch.com) on Facebook or Twitter will be eligible to win one of these cards.  Who wins is entirely random, with everyone getting an equal shot.  I will choose winners at 1PM PST on October 31st, so anyone who has an entry in by then has a shot at a gift card.  You don't have to say anything about the comic in your post, just have to post the link.  Anything you say to help me out above and beyond that is always much appreciated.  You all were pretty awesome last time about this, and I believe some of you have been indeed following the comic, which is great!  So, I hope you enjoy the comic, but if nothing else I hope you enjoy the pizza.  Best of luck to all of you!	1414786806.0

t3_2kgsjz	1414420184.0	k12573n	PIF	[Offer] Tell me about your family troubles	[CLOSED - NO MORE ENTRIES]  I want to send someone a pizza for dinner today.  I have been pizza'd before and I want to help someone out.  Recently, I have become pretty depressed over my dad's struggles in family court with my little brother and his mother.  It has been a long, expensive, grueling 8-year battle and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.  It's become very much a crisis and I want to hear about other people's family problems.  I'm just going to pick someone by random.  I'll check back at 5 pm when I get off work to announce my pizza recipient.  Thanks!  Edit1 @ 3:32 pm:  I am so overwhelmed by the responses here.  I wish I could send each and every one of you a pizza and a great big hug.  I have decided to pizza 2 people from this thread this evening.  I wish I could do more.  I'll post the winners shortly after I stop accepting entries at 5 pm.  Edit2 @ 5:03 pm:  The winners are #1 (/u/AyeshaPorno) and #16 (/u/minorharmony).  Sorry to everyone else, I am thinking about doing this once or twice a month and picking from who is left here so that everyone who responded today gets a pizza eventually.  Edit 3 @ 3:57 pm 11/10/14:  I am giving away another pizza to someone who replied to this original offer.  The random number picker picked #13 (/u/-baabaa_blacksheep-) this time.   I also noticed that I assigned two people #20, so if they get picked in the future I will have to do eenie-meanie-miney-mo. :/	1415656732.0

Keep the messages coming.**  **Edit 2: Okay, it looks like I have to stop now. Both Dominos and Pizza Hut have started declining my purchases for "security reasons", and now I'm getting text alerts from my bank's fraud department.  Please PM me if you were waiting for an egift card from Dominos or Pizza Hut, and you're willing to get Papa Johns instead. Thanks again to everyone making sacrifices to help others.**  I'm making an offer in observance of the sacrifice made by [Cpl. Nathan Cirillo](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/cpl-nathan-cirillo-shot-dead-in-ottawa-dreamed-of-becoming-full-time-soldier-1.2808960), who died yesterday serving his country. My offer goes out to anyone from any country who is currently serving in the military, police force, EMTs, and fire department, including dependants. I'll be giving out $25 egift cards to as many people as I can.  Private message me your proof of service (DD-214, ID, etc) with personal details removed, along with the email address where you would like to receive the egift card, and whether you want Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, or Dominos. I'm only sending egift cards from those pizzerias. For those who live outside of the U.S., please check the website for your local pizza joint to ensure they accept egift cards. I already know Papa Johns in Canada does not accept them. You're out of luck if I can't send an egift card to your country.  I'm getting ready for bed, but I'll start sending out the egift cards when I wake up. Again, the offer goes out to any country, but you're out of luck if I can't send an egift card from the U.S. I don't really have a limit on the number of egift cards I'll send. I'll stop when I feel like I can't send any more.  Semper Fi!	1414118095.0

t3_2htdm2	1412018843.0	MidnightJester	pizza-gold	[Offer]Help out a Struggling Webcomic Creator by Bumming Pizza Off of Him	***************** FINAL EDIT: Alright, the winners have been chosen.  If you won, you have already been notified, but these were the winners:  reformedmikey bordot drmonix councilman_jamm konnichiwa AquaTreats redloveone  I wanted to take a moment to let you all know how much I really appreciate everyone who submitted for this.  So many of you really went above and beyond what I asked, saying great things and making me feel great about the comic I've made.  I know I'm the one giving out the pizza, but I truly feel like the lucky one here.  Your efforts have helped me indeed have a very happy birthday.  Stay hungry, because I will absolutely be back to do this, or something like this, again.  Probably about once a month.  Y'all are great, and congratulations to those of you lucky enough to win! *****************  Hey there, pizza lovers!  Have I got a deal for you.  I've got 7 $15 gift cards for pizza that I'm going to be giving away today.  If you win one, you'll be able to let me know if you'd prefer Dominos or Papa Johns, as I have not purchased them yet.  As mentioned in the title, I've got a webcomic running that I'd love some help spreading the word about.  If I had to boil down the core elements of this comic into three simple concepts, I'd say scifi, videogames, and pizza (which is what brought me here).  So, what am I asking of you?  If you'd like a chance at one of these gift cards, I ask that you post a link to www.space-couch.com on facebook, then show me a screengrab of that as proof.  You don't have to say anything about it if you don't want to, but anything you do would be much appreciated.  Everybody who follows this procedure will have an equal shot at winning one of the seven cards.  I'll randomly determine the winners at 8 PST and then get in contact with those people.  So, anyone who spreads the word before then will be eligible to win.  Best of luck to you, and hopefully some of you just might find that you like the webcomic too!  EDIT: And yes, I'm certainly aware that people can fake facebook posts.  I ask that you please don't.  I'm just some regular guy trying to get a webcomic out there.  In fact, I'm about the most "some regular guy" you can get.  The picture you have in your head right now of "some regular guy"?  That's probably pretty close.  EDIT2: For those of you who prefer, sharing it over Twitter is also just fine.  EDIT3: Since it's come up a few times, those of you that prefer to PM me the screenshot, that is also just fine.  I get not wanting to share the screengrab with everyone.	1412046211.0

t3_2fdefb	1409764124.0	jeffsfather	pizza	[Offer] Free Large Pizza hut pizza... Pickup only	I did a deal online where they send you a code for a free pizza if you do it. Well, I did the deal and got the code, but you can't use the code for delivery without racking up $12 worth of food first, so it's pointless to me (I can't get there myself today).  It expires today, so if anybody wants a free pizza code, I think it only works once, I'll check back in 20 minutes, print out the names, and draw from a hat.  You have to order online, I believe.  Edit: 2 minutes left!  Edit 2: Ok folks, entering is over. I'm officially printing your names.  Edit 3: Let's go...    [And we have names... ](http://i.imgur.com/Vyn5GUR.jpg)  The drum roll is .. rolling..  [My hand is reaching...](http://i.imgur.com/bxxWwbh.jpg) I didn't have a hat...  and.. the winner is...  [CONGRATULATIONS!](http://i.imgur.com/BH6l8RZ.jpg)  Edit #3242 - Well, unfortunately it looks like the code needs to be used in the USA, so we're doing another draw.. This time it's Daddy's Kisses. Please tell us you're in the US!  Edit #5 - Daddyskisses reported the code worked. Hopefully he takes a picture before devouring it!	1409769774.0

I still want to make some one happy.	1406961575.0
t3_2c1r1p	1406646689.0	Lizowa	pizza	[Offer] [Contest] I thought for sure I'd have to pay a $200 speeding ticket in court today, but instead am paying $40/month installments. Promised myself I'd pay it forward if I didn't have to spend rent money on this ticket this month! Give me your best story about being pulled over!	EDIT 2: Thank you all for participating, I had so much fun reading all of your stories. It was close, but I decided to go with /u/mantuatrack for their hysterical story about their stint as a designated driver. I will be messaging you about your information :)  EDIT: Contest over! No more submissions will be taken. Wow, 60+ comments! Please give me a little time to read through these, check back at around 6 EST for the winner :)  Title pretty much says it all, I want to hear your best story about being pulled over, be it for speeding or otherwise. Whether you sweet talked your way out of a ticket, settled it in court, were taken away in handcuffs, whatever!!! Stories about friends and family members are also fine. Whoever entertains me the most with their story will be given a $15 e-giftcard to the major pizza chain of their choosing (Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, whoever has a website that I can email you a giftcard from). I have a "Crew Rally" at my min wage fast food job tonight from 4-5 so I will choose a winner when I get home from that :)   Note: Please don't PM me with your personal sob stories, all that will do is immediately disqualify you from the contest. This seems to happen any time I post a contest anywhere so just make my life easier and don't ;P	1406671275.0

So anyways, I'll give away 2 random egift cards to one of the us big 3.  To enter, draw a picture of a redditor celebrating his cake day.  Digital or hand drawn, doesn't need to be good (contest is NOT judged on quality, it's random).  It does need to show at least a few minutes worth of effort (not just a stock picture) -- that's the point of the requirement (to avoid spamming entries).  That means new accounts are fine on this offer (but still no multiple accounts per person).   for the rambling, I'm on my phone.  I'll do the random draw around 11pm est today 7/24  **Edit:** Contest over.  There were so many good entries (20 in total), I wish I could afford to get you all pizza!  Thanks for all the well wishes.  The winners are /u/FutureFlyDoc and /u/HylianWarrior and have been PM'ed	1406261226.0

Thanks for playing folks, but the dice have chosen and I am contacting them as we speak.  ---- Mods do a tough job, and it often goes under-appreciated.

What are the rules?  1.  You must moderate at least 1 subreddit with a total of 30,000 subscribers.   2.  You must have been a moderator on that subreddit for at least a month.  3.  **You must include an 'interesting' story from your time moderating that subreddit.**  It doesn't have to be anything intricate or long, but if it's not there *you're not gonna win anything,* so wrack your brains and do your best.  4.  Your Pizza Place o' Choice  I live in the US, and I will do my best to make sure that the winner receives their compensation regardless of where they live, but I can't 100% guarantee that if you live outside the US I will be able to deliver.  A winner will be randomly selected sometime on Friday.  My fellow /r/changemyview mods are going to be unable to enter.  Bias and all that ;)	1406321796.0

I was struggling to make ends meet, and you guys really helped me out now and then.  I always promised to give back and now it is time for me to start.  I have graduated, I am gainfully employed, and I'm in a bit of an emotionally rough patch right now but helping others always makes one feel better.  With that said, I would like to give away some pizzas over the next few days.  To start, I would like to give away two: one to a student at Northwestern University and one to a student at any other institute of higher learning.  All I ask, is proof.  I will check back at an undetermined time tonight and pick someone.  I'm sorry that excludes people, but at the moment I want to help out people in a similar position as I was last year.  Edit:  Hey everyone, I really wish I could give everyone a pizza who was nice enough to comment, but I could only give to one, u/pizzaaenthusiast.  The second person I reached out to didn't reply, but I will have another round tomorrow.  Thanks!	1402064100.0

t3_235keb	1397619578.0	thedudethedudegoesto		[Offer] I was gifted a card from /u/Dranai , but since I'm in Canada, I cannot use it.	Hello again, here's the story. /u/Dranai was kind enough to send me the info for a dominos gift card, but I can't order online with it. After spending a good 20 minutes looking for change in my house, I finally found 50 cents and walked to a payphone to make my order. The person on the phone told me I couldn't order a pizza without the physical card.  I messaged Dranai back, asking what they suggest should be done, but they haven't answered.   I'm a pretty depressed person, and I've been having a really rough time lately. It felt really nice to get pizza'd, even though dominos crushed that for me. So I'm thinking it will put a smile on my face to re gift the card to someone else.   I guess just PM me, and first person will get the card. Remeber to thank user Dranai, and not me. Seriously, make sure you thank them.

t3_21oyfi	1396122783.0	flobin	pizza	[Offer] Buy a pizza with bitcoin!	Ever since I saw /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, Iâve wanted to buy an internet stranger a pizza. But, mostly due to the fact that I live in the Netherlands and most reddit users live in the US, Iâve never been able to.   Until now! Why? Because of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a decentralised, digital, peer-to-peer currency. Thatâs a lot of mumbo-jumbo, but this means that I can send you bitcoin to pay for your pizza, or pay for your pizza with bitcoin.  So, basically, the offer is such: You either have or create a bitcoin wallet, which I will send one pizza worth of bitcoin to, or you order a pizza with bitcoin and I will fulfill the transaction.  Europeans are in luck, one of the largest takeaway companies accepts bitcoin! [Thuisbezorgd](http://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/) in the Netherlands, [Takeaway.com](http://www.takeaway.com/) in the UK, or any of the [other websites they have](http://corporate.takeaway.com/). (Apparently theyâre even active in [Vietnam](http://www.vietnammm.com/)). Americans, Iâm not sure what options there are for you guys, but check out [coinmap](http://coinmap.org/) to see if a place near you accepts bitcoin, or [pizzaforcoins.com](http://pizzaforcoins.com/) (although I have no idea if that website is legit or not).  Never heard of bitcoin? Donât know what it is, or how to create a wallet? No problem! Check out https://bitcoin.org/en/ and/or /r/bitcoin. You can create a wallet with [electrum](https://electrum.org/), or [coinbase](https://coinbase.com/) or [bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) or many other options, some of which are listed [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet).

t3_21i9kb	1395930860.0	nlevesque3	pizzapimp	[Offer] Pizza goes to the BEST SOB STORY. Because I can decide what I spend my money on, and this is what I decided.	If you give me the best sob story, I will get you a pizza.  Edit: This is not a joke post related to the meta post about this subreddit being too charity-driven. ([This one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/21gib5/metathe_typical_once_a_month_this_is_suppose_to/)) I really will give pizza to the best sob story, based on my judgement.   This "random contest" will end tomorrow at noon. Reply with stories before then :)  **EDIT2**: Hey guys, so I read through the stories added so far, and I honestly don't think I can pick. There's a lot of really sad stuff that's happened to a lot of people, and I can't just pick 1 thing as the 'best' thing and get them pizza. I don't want that responsibility. I know I said I would pick the best sob story, but I would rather do this: YOU guys decide. On top of that, I want to try to help as many people as I can,  so I will get the **TOP 3 UPVOTED STORIES** a pizza.  You guys can pick the saddest story that has the most proof, the funniest story that is obviously fake, the funniest story that seems true, the saddest story regardless of truth. Whatever you want. I'm sorry that I am changing what I originally said, but I *really* did not expect this many people to share this many stories. So PLEASE, go through and vote on the stories. At exactly NOON tomorrow, I will take the TOP 3 stories and give them pizza.  If you feel like helping out somebody in this thread that didn't make the top 3, please do so. It's your money and you can do whatever you want to do with it, so please don't think I am pressuring you or trying to guilt you into doing so.  **EDIT3**: About an hour and a half left. To clarify: Winners will be highest upvotes, not net votes (to discourage downvoting other stories)  **LAST EDIT**: Hey everyone! Contest is over, and I have PMed the winners. This was quite an experience, and I'm sorry I couldn't help everyone :( I'll try to stay more active on this subreddit in the future (that stupid life thing gets in the way of my reddit time). THANKS to everyone that posted a story, real or fake. 	1396022388.0
t3_21hnfl	1395907183.0	OlfactoriusRex	FAP	[Offer] I'll check back in a few hours and buy the winner pizza for lunch.	As I mentioned in my previous submission, I got a new job and I now have to pack up and move to a very rural part of Alaska (where, alas, there is no good pizza to be had). I've got shit like a couch and a car to worry about/deal with, not to mention all the other random crap you'd fill an apartment with.  Most of the stuff I can't take with me, as shipping is outrageous and there are no roads to this new job: you either fly or take a boat, and that's all too slow and too expensive to bother with.  So: suggest ways to make the move as easy as PIE (get it?!) Clever ways to sell stuff easily? Smart lifehacks I might not have thought of? Suggestions on where I can find a cheap place to park my car for weeks or months at a time on the cheap? Think of all the crap I'll have to deal with in the coming weeks and give some advice.  If I come back and there are comments from at least 15 users, I'll choose the one I like best and buy you lunch.  (I think the best way to do it is to have you write in the name of your favorite pizza place, your preferred order, and who's name it should be under. Then I can call it in and you can pick it up and/or call yourself and have them deliver).   Let's see if this works!  EDIT: Pizza delivered! It was a false start at first with a gent from Dublin that I just couldn't get in touch with (my fault and my phone plan's lack of international calling). But the pizza has been delivered and I feel great about it!	1396030976.0

t3_21c6ne	1395769098.0	alexborowski		[Offer] Moving countries next week, went to my favorite burrito place one last time, they changed to cash only but random stranger paid for my meal. Wanted to pay it forward.	Feeling generous and kind of guilty about accepting a meal from a stranger, so I wanted to pay it forward quick. I can't afford too much because I'm moving soon and trying to keep money tight for that, but I'll grab a pizza for the first person to promise me they'll pay it forward as soon as they're able, and if you let me know about it on reddit when it happens, you will warm my heart :). Gotta love random acts of pizza (or burritos).  EDIT: I wish I could buy everyone pizza, but unfortunately I'm trying to be a little frugal for when I move, so the offer is now closed.  Good vibes to everyone and may the random acts of pizza flow freely between us all.  Love y'all.	1395775589.0

Me and the wife received on here a few days ago, and as promised we're paying that forward. Today, we'd like to offer a $20 Dominos gift card to whoever can convince us they deserve it.

t3_20r0cr	1395176011.0	davesmylie		[Offer] Free pizza to the value of about $15 - catch: must have a skrill account	So skrill is being a pita - I have about $US16 in there and want to close the account, but can't cause the minimum amount to transfer out is $15, and the transaction fee to withdraw leaves me $1 too short to withdraw anything.  (I think) I can transfer the money to someone else though for no (or at least a lessor) charge.  The are ignoring my emails, and at the end of this month, they are gonna start charging me $1.75 a month, so I'm just gonna give this away - but you'll need a (free) skrill account for me to do so.  Best/first/funniest/saddest/lamest sob story gets the pizza (or at least how ever much money I can transfer out of the account). No guarantees that this will work as I've never tried to pay anyone from a skrill account before!)

Here is the catch. I wanna see your hidden, known, or maybe strange talents. Maybe you can draw, sing, play an instrument, turn yourself into a human pretzel or do push-up hand stands?   Whatever it is you can do, show me and I'll leave this open for submissions until 16:30 CST (4:30 PM CST). Around that time (I have a formation to catch so forgive me if I'm late) I'll pick a winning so you can eat your pizza for dinner.. or whatever.   Ready, go!    (Also, if you know where flight MH370 is.. you automatically win.)	1395188563.0

t3_20busq	1394729581.0	JonnyB88	pizza	[Offer] $20 E-Card to one of the Big 3 for a US Military Member!	It's past 1800 central, so time for a winner!      /u/Flippy02 has been randomly selected! Congrats! PM incoming, good sir!      /u/rhan1161 will be PMing /u/SeeOfNames  soon as well!         Congrats to the winners and thank you for everyone who has submitted!  As a former BIA, I can't tell you how much you're appreciated!       ____       Just found this sub this week, so I'm hoping I'm doing this properly.       As a veteran, I know that money can be tight, *especially* for military families. So, let me help out with a $20 contribution to your weekend pizza!           ________ **RULES**   **1.** Open to military members only. (Don't worry, I'll do another one within two weeks open to more people, just got a bit of O/T :D )   **2.** Post a picture with some proof of being in the service. (You in uniform, a picture of your CAC with *all* of the PII blocked out, etc).   **2a.** Dependents, feel free to submit too! But, if you submit your dependent ID, ensure you block out the pertinents. Not only is your PII on there, but your sponsor's is too!   **3.** This rule makes me sad that I even have to include it. In the *same* picture from rule #2, show a handwritten piece of paper with your username that you're submitting from. This is to prevent some of the awful people from finding random military pictures online and submitting lies to get free pizza.         ____ Tomorrow, 14 Mar 14, at 1800 central, I'll pick a winner from the submissions. Then, I'll PM you asking which of the big 3 you want, get your e-mail, and send you the e-giftcard.        So, let's get to it!       ____ Note: I have three hopes for this offer.   -To help a serviceman (especially military family) in need of pizza.   -To not have this offer turn into a military/veteran bashfest. We don't take too kindly to that.   -If you fake being in, and manage to fool me, I hope the pizza that I buy you burns the roof of your mouth for being an awful person. :D  	1394838429.0

Your good deed is recognized and very much appreciated.  I will make this offer again in the future.  Congrats to the lucky winner, /u/hello_amy.   = = = = = =   We've seen a lot of requests for pizza where the OP promises to pay it forward after OP receives his/her paycheck on Friday, tax refunds, student loans, etc.  I don't put a lot of faith on this promise since I personally have seen very few redditors actually kept this promise.  So I'd like to thank and acknowledge those who have received pizza from this RAOP sub and then came back to gift pizza to someone else.  **This offer is for those redditors who have received pizza in the past and then came back to gift someone else pizza.  This offer is for this sub /u/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza only.**  There's a similar offer on the other sub.  Rules:  1.  Post a link to your original pizza request (link #1)  2.  Post a link of you offering or gifting someone else pizza (link #2).  This link can be your offer post (preferred), a thank you post from the receiver, or a screenshot of your PM to the mods.  3.  Unless it's obvious, you have to show me that you gave pizza AFTER you have received one.  I'll pick a winner on Saturday 3/8/14.  Pizza $20 eCard (big 3 chains) for US winner.

t3_1zpbzy	1394091567.0	Whisperers	Whisperers	[Offer] $20 Gift Card if you have made a Thank You post	This offer is for a $20 gift card to any one of the big 3 that the chosen person chooses. I will be doing this again in the future. My reason for doing this is twofold. Firstly, i hope it will encourage people to post 'Thank You' posts in the future because it's the very least you can do if you have been gifted and it costs you nothing to make a Thank You post. Secondly, because i hope to make this a regular thing when i'm in a position to, it will hopefully also encourage people to not delete their posts. (As those posts will be needed in order to enter). So for you to be eligible for this offer, you must go through your history and find a Thank You post you made for someone who gifted you pizza in **THIS** sub and post the link to it in this post. (Only post one). Thank You posts from any other sub **WILL NOT** count so please don't post any. I will choose randomly Friday evening UK time. (To give you an idea of the time, it is Thursday 7.40am UK time at the time of me making this post.) I will then message the person i choose and await their reply stating which pizza place they would like the gift card for.   **Remember, NO Thank you posts from other subs will count. ONLY THIS SUB**  EDIT: No idea why the post is orange instead of green as it is an offer and not a Thank you post? Unless it's because i used the words Thank you in the title.  2nd EDIT: This is for US residents only.  3rd EDIT: I chose /u/cyndikins. I have messaged them and i am awaiting their reply to which of the big 3 they would like their gift card for. Would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who takes the time to make 'Thank You' posts once they have been gifted. It's a small gesture but it goes a long way :)	1394224457.0

t3_1t3fvs	1387296315.0	merrybitcoin	JohnGalt1337	[Offer] Merry Bitcoin! Who could use a little help or a good sandwich?	Some friends and I are using a great new service known as [Gyft.com](http://www.gyft.com) that allows for the easy buying and sending of gift cards, and, happens to accept the wonderful currency [Bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin) as payment. We've loaded our account up with gift cards to Burger King, Amazon, CVS, and all sorts of places (Photo: http://i.imgur.com/En9jUQT.jpg), and we'd like to help those who could use it most during this holiday season.  If you could use a nice sandwich, or anything else we may be able to help with, we'll try our best to help those who need it most for as long as we can.  We'll be posting here and on a couple other subreddits, we'll be contributing at least 1 Bitcoin of our own money to start, and for anyone interested in contributing I posted a separate thread on the Bitcoin subreddit that can be found here: [Merry Bitcoin! - Giving Back For the Holidays](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1t4jg2/bitcoin_christmas_has_officially_begun_using/), and hopefully if others donate we can keep this going even longer, and help even more people.  Happy Holidays everyone, and Merry Bitcoin!  Edit: For anyone who'd like to join us: [Take a Look Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1t4jg2/bitcoin_christmas_has_officially_begun_using/) and we'll go till we're out of money :)  Update Dec 17th, 11:30PM EST - So far we've heard from 100's of people and have been able to help well over 50+ who needed it most. We'll continue till we're out of funds, we'd hoped that others would contribute to the holiday so it could last as long as possible, but it seems it may be only my friends and I. Either way, we'll try our best to help those who really need it till we're out of funds, take care and happy holidays :)  Update: Dec 18th, 1:30PM EST - We're back, and the mods have been nice enough to sticky our post for us, let's help some more people today.

Happy Holidays everyone.  Update: Dec 19th, 8PM EST, We'll be back soon, and hopefully the admins here can continue to pin our post, we were able to help a lot more people today, here's an update from today: http://i.imgur.com/GjRt0Hp.jpg  Update: Dec 20th, 7:26AM EST, We'll be trying to help as many people as we can today, yesterday we received our first few donations from strangers to the Bitcoin address we've setup for Merry Bitcoin which can be found here: [1MzUXkMbXFopNdhfidcEVQbBpudN6e9Ypi](https://blockchain.info/address/1MzUXkMbXFopNdhfidcEVQbBpudN6e9Ypi), including a generous donation of more than $200 from a kind stranger. We'll try to help as many people as possible until we're out of funds :) Merry Bitcoin everyone!  Update: Dec 20th, 7:15PM EST, We've now helped over 100+ people who could use it, hopefully the mods can keep our post pinned and we'll keep going till we're out of funds :) Happy Holidays everyone!

t3_1rjlrz	1385520298.0	Jourdin		[Offer] Thanksgiving pizza, because who needs turkey?	Hey everyone! A few months ago, I won a $10 e-gift card to Papa John's (from a nomination in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1jcpu7/offerus_pizza_for_you_and_someone_else/)), but I still haven't used it. I want to keep the giving going and figured this is a good time of year to do it! Ideally I would like to give to someone who is struggling this Thanksgiving and may not have much of a meal for the holiday, but if you just need a pizza to cheer you up because your relatives suck or you think Christopher Columbus was an asshole and want to celebrate the holiday your own way, that's okay too!  Like I said the gift card is for $10. That's just enough to buy their large one-topping special offer pizza, so that's what I'll be buying.  Finally, I doubt they actually deliver/are open on Thanksgiving, so I will probably have to buy the pizza the day before or after.  Happy holidays :)  Edit: Offer closed! Didn't expect this many responses, so I'm trying to figure out how to pick a winner. You all deserve it, though, I wish I could buy you all pizzas!  Edit again: Okay, I decided to pick two winners. I used a randomizer. I will PM the two winners first and then post here once they've been confirmed. Thanks everyone for participating and I hope you all have a wonderful holiday.  Edit *again*: /u/Loincloth_COYS has messaged me upon deciding to match my offer, **plus two**!. So now ~~FOUR~~ **SIX!!** people will be getting Thanksgiving pizzas. All because I had one measly e-card to give away :') This makes me so happy. The other ~~2~~ 4 winners have been randomly chosen and are in the process of being messaged. I will update with all ~~4~~ 6 usernames as soon as everyone has responded. There may be some communication delay, so some pizzas may not come until Friday or Saturday, unless nearby pizza places are open on Thanksgiving (and let's hope not - those folks deserve the day off). --- As you can see I made another edit, because /u/Loincloth_COYS has decided to give away four pizzas instead of just two. All of this kindness is just blowing me away.	1385609716.0

t3_1l1tfu	1377424541.0	spacitymedic	shroom	[Offer] Not a pizza, but its all I have to give. Two $10 gift certificate Restaurant.com	For a long time now, I have wanted to pizza someone. I came on here and joined immediately after seeing something about RAOP on tv, and though I didn't understand the rules here, I asked right out for a pizza because I was so desperately hungry. A few short hours after joining, a soldier in Japan sent a hungry homeless part time firefighter a pizza. Pizza never tasted so good!  So, though I am really struggling right now, and I am personally in need of some assistance, I want to give the only thing I have to give right now. I have two ten dollar gift certificates to Restaurant.com. Now, I know it's not a pizza, but it's something. To use the codes, you just have to go to the website, create an account, and enter the codes to claim the money to a restaurant of your choice. You usually have to spend 15 dollars to use the ten dollar coupon, but hey, you're only out five bucks.  So... maybe you're not completely destitute, like I was the two times I posted on here... and you do have some money to spend, but it's just not enough. I want to help you.  AAAALL that being said, post a few paragraphs telling me about your struggle. In it, also tell me about what you are currently doing to improve your situation. Whoever two people show they are making the best effort to overcome their obstacles gets one of the coupons.    I really do hope to help someone with an actual pizza soon, but in the mean time, this can help someone out there!  Bless you all!  Love, Desiree

t3_1jp0fu	1375644383.0	punisherranger		[Offer] Free Pizza to DC Firefighters, PD, Nurses, etc...	I wanted to do something nice for people working hard on Sunday in Washington, D.C. If you are a nurse, police officer, firefighter, EMT, etc.. working today, let me know and I'll send a pizza to your place. No need to verify so long as the address is something legit. Just post a pic of you guys enjoying it.	
t3_1jolku	1375630198.0	jackelfrink	pizza	[Offer] $10 PizzaHut eCard to the first time-stamped pic of a red clothes button with exactly two holes.	I have a leftover eCard to PizzaHut that is going unused. This seems like a fun way to distribute it.	
t3_1jnx49	1375589312.0	celticbinne	pizza	[Offer] I really want to buy some pizza for 3 different people here (story inside).	Well, this exact time last year I was couch surfing. I left my hometown the day after graduation to get the hell out of dodge and started college in the beginning of the summer. I got a job as soon as I got here and came to love/hate my co-workers. The majority of them graduated (I'll be a sophomore in the fall) but they really helped me out. I had to send home every dollar possible and I wasn't able to pay for my own living or food expenses. My dad is 65 and disabled so he really had no source of income.  Now, I'm about to get a promotion and am in line for an internship (I had to pass up in the Spring because of money issues..) and a kick ass second job in the fall. Not to mention ROTC really had my back.  So why 3? Well I could bombard someone with 60$ or so worth of pizza. But I had three friends in particular who didn't ask for ANYTHING in return and really helped me out when I was in a bad state. Think of this as me paying it forward and I expect you to do the same. It would be awesome to have 3 people do the same to another person and have a ripple effect.  I'm in the US and it'd be easiest for me to order it for you to pick-up, to have it delivered to your address or a building close by if you're on a campus or something of the sort.   If not I can send an eGift Card but then your order is kind of capped, for example you want two medium pies and bread sticks but it's $24 and I sent you $20.   I'm just looking for someone who is genuine and will do this for someone else as soon as they can. Whether they got short-changed this paycheck, moved to a new town, or whatever the case I know how helpless you feel. Some pizza and good friends helped me out WAY more than you can imagine. Oh and since it's 12AM here (everywhere delivers until 4AM here) if you can't get it tonight, I can order it for you for lunch/dinner/late tomorrow if that works.  EDIT: Orders are being sent, I hope everyone pays it forward! * /u/Kicken is getting a medium 2-topping, breadsticks and large cheese pizza  * /u/DownByLaw524 is getting a medium 2-topping and cheesy bread * /u/juhlee is getting a large cali chicken bacon ranch  I hope you all enjoy! :) pleaseeee pay it forward guys, really, it makes a difference.	1375594390.0
t3_1jnrzp	1375583871.0	harrisonfire	harrisonfire	[Offer] Pizza.	To any redditor with a 2+ year account, for any reason.   PM me details.  Edit: offer will probably end at ~12:00 AM EST Second edit: an active account.  Take care, people! Edit: WHY is it so hard to send pizza sometimes?!  Talked with multiple people, no pizza sent :(  Final edit: sent two pies in the U.S. and one to a good person in Australia. I'm going to try to send one more, and that's it.   Over.

t3_1jn5bk	1375561017.0	TheGreatZarquon	pizza	[Offer] Fortune smiled upon me, and I have an extra $14 in my bank account.	After paying the bills and getting some groceries, I have extra $14 in my bank account. I just quit smoking, and I figure that the best way to make sure I stay on the bandwagon is to use what would have been cigarette money to get one of you a pizza.      So, if I can get a pizza for you for $14 or less, lemme know. I know $14 won't cover a huge pizza, but I'd rather feed someone than buy a pack of smokes.      Edit: Ok dudes, currently holding a PM conversation with the person I'll hopefully be buying pizza for. I guess until further notice, this offer is closed. To those of you still wanting a pizza, remember that this is the kindest subreddit around, so hopefully you won't be waiting much longer. Also, thanks for the kind wishes in my battle against smoking, I really appreciate it.      Double edit: Offer is officially closed.	1375569894.0

The turkey guy was so going to be the lucky random 3rd winner, but my sister no crap just came and asked for a huge loan O.o**  So sorry I could only do one extra random bonus pizza. Until next time :)  Edit: OR DOMINOS, since someone said there is no Papa Johns near them.       I don't know if I am asking to much or just wording it wrong. Please reference my reply to                  /u/WhosThatGuru_V2       >Just asking someone to take a picture of something interesting, funny, anything with their username in the            picture? (i.e. on a piece of paper) That is a lot for a free pizza?     I.E. If you think you have a cool car, a picture with your username is a lot? You think your hair is looking          good today, a shot of that with your username on a piece of paper is asking a lot for a pie?      Hopefully that clears things up, I wanted to make it easy, I just listed stuff I like in case you had something.          Lets say you have a Yu Darvish (Texas Ranger) K counter bobblehead, a picture of that with your username      would suffice.       Maybe you have a cool T Swizzle poster hanging in your room... etc.   I will pick a winner by 7PM CST. If you win, I will need your phone #, address (to locate a papa johns via their site) and name to place on the order. So make sure there is a papa johns that you can pick up at.   You will also need to use the verification system linked on the sidebar.   So, whoever post something that catches my eye. If it is a picture, it must have your username shown and todays date (not photoshopped on), if it is a video (lets say a funny Vine) you must state your name or have a sign with your username on it with todays date.  So please post something random, funny, and SFW.   That is all. PS I love   Edit: The items listed below are things I enjoy. So posting a picture involving one of the things below would most likely have me favoring your picture or video over someone who does not have one of the item in their submission. Even if you don't have one of the 5 things listed below, you still have a good chance of winning :) These are just things I like, nothing more, you don't have to involve them in your submission.       1. T Swizzle (Taylor Swift)      2. Frank Sinatra     3. Texas Rangers     4. Cubs     5. Running  Edit: I a word 	1375489992.0

Doesn't need to be professional, or even tattoo-able. Just a rough sketch will do.

t3_1izxkz	1374715691.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] It's my cake day! Let's celebrate...	**CONTEST OVER**  Please read the entire post.  I'm not going to feel bad about disqualifying invalid entries.  I'm asking people to draw celebratory pictures, involving cake in some (SFW) way.  Here's how prizes will work:  - prize is a $10 US egift card to pizza hut, domino's, or papa john's, your choice.  - the first 3 acceptable (by my judgement... basically look like you spent more than 2 minutes of effort on it.  crappy art is ok [seriously, i'm bad at drawing too] but a simple circle labeled "cake" is not) drawings get a $10 card  - the 2 best drawings (as judged by me) by midnight EST tonight (~2.5 hours from now) get a $10 card.  - people are allowed to win in both categories  - one entry per person.  no editing your post to update your drawing (or as a placeholder).  any posts with the edit mark (or that I happen to catch being ninja edited) are disqualified.  that means don't edit for stupid things like spelling, etc. too, because i have no way to distinguish.  - BONUS: each entrant can PM me one guess (only one) as to why I rarely eat cake.  if you are correct AND you otherwise won a prize in one of the categories above, you get $2 extra on your card.  - must have had reddit account for at least 2 months with some minimal level of activity (my discretion), or for 1 month with a significant level of activity (again my discretion).  really good art may get an exception, but don't count on it.  **CLOSED**  Thanks everyone!  I hope nobody minds, but I decided to just give a $10 card each to all the entries (except the nsfw one, sorry :-/, and $12 to the one that guessed right that I don't eat eggs) instead of trying to judge them because I like them all and this way more people get pizza!  If anyone feels strongly offended/bothered that I changed it up like that, talk to me and we'll figure something out :)  **UPDATE** oops, didn't notice that the person who guessed correctly didn't actually submit an entry, so it'll just be 5 $10 cards	1374726579.0
t3_1ixnyv	1374638828.0	x_driven_x	pizza-gold	[Offer] Pizza for a Single Parent	**Edit 1: Thursday 3:48pm CST** - Winner chosen and contacted (sorry a day late!) thank you ALL for submitting!!!! Additionally, I have sent "promises to pizza" to a couple of posters that I intend to keep as soon as I get paid again! Thank you all for posting and I appreciate each and every one of you!  My mother was single until I was 9, and only closer to adulthood did I find out that sometimes she just didn't eat to be able to afford even simple things like milk for me when I was very young. She was, and still is, a great mother.  I'd like to buy pizza for a single parent (mom or dad!). Maybe it will help lighten your expenses for a night and/or provide a nice treat for the kid(s) or at the very least give you a night off of cooking!  There's really no other rules for entry, and I will choose 1 person Wednesday to be the winner. I am pretty busy tomorrow, so you might not actually get the gift certificate until Thursday, but I'll do my best!  Recipient will be chosen by me based upon my own criteria for selecting 1 parent from all submitters, and I apologize in advice for all the single parents I can't give pizzas to (I wish I could!!!)  Good Luck, and know your kid will (hopefully) grow up to appreciate all your hard work, and can still be successful, despite what some rude people would say!!! :) 	1374785911.0

So yeah. No made up sob story, no bullshit, just greasy goodness from the big three. Lunch ain't for a while, and dinner ain't for longer, so I'll pick someone randomly at around 1PM CDT.

t3_1hlk0m	1372892047.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] Been a while since I've done a game...	**PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE POST BEFORE ENTERING**  Let's have some fun with a sociopolitical experiment.  Hopefully I won't offend anyone with my terminology.  If you are eligible (see rules), enter by posting something funny (keep it SFW) as a reply here to my "reply to this to enter" post.  At the same time send me a PM with your choice of what you will do if you win (option 1, 2, or 3).  ---- **Mechanics**  - You are entering the pizza lottery.  5 winners will be selected.  Winners start with a $10 pizza prize.  - Winners can choose from 3 options for their prize:  1. Enjoy their newfound and well-earned pizza riches (keep the entire $10) 2. Share some of their newfound wealth. (keep $5) 3. Be really generous and give away ALL their newfound wealth (keep $0)  * Being generous pays dividends to the community.  The spirit of giving results in (virtual) others sharing as well, with the following consequences:  1. If you choose option 2 above (sharing half your riches), that multiplies to a $10 card for someone in the community (randomly chosen from the entire pool of entrants, could possibly be you), in addition to the $5 that you're keeping.   (So $15 total for the community) 2. If you choose option 3 above (sharing ALL your riches), those turn into 2 $10 cards for random (could potentially be you) people in the community.  (So $20 total for the community but none guaranteed to you)  * The lottery drawings will be made whenever I get a chance after 11:59pm EST on July 4th.  Entry is open until I gather them together for the drawing, but enter early to be safe.  Results will be announced shortly thereafter.  ---- **Rules**  - What you post doesn't actually matter, I just say post something funny so everyone can get something out of it.  Selections will be random, not based on content of post or votes.  * Unlike some of my contests, discussion (of strategy or otherwise) is welcome and encouraged  * Prizes will be awarded in the form of an eGift Card to your choice of Pizza Hut, Domino's, or Papa John's  * To be eligible you must:  1. be in the US (or willing to accept a US eGift Card as a prize)  2. have been a Redditor for at least 4 months 3. have at least 100 total (comment+link) karma 4. have a reasonable amount of activity in non-assistance subreddits (reasonable is based on my discretion and I will be happy to make exceptions for those whose primary activity is on assistance subreddits but is in the form of providing assistance too, not just requesting.  basically, don't only be here for getting stuff, be giving back to or participating in the reddit community in some way too) 5. Only one entry per person please.  Don't use multiple accounts  * Results will be announced publicly (probably as an update in this post) so people can have fun with the data.  I will try to do my best to anonymize the choices while still providing a winners list and interesting data, but in case I fail in that please don't harass people for their choices, as that will make me less willing to do these in the future.  (And if you get harassed you should definitely report it to the mods)  * People will be disqualified if I have reason to believe they haven't read the entire post (that's mostly from not following instructions).  * No whining about the rules.  If you don't like it, don't participate.  Constructive critiquing about the setup is welcome though.  * I reserve the right to add written or unwritten rules as the need arises.  **SERIOUSLY PEOPLE, READ THE ENTIRE POST.  TWO ENTRIES SO FAR AND BOTH MANAGED TO SHOW THEY HAVEN'T READ EVERYTHING**  ----  **REALLY, READ IT**  ----  **BTW, DID I MENTION?  READ THE ENTIRE POST PLEASE!**  ----  **I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENOUGH BOLD TEXT THAT I'M NOT GOING TO FEEL BAD ABOUT SILENTLY IGNORING ENTRIES AFTER THIS THAT DIDN'T READ.  EVERYONE UP 'TIL NOW GETS A HEADS-UP VIA PM**  ----  **UPDATE:**  As of ~5:50pm EST there are only 7 or 8 valid entries (depending on which way I go on the eligibility of one of them).  If I don't have at least 10 valid entries by the time the contest closes, I intend to reduce the number of prizes to floor(n/2) where n is the number of valid entries.  People upvoting for visibility, and those who entered double-checking that they followed everything the post said (I'm being lenient about timing so they can still fix it) would help make sure we get to 10 valid entries and can have the maximum number of prizes.  ----  **UPDATE:**  The contest is closed.  There were only 9 valid entries in the end, so 4 prizes.  Winners of the primary and secondary drawings have been notified.  I will update later (probably in about a day) with interesting stats (too tired now).  ----  **RESULTS UPDATE:**  Of the entries that sent me an option choice, they were pretty evenly split between option 1 and option 3.  (4 for option 1, 5 for option 3, 1 for option 2).  I was honestly expecting a lot more people to pick option 2.  There were 12 attempted entries before the deadline.  Surprisingly to me, they were all from people who met the karma/age/activity requirements (one was borderline but I allowed it).  3 were ultimately disqualified for not following what the post said.  I PMed a few of the early ones and most of them fixed it, but some didn't even after being notified (I didn't tell them what was wrong).  And one deleted his/her entry altogether, not sure why.   Anyways, that left 9 valid contestants, so in accordance with my updated rule there were 4 lottery winners.  With the contestants numbered 1-9:  The lottery winners were contestants 1, 7, 3, and 8.  Contestants 1 and 3 chose option 1 and kept their $10.  Contestants 7 and 8 had chose option 3.  In the drawing for contestant 7's re-shared cards, contestants 2 and 5 got them.  In the drawing for contestant 8's re-shared cards, contestant 8 got one of them back, and contestant 2 won a second card.  The people who ended up getting pizza were destinyisntfree, angelamm10, Weldhelmet, chhill2, and bileybegia.  In addition, rackpuppy won the drawing but didn't end up getting any pizza.  Papa John's was the clear favorite with 3 of the pizza recipients choosing it, and there was 1 each for Pizza Hut and Domino's.	1373175116.0
t3_1hlagq	1372884319.0	curlingblue	pizza	[OFFER] Medium two-topping pan pizza from Domino's (carryout only)	So because Homer Bailey threw a no-hitter last night AND I'm an MLB.TV subscriber, I got a code from Domino's for a free two-topping medium pizza for carryout.

t3_1hil2c	1372792816.0	plastic_apollo	FAP	[OFFER]You want a pizza, I need photoshop skills for a birthday surprise! Let's make a trade!	My fiance's birthday is coming up (mid-July); he's always gotten a laugh out of the "three wolf moon" meme and subsequent versions of the shirt ([here's the original for reference](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ANCwQnIjL._SX342_.jpg)). I asked him if he'd ever actually wear one, and he said he would....if it was our dog.   [So here's our dog!](http://imgur.com/a/HI9od)  I need your help to create a "Three Eskie Moon" shirt. In that album are three pictures of our dog, an American Eskimo named Albus. I need someone, using photoshop, to cut out those three pics of him as best as possible and photoshop it onto the space/moon background, then upload it to imgur in a high res version. I will then have this printed onto a shirt to surprise (dismay?) him on his birthday. The best part is that he swore that, if he ever got such a shirt, he would wear it to work. Knowing that we don't have Photoshop nor do I know how to use it, he probably figured he was safe.  It's a lot to ask, so I'm offering pizza for your help. The person who makes the 'shop that makes me laugh the most will get a digital giftcard to one of the top 3 (Domino's, PJ's, or PH) of their choice.   PS: You can get creative with the shop, too. It doesn't have to be that specific moon background.   It's about 3:30 EST where I'm at, so I'll let this run until tomorrow morning (July 3), at which point I'll contact the winner and hook them up with pizza by 3 p.m. Thanks RAoP!  **EDIT: I just realized a more appropriate tag would have been [CONTEST]. Whoops! Sorry mods!**  **EDIT2: WE HAVE A WINNER!!!! I wish I could give a pizza to every single one of you that contributed a photoshop of our dog. I have been laughing non-stop since I started this thread, but ultimately, the cheesey prize goes to u/Incoherentrant, [whose rendition of Three Eskie Moon](http://i.imgur.com/0HGbVEh.jpg) has kept me laughing for hours now. SCAMMERS BEWARE: I've already e-mailed Incoherentrant with the giftcard before making this announcement, so don't bother messaging me to steal pizza. Thanks everyone! I can't wait for the T-shirt to come in!**	1372878717.0

I'm feeling fine and a bit overwhelmed by the outpouring of support but I ask you to redirect it to others. I've been saying this to a few people already but radiate positivity.

The world needs more love and you should give it.   **EDIT4** Things are dying down here... now especially with what's going on in Oklahoma. Or simply because interest has weened....

t3_1eft0w	1368688767.0	garbleman	pizza	[Thanks] to zhemor, my boyfriend and I discovered the ambrosia of pizza!	zhemor posted an [offer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1e270d/offer_feeling_kinda_bummed/) involving couples and corgies. With the gift certificate she generously sent me (plus $8 and tip), I was able to get [a veritable feast of deliciousity](http://imgur.com/a/9pqB3) for my boyfriend and myself! The haul: two pizzas for us to share (both with sausage and mushroom, one hand-tossed with regular sauce, one pan with extra white sauce), a pasta bowl and soda for him, and two of those little chocolate lava cakes so we could each try one.  Since the video I included with my story involved [a corgi and some very special mushrooms](http://youtu.be/jL18kdFYITg?t=16s), it seemed natural that we got mushrooms on both pizzas.  It was through this that we discovered the *ambrosia* of the pizza gods:  * Dominos pan pizza * Extra White (alfredo) Sauce * Sausage and Mushrooms  Oh  my  god.  You have to try it! It is unbelievably good! I have the feeling that this pizza will one day factor into a successful peace treaty in some war-torn part of the world. Mark my words, people! The lava cakes were surprisingly good too, but just good good, not ambassador for the greater good good.  Thank you very much again to zhemor for giving us both a fun treat and one less thing to worry about in the midst of all of this exciting chaos!	
t3_1eevsj	1368657167.0	x_driven_x	pizza-gold	[Offer] [US] Just paid off all my credit cards, time to celebrate! Best tattoo/piercing pic wins! Details inside.	I've given away $75 in pizza over the last week, but I just paid off all of my credit cards today and want to celebrate again!  I will give away 1 e-card to one of the big 3, most likely Domino's unless you really need something else... to the person who posts my favorite tattoo and/or piercing pic. The gift card will be at least $10, but no more than $25, though most likely will be $25.  I only have 1 tattoo myself, but I really dig good tattoos and piercings.  **Rules:**   I will pick a favorite based on my own liking. I will most likely not pick your submission if its not original content (i.e. some random pic off the internet), for the best chance post a pic of your own tattoo/piercing. I may take other posters comments into consideration, but the final decision will be my own.  I will accept PM submissions, but please post in the thread that you are submitting PM, so I can reply to something publicly should I choose you as a winner.  **Timeframe:**  I plan to pick a winner sometime Thursday (5/16) late afternoon-ish, and send the gift card out Thursday evening as soon as proper communication can be made.  Good Luck!  **Edit 1:** keep them coming, im really enjoying the sumbissions do far! A winner won't be picked until Thursday afternoon US time. Also, I've decided to add a 2nd prize also in the $10-$25 range. One prize will go to my favorite tattoo, one to my favorite piercing, with the overall favorite taking 1st prize. Yes, it may be possible for one submission to win both, but that might be a hard feat to accomplish!  **Edit 2:** It's afternoon where I am, and I've chosen the winners! I decided to award my favorite tattoo with a $25 gift card, and my favorite piercing also with a $25 gift card. And I will be awarding 2nd place in each category with $10 gifts. Winners to be contact soon to arrange award. I will update later with names of winners! Thank you all so much for participating and your submissions, they were all enjoyable and made it a hard decision (hence the extra awards!)  **Edit 3:** Winners are below. $95+ in pizza given out... I say + because one winner is in another country and I don't know how much the transaction is going to cost me yet :) Oh well, enjoy the pizza guys and gals!

t3_1dtw31	1367887114.0	robertgentel		[OFFER] [MULTIPLE] [PIZZA PARTIES] It's Nurses Week (6th-12th) and I got my company to buy nurses and their coworkers a pizza party in 14 different cities across the US this week, two a day! Please help get the word to nurses you know, and if you can buy them a pizza on your own because nurses rock!	I know you all have other important links to get to on reddit so here are the details:  http://www.nursingjobs.us/blog/nurses-week-2013-pizza/  Mods: I did read the sidebar to see if this kind of thing (marketing, even if it uses pizza) is allowed and couldn't tell if it was not. If it is proscribed and I have demonstrated insufficient reading comprehension, consider the bad entirely mine.  Please let any nurses you know (on reddit, sure, but even on /r/outside) and help us spread this tradition by considering a nurse this week as the object of your pizza-affection. Nurses do a lot of difficult, dirty work. Dangerous sometimes and other than this one week a year, definitely under-appreciated. They save lives every day and may one day save yours or someone you love. That earns at the very least a free pizza every now and then in my book and this subreddit helped inspire me to get my company to try to "make this a thing" for nurses every year during Nurses Week. If you think it's worthy I think it can happen (my company is a small business, but we'll try to do more each year).  TLDR: we will give two pizza parties away per day. One on our Facebook account and one one our Twitter account. We will only deliver to nurses working on-duty to share with their co-workers (i.e. to a hospital nursing unit) so please don't try to steal nurse pizza during Nurses Week reddit! I know you guys won't, but maybe other less-noble subreddits you share this with (please spread the word and buy a nurse a pizza) might!  * https://www.facebook.com/nursingjobs.us - we have a bunch of followers here in an explosion of fans recently, will be harder to get pizza to be honest with you, not that we don't want you as fans anyway!) * https://twitter.com/nursingjobsinus - (we had fewer than 100 followers this morning, and this is a much better chance for pizza, just saying)  Edit: formatting?

t3_1d09kw	1366809325.0	Bete-Noire	PIF	[Offer] UK only. Random number between 1-100.	Hey guys,  I've been "pizza'd" twice now so thought it was about time I payed it forward! I'm in the UK so can't gift card or anything so you'd have to be OK with giving me your deets, and then hopefully not get asked for the card upon delivery (anyone know any way around this?).  Anyway, I used a random number generator to find a number between 1 - 100, and whoever comments here first with the same number can have anything up to Â£15 from Domino's or Pizza Hut or justeat.co.uk or something.   If no one has guessed the correct number by 19:00 I'll pick whoever's closest!  Good luck :)   Edit: Just thought I'd do an edit to let you all know I'm keeping an eye on this, and I'll let the winner know by 7pm.  **EDIT 2: Wow, thanks everyone for responding and I wish I could afford more than one pizza :( it's 7pm and no one guessed the exact number but someone was only one digit off so I'm going to PM them now and if they don't respond within the hour I'll update again.**  **EDIT 3: I feel bad for them but the one digit off winner didn't respond to three messages over an hour and a half so I've messaged the next closest person!**  EDIT 4: Well I never knew how hard it would be to give pizza away! The initial winner never responded to my messages, so after 1.5 hours I moved on to the runner up who after half an hour declined the offer as he already ate, so I messaged the NEXT runner up nearly an hour ago and he hasn't responded either and now I feel like it's getting pretty late for pizza?! I'm gonna give this guy another 15 mins and then message the NEXT runner up and see if they still want pizza today and if not see if guy number two wants pizza tomorrow instead :/ Why does no one want pizza?! Haha.  ***LAST EDIT: Finally good news :) After waiting around for anyone to get back to me the initial winner showed up and was still hungry for pizza! The random number generated when I posted this afternoon was 59 and no one got that but the winner was /u/Quashiie who guessed 58, and now has a pizza on the way to him/her :)***	1366838920.0

t3_1a8b89	1363199757.0	thetaven	FAP	[offer] (US) First time offering pizza, bear with me!	So, I discovered this subreddit about a month ago, I think.  And although I have made a request once before, I think that my lack of reddit posts and lack of posts in this subreddit specifically may have deterred people away.  So, in addition to my introduction to RAoP, I thought that I could do a giveaway!  **OFFER**  I'm offering one $20 e-giftcard to ONE lucky person! (I think I say that it will be either Papa Johns, Domino's, or Pizza Hut? Correct me if I'm wrong, is that what people mean by "big 3?")  Since I work at subway, post your favorite Subway sandwich order! I'll make the most appealing one as my dinner tonight when I get off, and you will get a pizza!  I should be off approximately 11pm Eastern, so expect an update/edit/whatever it is around that time!  **EDIT**  So, thanks to the Reddit app, I was able to check out replies before getting off, and WOW!  It's nothing stellar, I know, but I feel so cool!  And the lucky person of the day is..... [Jaxie911!](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jaxie911) Thanks to you, I tried my first ever subway melt!  Look for my message arranging everything!  And as to MY favorite sub?  Well, since I eat subway literally daily, I kind of go through phases with it.  Right now I've been rocking a turkey sub on wheat with a little cheddar cheese, cold.  Then every vegetable EXCEPT cucumbers.  Little bit of balsamic vinaigrette, all the shakes, and you're good to go!	1363230678.0

I have a pizza code that expires on the 10th, and I procrastinate. So, one of you lucky ducks can have it :) Not sure how to choose out of the many who respond, so I guess I'll just wing it.  I love to trade, so throw it out there. I don't have video games so free Xbox gold doesn't help. Gift cards/ gift codes are fucking awesome, as I have no credit or debit card. I am especially in love with Amazon, Etsy, and Fab.com. Domino's too.  If one if you happens to have bones, teeth, fur, taxidermy or especially odd things, don't be shy. The weirder the better.  Trade isn't absolutely necessary, just throwing it out there in case something awesome happens.  	1362954603.0
t3_1a03qc	1362881239.0	jaybeebrad	PIF	[OFFER] Pizza for your Praise	Over the holidays someone pizza'd me at a really horrible life moment - actually I had a really rough six months there, and reddit was amazing in general.  I'm not suddenly Mr. Moneybucks, but the time has definitely come for me to return the favor. I thought I'd try to make it fun though. Well, fun for me anyway.  It's 9:00PM Eastern time right now. I will decide on a recipient for a pizza to be delivered *tonight*, and it will be from Papa John's. I have an account with them so I can simply enter your information online and have it sent directly to you. I will make my decision by 11PM my time. If my chosen one doesn't have late PJ's delivery we can pick another time; we can even schedule a future delivery online.  So this is what you have to do: download my music collection or listen to me perform on YouTube and then tell me what you listened to and how amazing I am. :) OR, tell me you think I'm terrible and why. As long as you think I'm pretty.  There is no right or wrong answer. I'll just pick the response I like best!  http://www.youtube.com/beatnickblanket for video https://soundcloud.com/jamesbradford for music (or find me on itunes or Pandora or Spotify or whatever.)  Good luck! My ego thanks you in advance. ;)

t3_19qtnd	1362532101.0	instant_japanese	pizza-gold	[Offer] one last call	I'm about to be too narrow on funds to afford doing one of these for a while so i'm going to offer two ten dollar pizza cards to whomever. Be careful with your choice of company along with how soon you need it. I've found sometimes they show up 15 minutes later and sometimes the people don't see them until the next morning.   This is always a terrible process because i find 10 different people who all say they are hungry but I can only support two. So if you want to do something special to stand out, go ahead. If you aren't chosen, please understand. I'm going to step away for about thirty minutes to let the requests come in and if nothing shows anyone above another i'm just going to buy for the first two requests. Make sure to clarify what joint you want it from.   EDIT IMPORTANT: I got a shit ton of messages in a very short period. So many people who sound hungry and/or interesting that I'm going to spend way more money than I intended to. With this last burst it will truly be my last for a little while. Here are the list of names. All of you msg simply with your email adresses and pizza places of choice. And any other things you promised. hint hint kittens. If I didn't get to you, i'm really sorry. But you have to understand a lot of people want pizza. and spending 50 bucks is really way out of my price range but I thought, shit, most of that money would have went to alcohol anyway. Thanks again.  EMAIL ADDRESS AND PIZZA JOINT OF YOUR CHOICE IN THE MSG PLEASE. Saves lots of trouble. Once again, if one of these 5 does not come through in the next hour they will be placed with the next one up. wub wub wub and pizza.    BOOP BOOP:  BoxedCheese, deeter, and ladydean should all have cards on their way. I never heard back from boner sushi (beautiful name) and I tried to get pizza for blargznoflo from two different places but it kept not accepting my information. i'm assuming something weird is going on with the card. so blargznoflo look forward to a pizza in a day or two and I hope the rest of you enjoyed it. blah blah blah blah. fart. <3	1362536635.0

The ridiculous amount of offer threads are making me so happy that I decided to continue the pizza giving goodness (and hopefully inspire even more giving threads).  BUT... I want something in return.  Art, of any form.  But it needs to be Original Content, and something that you've done specifically for this offer.  Requirements:    1) No limit on the reddit account -- I don't care if you're brand new, or 4 years old.  Everyone can play!!  2) Art of any form -- singing, drawing, interpretive dance, a dessert, etc etc.  Let your artistic talent flow!  3) I don't care if you're the worst artist in the world, can't sing a lick, or don't know how to dance.  Just participate and have fun with it!!  Really, I don't even care if you let your toddler do the art for you.  So long as you have fun doing it, that is all that matters to me.  4) I am going to let my daughter choose her favorite.  So, you'll probably want to butter her up.  Her favorite things are: ladybugs, giraffes, pizza, my little pony, littlest pet shop, princesses, dora and dinosaurs.  You'd probably have a better chance if your art included something with these.  5) If you want to personalize it any further, here is some pictures of her for reference: http://imgur.com/a/i8Tqu#pWnkXFE  6) Please include your redditor name on/in the art somewhere, as well as the date.  Thank you!  7) I will let kiddo choose the winner.  Contest will close tomorrow when I get home from work, in order to give a lot of people the chance to play!  Not sure how many I'll be giving away.  It's kind of a go-with-the-flow type situation.  Might be 1 might be 10.  Who knows.  INSPIRE ME!  Also, include with the submission your e-mail and choice of Big 3.   ****Edit:  You can submit earlier works of art, if you'd like.  I want to see all the creativity you have!  BUT, preference will go to those who make something specifically for this offer, as well as those who include their username/date.  Thanks <3 	1360656652.0

Basically they have started enforcing their previous policy. And the first week it started I was late 3 times due to my alarm not working and me not realizing it. When I got the first verbal counseling today, my manager informed me that I was first in the district to get one. Naturally I said "WOO!" which got a slight chuckle and a not something to be excited about type statement. I don't care, I was still #1.  Now onto the offer part. What is something that you have "won" that you really shouldn't be proud or excited about? Offer open for a day or 2. I'll give whenever I damn well please.  *Edit* Offers are out.

t3_183zwe	1360294761.0	dlcnyc		[OFFER] Need help sending pizzas to Kharkov, Ukraine and Minsk, Belarus	OK, so this is probably a little outside of the normal RAOP realm, but we need some help. If this violates the RAOP rules, let me know and I'll delete...  We have two teams of software developers, in Minsk and Kharkov. We love working with them and want to send our co-workers a pizza as a surprise thank-you for being awesome.  This, however, has proven difficult. Even though one of our team members here in the US is from the Ukraine and has spent quite a while on the phone calling local pizza shops, none of them will accept payment in advance from the USA...they all expect the recipient to pay on delivery (which kind of ruins the surprise).  So, if there are any Redditors in Minsk or Kharkov that can help us out, we'll pay for the pizzas, plus a pizza and some $$$ for the delivery person.  Even if you can't help us directly, any suggestions on how we could make this happen would be greatly appreciated.  	
t3_181r2v	1360213232.0	Schizo123	pizza-gold	[OFFER] Cheer me up (a difficult task) and you get a pizza	U.S. only and your account must be a month old.   SO I've been really pissed off at life all week. I'm usually anxious about everything but this week I've gotten angry. This is very unpleasant and I would like it to stop. All my usual tactics for getting myself in a more mellow mood have failed. Cheer me up and you get a pizza. You can submit anything you like but here are some hints about what might work and what might not:  Things that are NOT likely to work:  1. Pictures of cats (Sorry, I have nothing against cats but pictures of them do not cheer me up).  2. Shallow truisms.   Things that are MORE likely to work:  1.  A picture taken BY YOU of something I haven't seen before, together with a story of how the picture was taken or a story about the subject matter. 2. A philosophical perspective on life that I haven't considered before (doesn't have to be your original thought; it can be something from a book, but I've read a lot of philosophy.) 3. A story about how you personally have overcome adversity. Not "I stubbed my toe" adversity, but bone-crushing or mentally exhausting adversity.   First person to cheer me up gets a pizza. Maybe the second too. WARNING: This won't be easy. I AM PISSED OFF.   EDIT: Forgot to say that this will be a $15 code to Papa John's. Will probably not be able to get it to you before tomorrow night (2/7/13).   EDIT2: Thanks so much everyone. I feel much better. A "winner" has been chosen and PM'ed. 	1360281503.0

My family helped me out to make sure I didn't get kicked out of my house, and my boyfriend kept me fed and watered.

In order to qualify for pizza:  - You have to be an active redditor for at least 1 month  - Not have been pizza'd before  - In the UK  - Down on your luck  Drop a comment here telling me what's up in your life at the moment, who you want the pizza for, and why. It's that simple.   I'll pick one person at around 6.00pm GMT for delivery tonight, February 6th.  It also goes without saying: please don't be an ass and just make something up. There are people out there who could really do with some stranger-cheer in a pizza pie (I know I could have when life kicked me down last year), so listen to your conscience and do something good with it (:  Edit: I have moved the time of choosing to 7pm GMT, to give those getting in from work a chance too.  **Edit 2: juggadan is the lucky pizza winner here, although I really wish I could give pizza to everyone.

t3_17qgeq	1359774126.0	Schizo123	pizza-gold	[Offer] Guess what I am thinking of for up to $30 at Papa Johns. 	U.S. only and your account must be at least a month old.  I made the clues pretty sparse on purpose so that people would have to guess instead of googling for the answer. (Feel free to use google anyway if you want, though). This contest is about luck more than anything. Here are the clues.  1. This is a Russian literary work (could be a novel, short story or play). It is pretty famous but not SUPERfamous, so don't go for the low-hanging fruit like War and Peace.   2. Guess ONE of my two LEAST favorite philosophers. Won't say much about them except that they are both famous and both dead.   If you get one of these right you get $15 at Papa John's. Guess both and you get $30. NOTE: you can take two guesses at either #1 or #2 if you want, but you only get two guesses total.   EDIT: #2 has been guessed as Ayn Rand. (The other one was Heidegger). #1 is still up for grabs.   And #1 has been guessed as well: Notes from the Underground by Dostoyevsky. Thats it. 	1359813469.0
t3_17gsjf	1359422253.0	Schizo123	pizza-gold	[OFFER] I'm thinking of two movies. Guess one and you get 15 Dominos dollars. Guess both and you get 30.	Restrictions: 1. U.S. only (sorry) 2. Must have an account at least a month old.   NOTE: for various reasons I am running this tonight, but if you win you will not get your pizza until WEDNESDAY NIGHT. But you will get it, never fear. If that doesn't sound good to you, don't participate :p.   OK here are the clues - you get exactly two guesses.  1. Both movies have complex, slow-developing plots and (I think) are above-average in length. They aren't terribly obscure either.   2. Movie #1 is based on a piece of classic American literature written between 1875 and 1950.  3. Movie #2 has a religious image/metaphor in its title, although the movie itself does not have a religious theme.    EDIT: This is proving to be tougher than I thought - whoops. I'd rather not add clues now to be fair to the people who have already guessed, but I am going to open it up a bit. Any U.S. redditor with an account over a month old can guess now.   EDIT2 (at 1:30 AM EST): Some very good guesses but nobody has got them. If nobody has guessed the right movies by 11:00 AM today (1/29/13), I will then give a clue that should make them easy to figure out. At that point anyone gets two more guesses even if they have already guessed. So stay tuned!  K Here's two more clues:  4. Both movies came out in 2006  5. Anthony Hopkins played in Movie #1  OK Movie #1 has been guessed: it's All the King's Men.   And Movie #2 is The Good Shepherd. That's it.	1359475856.0

t3_16yh6g	1358727034.0	faceforest	pizza	[Offer] Open to all	Long story short: I was robbed in my home and held at gun point earlier this week by multiple armed robbers and obviously was going through some tough emotion things along with balancing my classes at college. Basically I had a lot of wonderful friends and family who supported my this whole week and while I still am dealing with it all, I would like to pay it forward and help anyone that needs pizza (Other types of food are perfectly acceptable too). Unfortunately my cap on funds is extremely low (for obvious reasons), so I only can pay ~$10. (I'm sorry those with families).   Basically (I know there will be liars as there usually are in these situations) just tell me why you need or would like one. Honestly I would just like to help anyone - whether you just blazed and are starving or like me, just got robbed and lost everything (sorry /r/trees but the latter comes in priority).   I've had support during one of the worst weeks of my life and would like to help support someone else who needs it.   Edit: And not to sound like a dick, but please don't lie, I'm not going to deny you the opportunity if you just say "I'm hungry" I'm just giving precedence to those that have/currently facing hardships.  EDIT: I won't be up/down voting anyone, I'm leaving that to the community to decide-just for the reference of those participating.   **edit:** I'll be ending this in about ~30 minutes and declaring a winner. Stay tuned!  **Congratulations** to obsaxman and HTP5; While I'm low in funding and would love to help you out, I can manage to eat a little less a day to make these two redditers happy. I will PM you will details about how you would like your reward (sorry but still only $10 each)  Honestly, if I could (as I would hope others would), I'd give you all pizzas for the things that have happened to you, I hope you all feel better and things turn out better; I mean hey, I had 2 guns pointed inches from my face upon waking up and 4 days again and I'm getting back to me feet, slowly but surely. It will get better with time. Much love from me to you all!	1358734058.0

I got pizza'd a few weeks ago, and now I want to return the favor to someone that really craves that pie like I do. So, as I've been new at Reddit for the past few months, and I love what I read, I would like to pick someone at RANDOM. But now, I want to make this worth it. My 'WIFE' recently cleaned me out.. bank, property, etc.. I'm left with just my uniforms for work, and I had just happen to find my Truck 30 miles away w/a fee. So the deal is.. Tell me something about your fucked up relationships, past or present. Be Honest. Please... because just for fun, I might buy 2 Pie's. It all depends. I'm fucking broken like everyone else, it would be nice to pay it forward TWICE.  EDIT: Thank you for all the feedback! I picked the winner at random and unfortunately I could only afford 1 Pizza right now (GAS Prices are not good for my truck). I was a little late coming back here and reading through all of your stories. Interesting reads, a few were like HOLY SHIT, WOW.

t3_16igpt	1358114768.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] GAME: Prisoner's Dilemma	***This is one of my more complicated games/contests.  Please skip over this if you are not interested in putting in the effort and just want easy pizza, instead of [complaining](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/13e2fs/offer_lets_play_sentencepicture/c738152).  If you're interested in having some fun with this (and making the mental effort to understand it), please proceed and MAKE SURE TO READ EVERYTHING.***  ---  **OOPS: The deadline for part 1 is Wednesday, the *16th* around 11pm.  (The post initially said Wednesday, the 13th)**  ---  **NEW:** Just to make sure I don't miss anybody... I am sending a PM reply when I note down your entry for Part 1.  If you don't get a reply from me in 24 hours, please resend your message.  (I'll just have to be extra-careful looking through entries near the end, but this is also a good reason to get your entry in early!)  ---  **Important Background Information:**  Ok, so this is one I've been thinking of doing for a while.  This game is basically a version of the [Prisoner's Dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma).  I highly suggest reading the linked Wikipedia page, but here's the most important part (quoted from Wikipedia):  > Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. If he testifies against his partner, he will go free while the partner will get three years in prison on the main charge. Oh, yes, there is a catch ... If both prisoners testify against each other, both will be sentenced to two years in jail.  Also important is this analysis (again from Wikipedia, emphasis mine):  > In this classic version of the game, collaboration is dominated by betrayal; if the other prisoner chooses to stay silent, then betraying them gives a better reward (no sentence instead of one year), and if the other prisoner chooses to betray then betraying them also gives a better reward (two years instead of three). Because betrayal always rewards more than cooperation, all purely rational self-interested prisoners would betray the other, and so the only possible outcome for two purely rational prisoners is for them both to betray each other. **The interesting part of this result is that pursuing individual reward logically leads the prisoners to both betray, but they would get a better reward if they both cooperated. In reality, humans display a systematic bias towards cooperative behavior in this and similar games, much more so than predicted by a theory based only on rational self-interested action.**  I have always been intrigued by the emphasized part of this (well before the [recent game show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_It_All_%28game_show%29)), and figured, let's do a pizza game about it!  ---  **Part 1:**  This part is simple.  To do a game of this sort, I need a fixed number of participants.  I will be using a random number generator to decide.  At the specified time, I am going to use random.org to generate an integer between 1 and 1000.  The 8 people with the closest guesses (over and under both are ok) will get to play the prisoner's dilemma game.  If there is a tie at the far end, it will be broken by generating another random number for that tie.  **IMPORTANT: ENTER BY PM'ING ME YOUR NUMBER.  DO NOT POST ANYTHING HERE.  ANYONE POSTING ANYTHING HERE *WILL* BE DISQUALIFIED.**  If you want to say "good contest" or "you suck" or something you can, but ONLY IF YOU'RE NOT ENTERING THE CONTEST.  This is essential, because a lack of communication between the participants is central to the prisoner's dilemma, so no exceptions will be made.  I will decide the participants around 11pm (this may move around a bit depending on my schedule) on Wednesday, the **16th**.  The participants will be notified via PM.  Note that the participants will not be listed here until after part 2 is over.  ---  **Part 2:**  This is the fun part.  Let's rename "prisoner's dilemma" to "prize-winner's dilemma" and give it this new description in the form of an imaginary letter presented to the 8 people chosen in Part 1:  > Congratulations!  You have been selected by psm321 to receive a $15 pizza prize!  In his great wisdom, he has also randomly paired you up with another Redditor receiving a $15 prize, and decided that you may steal $10 from that Redditor's prize if you wish, making your total prize $25 (and the other Redditor's prize only $5).  He has given the other Redditor this same option.  However, be forewarned... psm321 can be very temperamental.  If both members of the pair decide to steal from each other, psm321 will get mad at how selfish everyone in the world is, and take $5 away from each of your prizes, leaving you each with only $10.  Good luck!  Note that this formulation retains a key aspect of the original prisoner's dilemma.  Each individual is better off by deciding to steal, regardless of what the other person chose.  If your partner doesn't steal, you end up with more if you steal ($25 vs. $15), and if your partner does steal, you end up with more by deciding to steal ($10 vs $5).  However, if each person actually acts on that, both end up worse off than they would have had they both done the right thing and not stolen ($10 each instead of $15 each).  Nobody stealing is better for both than both stealing, but the individual is always better off stealing.  This presents a dilemma in what choice you should make.  Do you trust the other person to do the right thing?  Do they trust you to do the right thing?  Nobody knows...  If you are notified that you are playing, PM me your choice (steal or don't steal) within 12 hours, and your e-mail address (for the gift card).  The sooner people PM me, the sooner I can determine the results and get gift cards out.  If you don't respond within 12 hours, somebody else will take your place.  ---  **Rules:**  * As mentioned above, it is essential to this contest that there be no communication/planning between participants.  This means that if I see any evidence of it, such as a thread here or elsewhere trying to gather participant names, coordinate strategy, or anything like that, I will have to cancel the contest.  Don't ruin it for everyone.  * Prizes will be awarded in the form of US Pizza Hut eGift Cards.  An alternative prize may be considered at my discretion if you can show that you live in the US but have no Pizza Hut near you. Please PM me before players are chosen if you want this consideration.  * Either in an update to this post, or in a new post, I will post the results from the individual pair-ups.  To prevent any fighting, I will present names of participants in one list in randomized order, and then will separately post the results of each of the 4 match-ups without revealing who the players were in each match-up.  * I reserve the right to amend/add any rules as needed to account for situations that I overlooked or forgot about.  * Only one account per person please.  * A thanks thread and/or pictures of the pizza you get are always appreciated (but not required) :)  ---  **Special Note:**  Thanks to a generous Redditor who wishes to remain anonymous for contributing $20 towards the prize pool for this contest!  ---  **Results:**  * The random number was 658 * One person was within the closest 8 but was disqualified for a rule violation, and the next-closest person got to play. * The players were (in order from closest to 658 to farthest): FutureFlyDoc, sambo22, showurnuts, BryosaurusRex, elgreco927, hellow_mellow, DerekSparkles, CrayonManQuestion * The players were randomized into pairs (with a player 1, player 2 ordering because of the recording method I chose). * The results of the pairs were as follows:      **Pair 1**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $5      Player 2 STEALS, gets $25      **Pair 2**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $5      Player 2 STEALS, gets $25      **Pair 3**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $15      Player 2 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $15      **Pair 4**      Player 1 DOESN'T STEAL, gets $5      Player 2 STEALS, gets $25  * Interesting observation: even though the pairs were randomized (before I had responses), 3 of the pairs ended up with the same exact don't steal/steal arrangement (down to the "second" player in my spreadsheet being the one who stole)  * The distribution the random number guesses is also interesting (note the clustering on the low end, another cluster in the middle, and then the really barren upper end):   1-25: ****  26-50:  51-75:   76-100:   101-125: *  126-150:  151-175: *  176-200:   201-225: *  226-250: *  251-275:   276-300:   301-325: *  326-350:  351-375: **  376-400: *  401-425:   426-450: **  451-475: *  476-500: *  501-525: *  526-550:  551-575:   576-600: *  601-625:   626-650: *  651-675:   676-700: *  701-725:   726-750: *  751-775: *  776-800:   801-825:   826-850:  851-875:   876-900:   901-925: *  926-950:  951-975:   976-1000:   * 2 out of the 8 people live out of Pizza Hut range.  Both requested Domino's.  They were 2 out of the 3 people who chose to steal.  My Very Scientific Conclusion: lack of Pizza Hut makes you want Domino's and also makes you mean. :-P  I have an additional interesting observation but I can't post it here because it might reveal who they are.  Thanks to everyone for playing!  Let me know if there are any questions... 	1358484338.0

t3_15re3u	1357017850.0	Thomakaze		[Offer] First person to complete this task earns themselves pizza this Friday. 	Things you will need. A camera, a friend and a youtube account. This is all the information I'm releasing right now just so people have a chance to get ready and it doesn't end up being the first person that reads this. The details will be updated with the task tomorrow morning at 11AM PST  Essentially, you're gonna make a youtube video with instructions I will provide tomorrow. I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys will do for a pizza. The winner will be the first person that links their video here with all the criteria completed.   Happy New Year everyone!  If you have any questions, ask them here.  EDIT: Here is your task!  Perform a cooking video on how to make boxed macaroni and cheese or ramen. (You're making kind of a parody video, so you don't need to cook it how you normally would. Use any ingredients you want, be funny about it, don't worry, you won't have to eat it). Each instruction below will earn you 1 point. The first video posted that earns all points possible wins. If no one gets 100% then the video with the most points by the end of the day wins. Videos are scored out of 10. I'm not going to be "judging" these. Meaning it's only about whether you performed the instruction or not, not how well you did at it.  1. The video most contain a piece of bread stuck to the wall somewhere behind you. Set it up before you start filming. If you touch it or it falls during the video, you do not earn this point.   2. At some point, you must give at least 2 similarities between your mom and a piece of bacon.   3. You must make a pun about birds.   4. Peel an orange and use one slice in your recipe.   5. Attempt to impersonate Steve Brule's voice at least once.Â    6. You must have a moustache (real or drawn on)   7. The last thing you ate last night must be used as part of the recipe.   8. Throw an apple into a trashcan more than 5 feet away   9. Fill your mouth with anything small and roundish (marbles, uncooked beans, uncooked peas, etc) and once full, attempt to say, I'm doing this for a pizza. Then hold up a handwritten sign that says @Thomakaze. Then, empty the contents of your mouth onto the floor.   10. Use a potato peeler as a stirring spoon at least once.     Sounds like a steep order but the first one to do it all in the same cooking video wins a free pizza. I might do a bonus pizza for the video I find the funniest.     Remember, this is a parody cooking instruction video. Be funny, be creative and most importantly, follow all 10 points and the pizzas yours.  Sorry about the god awful formatting. Copy and pasting from the notes app in my phone doesn't look so good.  Good luck everyone!  EDIT: We have a winner! In still leaving this open though as I'd like to see more attempts. Second prize is 10$   I'll start doing these monthly. Next month's will probably be music themed so stay tuned!	1357088940.0

It's like you people don't want pizza or something. As it stands right now, JPree is winning. It could change, though, if more people submit more stories.  EDIT 2: It's now 11pm EST, and still no new stories. JPree is still winning.  EDIT 3: 15 minutes! Final call for stories! It's close between JPree and alexcelest, that's gonna be a tough call.  FINAL EDIT: Time's up! I think it's gotta go to JPree. Burge and alexcelest both had great stories, but I don't think much tops a guy getting his face run over by a car.	1356843800.0

I've been through a lot of shit in my life, and this time of year can be really hard. Last pay-period I worked 120 hours and got over $2,000 deposited into my account tonight. This is pretty exciting for me, coming form a minimum wage job. So I would like to share the wealth this holiday season.   I don't care where your from, where you live, etc, etc. I would like to donate a pizza to someone who is stuck on campus during the holidays and can't make it home to a nice family dinner.   Post some stories, reasoning, etc on why I should pick you! I work from 6pm - 6am, so I will be checking Reddit between those times.   Happy holidays everyone.   - Rinaldi

t3_14l524	1355113773.0	evilrick	FAP	[OFFER] Free Papa John's pizza promo code (valid til 12/16)	Tell me why you want it!  I'm in the mood to laugh, so the funnier the better.  I love original stories, and if they involve something humiliating happening to you/friend/family member, that's even better.  I've embarrassed myself enough times, now it's time to laugh at someone else's misfortune.  It isn't much, but I'd rather give it to someone than see it go to waste, I'm not big on PJ's.  Edit: I'll choose someone tomorrow morning/afternoon, give people time to respond!  Edit2: I decided I'd share my own story, just to be fair.  I was in 9th grade, it was the first half of the school year, so I was still sort of getting used to the whole high school process.  I woke up, telling my parents I wasn't feeling well.  Mom believed me, but dad didn't care and made me go to school anyway.  BIG MISTAKE, DAD  First class of the day, English.  My stomach is churning, my head is pounding, and I can't get the teacher's attention.  The lousy thing is, I'm in the back of the class, as far away from the door as I can be.  My stomach gives one final lurch, and vomit fills my throat.  I can't talk.  I frantically try to get the teacher's attention as the vomit attempts to escape the confines of my body, but he doesn't respond.  I jump up and bolt for the door, holding my hands over my mouth in an attempt to stem the flood.  It doesn't work too well, and a couple of the snottier girls in the class get a little bile on their homework in exchange for their barely stifled snickers.   Bitches.  I make it to the trash can outside the class and a moment later it needs a Hazmat team to clean it.  I bolt to the bathrooms and throw up three more times before I'm able to stumble down to the nurse's office.  Dad had to come pick me up.  My first words as I got in his truck?  Told you I was sick.  I'll announce the winner at ~1-2pm EST, somewhere in there.  Edit: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner!  ohshithax has been chosen!	1355163109.0

I am working on a project and it requires as high of a resolution (I need to see how many pixels everything has) of the 8 world maps (the full world, including that one world that has the little islands you have to boat to) of Super Mario Bros 3, the version from All Stars that has better color than the original. Now I would do it myself but I broke my computer yesterday and am now waiting for parts to be delivered. I had the All Stars game for an emulator and was set to take screenshots when my laptop decided to slip off my lap desk onto the floor and crack the screen.  So, you, if you can get me screenshots of this game's full world maps then I will gift you with a pizza or two. I will also love you forever.  Remember, it is important that it isnt blurry and it is big enough that I can count the pixels.	1354408039.0

t3_13e2fs	1353222627.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] Let's play sentence-picture!	**Please read this *entire* post CAREFULLY before participating (I took the time to write so much for a reason).**  This **requires** all participants to be on the same page to work, so I will ***not*** be able to be tolerant of those not following the rules.  I am doing this after being encouraged [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/12ndkv/meta_complicated_contests/).  Hopefully I will not be disappointed and can do other things of similar (or more) complexity in the future.  ---  **General Information**  So here's my idea: playing sentence-picture (a.k.a. the sentence game a.k.a. telephone pictionary).  The basic idea is that you have a number of players, and alternate between writing a sentence that describes what's going on in the last person's picture, and drawing a picture of the last person's sentence.  It is then amusing to look at the whole chain and how it distorts over iterations.  If that was not clear enough, you can get a basic idea of the game at http://www.thesentencegame.com/rules.php (though not that we will **not** be using that platform, and the rules will **not** be exactly the same, just a general idea).  Read this page anyway, even if you think you already know how the game works.  ---  **Basic structure**  1. We will be playing with 5 people, and 2 alternates. 2. The participants will be selected from the comments (that follow the rules) in this post, using upvotes as a guideline.  The participants will be announced at 4PM EST this evening (Sunday, November 18th). 3. The game will happen at 10pm EST tonight (Sunday, November 18th).  Please make sure you will be available and actively checking Reddit messages at this time if selected as a player or alternate. 4. There will be a second stage in which all five sentence-picture chains will be posted and people will be asked to vote on their favorite contributor amongst the chains.  (This will be done with comments made by me for each username, because it's the best way I can think of, plus free karma!  Mods, please tell me if this breaks some Reddit rule)  ---  **Prizes**  * The 5 main participants will each get a $10 US Pizza Hut eGift Card (assuming they complete the game satisfactorily).  * The 2 alternates will each get a $5 US Pizza Hut eGift Card.  (Bumped up to $10 if they are called on to participate).  * The winning participant from the second stage will get an additional $10 US Pizza Hut eGift Card (or a single $20 card if they had agreed to wait until voting was over to receive the prize).  * An alternative prize may be considered at my discretion if you can show that you live in the US but have no Pizza Hut near you.  Please contact me *before* the contest starts if you want this consideration.  ---  **Game Procedure/Rules**  * Keep everything (sentences and pictures) PG-rated.  Submissions not following this rule will disqualify the submitter.  * Post a comment here with your starting sentence (**and nothing else**).  Everyone should upvote their favorite starting sentences to help me decide who plays.  Only one comment per person.  * If selected, plan to be available from 10PM to 11PM-ish (EST).  This may run a bit longer if I have to bring in alternates.  * At approximately 10PM, I will send everyone a sentence.  Draw a picture of that sentence and send it to me (post on imgur and send me a link) within 15 minutes (make sure that you have the ability to do this, and save time for uploading/messaging).  If I don't get it in time, you are disqualified and I will bring an alternate in.  Pictures may be hand-drawn and photographed, or drawn in a computer program.  Use the "**What are the rules for drawing?**" section on the [thesentencegame](http://www.thesentencegame.com/rules.php) page as approximate guidelines (but keep in mind the PG rule).  * When I have all 5 pictures, I will send them to the next person in the circle.  Write a sentence about what is happening in the picture and send it to me within 5 minutes.  Use the "**What are the rules for sentences?**" section on the [thesentencegame](http://www.thesentencegame.com/rules.php) page as approximate guidelines (but keep in mind the PG rule).  * The above 2 steps will repeat once (so that we end on a sentence, which a complete chain of sentence-picture-sentence-picture-sentence).  * Once the game is complete, alternates who were not called upon to participate will get their prize, and participants will have a choice of receiving their prize or waiting until the second stage is complete.  * At some point (hopefully soon) afterwards, I will post another thread for second stage voting.  ---  **General Rules**  * Please do not use extra accounts to upvote yourself, either in this stage or in the judging stage.  Along the same lines, don't use multiple accounts to put multiple entries in.  * I reserve the right to amend/add any rules as needed to account for situations that I overlooked or forgot about.  * Not a rule per se, but I really appreciate thanks threads, and/or a photo of the pizza!  ---  *Special thanks to [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) (my first time using it) for making composing this post much easier thanks to the Live Preview feature (and to a lesser extent the other editing features).*  ---  **Updates**  1. It looks like we have only 3 participants (Sabromex, AlchemicalMusical, blarglznoflo).  It won't be as fun, but I'm going to try to make this work!  (with some minor changes...)  2. One of the participants had to withdraw unfortunately.  I'm not sure I'll still be able to pull this off.  I'm re-opening this 'till right before we start, so go ahead and post if you're interested.  3. Sorry, not happening (won't work with just 2 people).  Maybe I'll try again later with more notice.  If there are times that work better for people, let me know.  4. Actually, I just thought of a way to do something.  PMs coming soon.  5.

t3_11zp9i	1351054558.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[OFFER] $15 to the big three, but I need your vote (details inside).	This doesn't appear to be outside of the guidelines, but I'll leave it to the moderators if it is.  A friend of mine is in need of a scholarship to go to a conference.  I want her to win it, so I'm going all out for a scholarship.  Here's where you come in: post an imgur picture of you sharing a "please vote" on Facebook (this is super easy, doesn't require an app, and is a ONE TIME ONLY voting thing, for the record) and I'll randomly draw a winner.  PLEASE edit out any and all personal details from your post (I know you kids can use MS Paint).  This is not the time for identity theft or people being meanies, and that can happen if your name is visible.  Details:  If you look at my posting history, you'll see that I'm a generous Redditor. Now, I'd like you to be equally generous to Mel Orpen, a fabulous lady who's trying to be sponsored for a scholarship to a conference by the Victory Institute.  They support up and coming LGBTQ leaders and Mel is an especially worthy candidate and an all around lovely person.  Details here: http://onwardtovictory.victoryinstitute.org/candidate.php?cid=51  You can read her story and (I think) be moved by why she needs to get to this conference and continue being a fabulous ally.  Or, you can just take it from me that she's the most fabulous person the planet.  PM me for details. And, though I know the downvote brigade may be forthcoming, please upvote if you can for visibility. The US can use more allies and Mel is one of them.  (And no, I'm not Mel.)  EDIT:  This will close on Friday.  The more votes the better!  DOUBLE EDIT: Gift card from me awarded to Bryosaurus.  I will let mcredson award his as he sees fit. 	1351266587.0

No Redditors who only post in "gimme" threads asking for assistance without paying it forward.  Must be willing to provide verification if asked and have a valid email address for the e-card.

Papa John's sent me a promo code for their 2 million pizza giveaway, and I want to give it to one of you.  Today, on the second part of my commute to work (I drive to the subway, and it takes me downtown), somehow, I lost my car keys. I still can't figure out how that happened... but it made my morning really shitty (I had to take the subway back to my car, look for my keys, explore the different subway cars; still can't find them, but my aunt is bringing me my spare set when I get out).  So ROAP, answer me this: What's something shitty that happened to you today, that a pizza can fix (or at least can help make you feel better). Examples: Lost my keys, car got a flat tire, motherboard in pc melted, etc; I'm not looking for sob stories, just "Hey, that sucks, but a pizza from a random stranger could make me feel better!"  I'll choose a winner by tomorrow afternoon (Friday), so you can get Papa John's Friday night.  EDIT 1: I'm big on proof, so if something broke and you can take a picture, I can better sympathize.   EDIT 2: The train authority can't find my keys, and since I have a chip in mine (even though it's a 94?!?) a new one will cost $30 to make. That really sucks.  EDIT 3: I ended up choosing two winners, Hbaz09, and jalapeno. I PM'd you, so get back to me.	1350658732.0

How about if I explicitly stated that throwaways are ok and only required the username in the picture and not the person's face?  Would that make it the same as randomly seeing the plate on the road?  --------------  Looking for nerdy license plates.  My particular area of nerdosity is computers, but feel free to explain why the plate is nerdy in whatever field.  Better explained than not, even if you think it's obvious... I can be oblivious sometimes.  Prize: $20 gift card to your choice of Pizza Hut, Domino's, Hungry Howie's (US only)  How to enter:  - Take a close-up picture of your license plate  - Take a picture with you and the car with plate visible/distinguishable, with you holding a sign with your reddit username **and an artistic rendering of your plate.**  - Post both pictures here, preferably with explanation of nerdiness  - Submissions not following the rules will either be ignored or receive a friendly reminder about the rules, depending on my mood.  - After you get your pizza, post a picture of it here (either in this thread or in a thanks thread).  Closes around 9pm EST (may be a little later...) Tuesday 10/15  Also, don't forget to check out this wonderful post by theonefree-man for more free pizza:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/11jhgw/just_so_you_guys_know_hungry_howies_is_giving/  (it's not very visible because it doesn't have a tag, so I just wanted to call more attention to it)	1350436023.0

Show me how you'd look for a first date, or an important job interview, or just because you want to remind people how fucking gorgeous you are.  Just two conditions:  1: Must have a sign anywhere in the pic with the following:  * Your username. * Underneath your username, three circles with an "X" inside each.  2: Must have an account older than 60 days.   Edit: Decided to do one for best-looking guy, and another for best-looking girl. Double the prizes, double the fun!  Edit 2: Keep 'em coming, folks! Lots more guys than gals. Â¡Â¿Donde estan las chicas?! If  at least 13 guys and 13 girls participate, I'll increase it to $20 for each winner.  Edit 3: Going to let this run until 3AM ET; any posts after that won't count! Will decide the winners in the morning around 10AM, and announce who they are here + PM them.   Edit 4: Alright, contest is over. Winner selection will take me a little while, then I'll get in touch. Best of luck, everyone!  **AND THE WINNERS ARE:**  * **32spacemen:** Hand in hair. Great teeth. DAT SMILE!  * **picklespears:** Your one beard pic reminds me of a thinner Andy Hull, and for that you deserve some soul food... Unfortunately, I don't have any. Hopefully a gift card will work!  PMs sent.   Lot of good-looking folks out there and it's a shame I could only choose two, so for everyone I didn't pic (get the pun? man, I'm funny!), I'll probably run another of these over the weekend.

I haven't tried these codes, but I'll do my absolute best to make sure they're honored.  Edit: Thanks for all the good stories.  All pizzas have been allocated.	1350159617.0
t3_11dxym	1350078799.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[OFFER] to the Big 3; US only--for Monday.	It's been awhile, my lovely RAOP-ers!  Unfortunately, purchasing and renovating a house is expensive and time consuming, which is why this offer is going to be living space centered.  I'm going to spend all weekend painting, sanding, unpacking, and generally being miserable.  BOO HISS.  So, I want your best (could be sad, horrifying, funny, whatever) story about where you currently or have in the past lived.  Nightmare roommate?  Reno gone bad?  Find hidden treasure in the crawlspace?  Want to reveal what was REALLY in that safe Oprah apparently paid you for the story of?  Make my Monday a better one and you--yes, YOU!--could win a $15 e-card to the big 3.  As usual:  - No Redditors who only post "want/need/gimme" threads in various assistance forums.  - No Redditors with accounts less than 3 months old.  - No PM-ing me with a sob story begging me for a pizza even though you don't meet the criteria.  - US only  - Must be willing to submit verification code upon request and I will need a valid email address to send the e-card to.  - If you have received multiple pizzas and not paid it forward or contributed something valuable to the threads no pizza for you (at least from me).  Winner will be decided around 12pm Pacific Time on Monday.  EDIT: Winner has been notified!	1350327678.0

t3_1151yh	1349709050.0	psm321	psm321	[Offer] Ann Arbor, MI area	I have a groupon to a pizza place in the area that I can't use the full value of myself.

t3_1130v7	1349608366.0	crashed9	pizza	[Offer] Draw a dinosaur, maybe get a pizza. Contest!	**Got kaeby his/her pizza. :) Enjoy! This was fun, so as soon as I'm able to, I'll do another contest!**  **WINNER: kaeby! Please PM me within an hour so that I can get you your pizza/whatever else! My son had an awesome time looking at all the pictures. I'm pretty certain he liked yours best because it looks just like his favorite dinosaur toy! A close second and third were 4our5quare and blarglznoflo. So if I don't hear from kaeby, I'll just go down to 2nd then 3rd place. :) Thanks so much! I hope I can do this again soon!**  **Closed! Give me ten minutes to get the final decision. :) I'll PM the winner asap!**  My 4 year old is ridiculously obsessed with dinosaurs. To the point where we don't order pepperoni pizza, we order dinosaur meat pizza. He'll be with his dad all day today because I need to study for my big Praxis exam tomorrow (like the bar exam for teachers.. only not so horrendous). I also got two new students to tutor, so I'm finally in a position to do this contest that I've been wanting to do since I first saw RAOP!  So here's the deal. Tonight at 6pm EST, my son will come home. I want to be able to show him a bunch of awesome dinosaur pictures drawn by you guys! I'll let him choose his favorite, and that person will get a pizza!   Rules?:   1. Any picture drawn by you is fine. Doesn't matter if you use Paint or draw something on paper then scan it. As long as it's drawn. 2. Remember: he's 4 years old. I can't tell you what picture he would like better. This isn't really a contest of skill.  3. You can't be a new Redditor. I'll certainly show my kid your picture, but if you've been a member for 0 days, you won't win. Sorry! I think I'll put a one-month-membership requirement.  4. I'm going to use the RAOP email verification thing. 5. $15 to whatever pizza place you want should work. I'll include a $3 tip on top of that. I just need to be able to place an order online!  6. US only. Sorry. :( 7. I would love it if you would post a thank you after you've filled your belly. :) 8. Please sign the picture with your username!  Hints:   1. My son really loves all dinosaurs. T-Rex, triceratops, velociraptor, stegosaurus, diplodocus, pteranodon, etc.  2. A fun scene will probably get his attention more. He likes funny stuff too.  3. He knows that dinosaurs eat other dinosaurs, and that they die in order to be turned into fossils. He thinks it's cool. He loves his dinosaur documentaries!   I'm very excited about this! I hope you guys enjoy the contest as much as we will. :) Also just keep in mind that my son can't read yet, so including sob stories isn't going to get you anywhere. ;)   I'll post the winner after he gets home and chooses. (Around 6pm Eastern!)  **Update: You guys are pretty rad! I love them all. :) He's home now, but he got started finishing a jigsaw puzzle he started this morning (it's a 100 piece panda jigsaw lol) and he doesn't want me bothering him. I'll have him look at all the pictures and make the final decision in a half hour, at 6:30!**	1349653289.0

t3_10vqec	1349281077.0	Vinceidon	pizza-gold	[OFFER]Back Again!	IM BACK! All-American, loving, friend-to-all Sailor! Alright a few weeks ago ill admit i DID get a little carried away with pizza-ing...but THIS time things are different, i promise! Instead of giving away over $500 worth of pizza giftcards, i will be giving away THREE gift cards.  Just not from Dominoes because they hate me apparently. WHO ARE THINKS THEY SHOULD HAVE PIZZA?  Edit: Ouch, why's everybody downvoting each other? Im gonna change up the game a little bit. A test of altruism if you will. Post your blahblah why I want pizza, but here's the catch. Tell me the name of SOMEBODY ELSE who you think should get pizza. If I try to figure out who should get some myself then ill end up spending my entire paycheck on everyone because im an idiot and not drunk (a problem i will fix tomorrow). Recap: VOTE FOR THE PERSON WHO YOU THINK SHOULD GET PIZZA.  END: Alrighty, the AC is making it super cold and im too lazy to put a shirt on so im callin it a night (its 10pm here in Bahrain). Like any good democracy, there's either a 5-way tie or im horrible at counting. Considering im Asian, i dont think it's the counting thing. In the event of a tie, I WILL JUDGE YOU.  1st: wonderland_lily - Good use of Futurama!  2nd: beckermound - Even if you're using multiple accounts, I commend your spirit. YOU WANTED IT THAT HARD.   3rd: Lunar3 - I have a soft spot for moms. I have a mom. She was pregnant a few times I assume. That job sucks. I don't know if i could be a mom. Well i mean, i KNOW i cant because im a dude.  And I lied. I can do that because im an American.   4th place for being the first person to vote: ohitsthatguy86 - Yup, you get one too. BECAUSE I CAN DO THAT  Tune in next pay period for another chance to run in the PIZZA ELECTIONS. Yeah im probably gonna do this a few more times because it's fun. Only stipulation, you can only serve 1 term if you know what i mean. Just to be fair for everyone. AMERICA!	1349291862.0

t3_10ovtk	1348966040.0	JussKiddin	pizza-gold	[Offer] USA Musical Talent Contest! Details inside!	Hello again everyone! It's about that time again where I wish to contribute a gift card for pizza to an individual who aren't afraid to show off their talent! So in this episode, I will be requesting from you a video of you either singing a cover of your favourite(or original) song or playing an instrument to cover a favourite(or original) song. I realize this may take a bit of effort, but would like to see what people can do. Let's put some guide lines down.   1. One entry per person!  2. Please either POST down below or PM me the link to your work. Youtube is preferred. You may put the video under "unlisted" if you are too shy for the public to stumble upon it.  3. Just for the sake of fairness, I would like this video to be brand new! I know some of you may already have prior recordings or videos. Go ahead and have a time stamped card with your Reddit username on it as well.  4. It can be a collaboration with you and your friends, but please keep in mind I only have one gift card to award. Groups will have to share a single prize.  5. THIS IS ONLY FOR FUN! Do not think that you have to have a professionally done video in order to qualify. I only ask that the audio be clear enough for me to enjoy and the time stamped card be clearly visible.  6. This contest goes until Monday October 1st, 9 PM EST. Entries submitted after will not qualify for the contest, although I will still enjoy them even though it's late. Winner will be announced by October 2nd, 9PM EST.  7. Please be from the US. I'm sorry for those outside of the country, but I'm not sure if I am able to send you an e-card. I'd hate it for you to not receive your prize if you win. If you still wish to submit a video just for the sake of it, I will most certainly enjoy it :)  8. Winners will be required to do the usual verification system just because, it appears to be the right thing to do. Standard stuff :P  Good luck and have at it guys! Please let me know if you have any questions! I will add or modify rules as I see fit. Contest might be cancelled if there is a lack of interest in it.    CONTEST IS NOW CLOSED!!! Ok guys thank you very much for participating! The contest is now closed! I will be taking the next 24 hours to enjoy the entries and going through a difficult decision of finding a winner! For everyone else, please enjoy these submissions, as I feel they were all pretty awesome :).   Winner Announcement:  Sorry for the delay everyone! I lost track of time, but my decision is to award Jpree with the pizza! It wasn't easy making a decision, so for those who did not win or were too shy to make a submission, I highly encourage you to try next time around :). Thanks everyone again for participating!

t3_1075ei	1348158171.0	shavill82	pizza	[Offer] CANADA ONLY - Food for your thoughts, must be starving not hungry	OFFER DONE!! I've sent Dauss some funds to pick up some cheap groceries to last a few days longer than a pizza!  Not sure how to flare but sorry I'll keep you posted when I'm able to help again!   Hey everyone!     I've hit hard times in the past couple of months. Even though I'm still stuck in bed from fractured ribs I've had amazing Redditors who helped me out during my times of need.       I'm not a billionaire or a huge money maker. I'm just an average Jane just like most people. I know what it's like to look at your pantry and decide if peanut butter would be good with pasta. Honestly... It's rough.     So to cut to the chase I obviously want to pay it forward today. I'm offering to buy someone dinner. I know this is a pizza thread but I'd rather feed you for a few days rather than a few hours.    And I'm sorry that this offer is only available to Canadians but I don't feel 100% comfortable with over the border assistance.       This offer is for those who honestly have no other source at the moment to get food. I know food banks are probably embarrassing but sometimes people have to qualify for that service. Sorry for the long post but I'm currently on high levels of medication.       So tell me your situation, story, and prove to me that you're really in need. I can only choose one person to help. I wish I could help everyone but just like you my funds are limited.  	1348186145.0

I will work with the funniest entry to get you pizza.  It has to be from a place where I can order online to be delivered to you, so you also have to be willing to share your address.  I reserve the right to exclude entries for whatever reason (mostly to exclude scammers or people who get pizza'd too often, don't feel like spelling out exact criteria).  Closes at 9pm EST.  Edit to add: please be ready to answer PMs interactively at 9pm (EST).  I'm not going to wait too long for responses before I move down the list.  You snooze, you lose!  **WINNERS:** Syvandrius and Italia_still_sucks.  Unfortunately I forgot to specify USA-only, tried to still make it work with Syvandrius in Canada but failed.

t3_zxki9	1347729006.0	shayz	pizza-gold	[Offer][Contest] Kansas City Metro - Papa John's	Being fairly new to Reddit, I just happened to come across the Random Acts of Pizza subreddit and think it's a really neat idea.  I have been pretty fortunate lately, and would like to pay it forward, what better way than with a pizza?   So, in an attempt to get more people involved, here is my first contribution in the form of a small contest. It's pretty simple.   1) Post a photo of you doing something random around Kansas City. It doesn't have to be anything special, but it wouldn't hurt either. If it is not obviously clear that the photo was taken in/around Kansas City, then include the location as well.   2) The photo with the most upvotes at 5PM CST wins a $15 dollar e-gift card to Papa Johns. If by some chance all upvotes are equal, then the first person that posted will win. Simple right?   ** I'm sorry to those of you who are not in Kansas City, but I intend to x-post this to the KC subreddit and it just makes more sense to do it locally first. I will likely do another soon and depending on how this one goes, may change it up a bit.   -------------------------- EDIT Please see my comment posted below for the results, the contest has ended.	1347753152.0

t3_zp626	1347348255.0	psm321	psm321	[OFFER] Let's play a guessing game	**CLOSED**  I'm working on processing the entries...  I'm thinking of a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) **Example of a real number** (since I've been asked and have answered, have to share with everyone): 0.5  PM me your guess and post something (a joke would be nice) here.  (The joke part is optional and not part of the game, would just be nice, but you do have to post something.)  Do *not* post your guess here.  I will pick the closest one that also follows the rules around 9pm EST tonight (Tuesday).  Winner gets $25 gift card to pizza place of their choice (as long as I can buy it online).   **Rules:**  * USA only  * Message your guess to me and post something here.  Do not post your guess here.  * Please only one guess with one account per person (I realize I have no good way to enforce this)  * Must not have gotten pizza'd here in the past 2 weeks (I don't know how to check, please be honest/self-police)  * Must have had Reddit account for at least 6 months  * Must have a reasonable amount of posting history in non-assistance subreddits  * I will need a verification code from the verification system (**only from the winner**)  * Any exact ties (unlikely) will be resolved in favor of the earlier guess  * I reserve the right to exclude anyone for other reasons if something comes up that I didn't think of.  * Optional: it would be nice if you could share a picture of your pizza(s) when you get them.  * Include in your guess message the following phrase: "I read all the rules"  Yes, I realize I don't pass a few of these rules myself. :)  10am edit: add clarification that I only need a verification code from the winner, and add an example of a real number.  Edit2: **Please read the rules!**  I have received way too many submissions that don't follow the rules.  I do intend to stick to the plan of awarding to the closest guess *that follows the rules*, even if it's not the closest guess overall.  Edit3: stats time!  There were 40 total entries/attempted entries.  Of these:  * 1 did not send a message  * 6 did not post here  * 20 did not include some variation of "I read all the rules" in their message.  This number goes up to 25 if I'm strict about the exact phrase.  * 3 have not been members for 6 months  * I deemed the posting history outside assistance subreddits to be insufficient for 4 entries (I was pretty lenient here I think)   Edit4: more stats (I promise, winner(s) coming up soon):  * This leaves 13 entries that follow the rules (9 if I'm strict on the exact "I read all the rules" phrase)  * There were 6 guesses outside the [0, 1] range.  2 of these would have otherwise been valid entries.  Edit5: **The winners!**  * I am awarding this to 2 people.  I had decided to allow slight variations on the "I read all the rules" wording.  The closest otherwise-valid guess came from someone with one of these variations.  I decided that to be fair I also need to award the person who was closest and EXACTLY followed the rules.  * The winners still need to give me their word that they followed rules 3 and 4.  They have been messaged and have 24 hours to claim their prize.  I will post their names and guesses after the prizes are claimed.  If unclaimed after 24 hours (or they fail verification), I will move down the list.  * The secret number was 0.4011844879734216, brought to you by the good folks at random.org  * Oh, and I can't resist one more stat: 4 people guessed some variation of pi (2 guessed actual pi, and 2 pi/10 which actually fits in [0, 1] 	1347415227.0
t3_zoa1h	1347313381.0	RoamingAmber	FAP	[OFFER] Pizza Box Art For Free Pie!	My houseguest and I were craving a pie from our favorite local joint.  Nothing screams "convenience" like online ordering, so we logged onto their website. Joy of joys, these lovely people were so nice as to include a "special requests" field to write in!  Not wanting to let an opportunity to request specialness slide, we typed in "no olives, draw a pony on the box."  We received a call roughly two minutes later from a charming woman who politely informed us we exceeded the text limit so she was not sure what "draw a p" actually meant.  We clarified "pony," she sighed with relief, and we got our tasty, artful pie less than an hour later.  So what will your local pizzeria do for you?  Order a pie over the next week, request something special, and document the results in a photo!  The roomie and I will judge whose pizza place came through for them in the most creative fashion and we'll send you another pie from that over-achieving group of folks!  Contest runs through Sunday, 9/16!

t3_zbuir	1346752319.0	ladyfafa		[Offer][UK] Some voucher codes for takeaway.com (xpost)	Helloooo pizza lovers.  I found 2 codes for an online takeaway site www.takeaway.com and thought I'd share them (seeing as I'm too poor to send anybody pizza myself haha). They don't have coverage throughout the UK by the looks of it (I think they're new? hadn't heard of them until I saw them post something about pizza codes on twitter), but I randomly found a pizza place near my parents' house and we're in the middle of nowhere :D  ---- Code NEWCLIENT gets you Â£6 off any order over Â£10. This apparently only works for your first order with the site.  ---- If you like them on facebook (http://www.facebook.com/takeawaycom.uk) you can use their app to generate a code that gets you Â£5 off any order over Â£6. They also seem to post a fair few deals on FB too... (oh and I had to pay online to make my code work.. it didn't deduct my money when I wanted to pay by cash)  (edit because I suck at formatting)	1346762353.0

Imalaskan88 wins. PM me, dude or lady.  Mama always said you can't get anywhere in life by being lazy. I disagree. I played a facebook game where you click one button, and a virtual ball kicks through a goalpost (hopefully) and you win a gift card to pizza hut. I did exactly that, and now I'd like to give it away.  My contests are always crazy and stupid. Tell me how you're the laziest person out there, and I'll reward you with my gift card that I did next to nothing to earn. Examples are cool, so are pictures. Proof is always a big one for me, but I don't know how you'd show me.  We'll close it up today at 4:15 pm EST. That's when I leave work, and I want that lazy jerk that I pick to have dinner tonight.  Good luck, and keep it lazy!	1346444015.0

I did order a pizza that night but was able to receive the pizza free because of the wrong toppings on my pizza.   I am now giving away the card and will PM the card number and verification code to the post that I choose as the winner. I would like someone to get a pizza this evening so this will only be open for the next hour or so? Post your favorite pizza and the toppings you love and who ever can get the closest to my favorite is the winner. To give a hint I love spicy. If two people post the same topping and I choose those toppings as the winner I will choose based on who posted first. I am going to keep this open to US only just to avoid the card maybe not working for another country.  Edit: thanks for participation. No one picked my number one pizza of pepperoni and green chile or my second favorite of pineapple and jalapeÃ±o but my third which is pepperoni jalapeÃ±o is going to be the winning choice tonight. n0clevername is the winner tonight. 	1346291377.0

Sorry everyone, wish I could help more, but they only sent me one postcard :(  So I was surprised to get some snail mail today from Papa John's. Apparently my "last order did not meet their timely service standards" over a month ago. So they gave me a code for a free Medium Cheese pizza.  I don't really dig cheese pizza and it won't let me add any toppings, so I'm passing it on to one of you, as I am sure someone could use it.  I haven't decided how I'll choose, yet. I'm pretty uninspired and not very creative. Tell me your story, maybe a joke, post a link. Say you want a pizza, I don't know ;) Totally unrelated info but I'm a hardcore gamer. Breaking WoW til mop, been DotA'ing it up lately...  I'll pick someone at around 6pm central.   Sorry, but it does not cover delivery!

t3_yjj28	1345495286.0	AsmaJones	shroom	[Offer] Offer or Trade -- $25 amazon gift card, trade so I can get a pizza for someone?	I have just received two gifts, and would like to pay one of them forward.

Any ideas?  If you want to just take the Amazon card, let me know why you want or need it/what you plan on using it for. I'm not necessarily looking for the saddest story, but I'm not sure what I will go for yet.  **EDIT: I have received quite a few PMs, I'm just going through the last of them and will be giving the gc to someone shortly.

Put it up, leave a link in the comments, and upvote your favorites!  We will start going through the videos around 1800EST, and depending on response, we should have our winners chosen and pizzas sent by 1900EST.  Alas, poor Yorick, thy skull is optional in these bewitched portraits.  Good luck!  **Edit:** Crucial detail! Pizza joint of your choice, folks. We'll be doing it the ["Best Practices"](http://randomactsofpizza.com/info.html#best) way, so check the list of [eGift Card joints](http://randomactsofpizza.com/info.html#cards).

t3_y5zgv	1344893393.0	latenightfapper	pizza	[Offer] Pizza(s) to help me with my job, please!	Hey guys,   It's my first post so I'll try to keep it short and sweet, but this is mainly a test to see if it can lead to bigger charities. I work as a marketing associate for a website called www.Fantapper.com; it's new and we're just starting up so we need some traffic. Anyways, I'd appreciate it if you guys can help me out by going there using the link below  http://taps.la/raop  and create an account (1 minute of your time. it's really that quick). Afterwards, just fan the "Random Acts of Pizza" channel and "tap" (post) a photo (any will do, but I would love to see some of your guys' work since I know there are a lot of struggling artists on here) along with your reddit username so I can contact you for the pizza.  This is coming out of my pocket so I can't donate too many pizzas just yet, but I'd love to get support from my workplace and continue to do this on a regular basis. But more importantly, I'd like to move onto non-profit charities (with the same idea) if this all works out. Thanks!  TL;DR - Go to http://taps.la/raop , create and account, fan the channel, post a picture. Should take about 5 minutes of your time. Will check back in about an hr or so :D  *Edit: wolfamonglilacs got the first pizza. Please continue to sign up with www.Fantapper.com and and post your photo to the "Random Acts of Pizza" channel as I will offer out another pizza sometime this week after my paycheck comes in :D Thanks, guys. 	1344910755.0

I will choose the first to comment!  **EDIT**: I am unsure of how to do online delivery, just comment the phone number or the pizza parlor name in Boxford, I'll direct order it.

t3_xugju	1344376141.0	alexcelest	FAP	[Offer] - Reposting since I have only 1 person so far coming for pizza. Homemade pizza, if you come to Bothell P&R WA	So far 1 person has asked for a pizza on Friday. I am still offering 3 more. I'm reposting this because there seems to be a lot of requests today. OP below.  ----  I am unable to offer any pizza from a company because I have no credit card and can't drive to one. I do on the other hand have an oven.  I am offering up to 4 people a homemade pizza of either cheese or pepperoni. You can either ask for it baked in my oven or for it to be kinda like papa murphies where I put it together and you take it home to cook.  The biggest catch is that since I can't drive you'd have to come to me. The easiest place would be the Bothell park & ride since its a public place and anyone who needs to can take the bus there.  I'm posting this a few days early so I can hopefully get responses. If there's more than 4 people I guess I'll have to pull names out of a hat and the drawing would be on the 9th around 7pm PST.

For now, I am going to go with the birthday boy's Justin Bieber experience.  What a mortifying first day of school, and it seems, today is his birthday, so CONGRATS Ilivelaughlovetoday. ******   First go at this, but after reading through a few pages, I think I know how it goes.  Up for grabs is a single $50 pizza party.  Rules:    You have to agree to spend the entire $50 in one order.  Invite some friends or family over, really ENJOY it.  I want someone who will agree to post several pics of this pizza party.  I'm having a pretty quiet couple of weeks, let me live vicariously through you and make me laugh.  Now, for the real fun part.  I want stories of your most embarrassing moments.  The person who makes me cringe in sympathy will get this pizza party.    I realize it's a Tuesday afternoon and kind of dead, but let's see what we can come up with.  I have to leave at 5pm Central time, so you have 4 1/2 hours.  TL;DR:  Read it :)  EDIT:  AFTER READING A FEW POSTS DOWN, IT APPEARS BOTH DOMINOS AND PAPA JOHNS HAVE 50% OFF DEALS GOING, SO THIS COULD BE $100 IF ORDERING FROM THESE PLACES!	1344372039.0

Comment, too, if you don't mind, just because that also shows you're in it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/xb7yb/please_help_my_friend_with_lung_cancer_try_and/  Second step: Use any avenue you have -- twitter, facebook, subreddits, irc, ICQ, smoke signals, whatever you have at your disposal to try and get the word out there.

t3_x2gdq	1343128532.0	threedice	threedice	[offer] $15 Little Caesars card - the "Stupidest Pop Song" challenge!	Okay, as promised, I've got a chance for you to win a $15 "Little Caesars" gift card.  And I want you to have some fun with this.  To win this card, post a video of yourself singing what you think is the stupidest pop song ever, and link that video to RAoP.  Make fun of that song.  Goof on it.  Make funny faces if you want.  Get your friends to sing backup.  Use puppets.  Do it a cappella, or get a whole band together.  Sing it with a karaoke machine or sing along with the real track.   You need to sing the song for at least 60 seconds.  And at the end of your performance, I need to hear you shout, in your best concert encore voice, "Thank you Threedice!"  Then post your video, or at least a link to it, in this thread.  Let's all have fun with this.  You want to goof on Carly Ray Jepsen?  Go ahead.  You still wanna challenge your inner Rebecca Black?  Let's hear it.  You think you can make me laugh with Nickelback?  I'm waiting.  Impress me.  The video that makes me laugh the most, the one that makes me want to re-wind it over and over again and laugh so hard, wins the Little Caesars card.  And depending on how many funny entries I receive, I might hand out more than one card.  I've done it before.  Give me a reason to do it again.  This is only open to United States RAOP members who have a Little Caesars in their area.  Contest runs until Friday, July 27 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern, at which time I'll PM the winner (or winners) and give them the gift card code.  Let the singing begin!!  CONTEST IS CLOSED - Nobody entered their video.  Sadness.	1343422863.0

If you're like I used to be and won't ever leave your dang room, I feel like giving you pizza just because.

Make it interesting! * Fort Campbell gets a couple extra cool points! But pizza is universal, so I encourage you other branches to submit too!  Stay cool!  Edit* I've decide to extend this thing until Friday night because I guess no one in RAOP lives in barracks... there has to be at least a few...right?   BUT ALSO:: [mitch3910](http://www.reddit.com/user/mitch3910) who's downrange right now in Afghanistan has decided TWO people need pizza instead of one!

t3_x157m	1343072183.0	whyamithehump	pizza	[Offer] Scavenger hunt! US Only	Let's try something different. I'm going to post a list of items or locations or people. The first person to post an imgur album of as many of them as possible will get pizza from one of the big 3. You must verify they are original pictures by including your username somewhere in the post (yourself holding a piece of paper, etc). You can get creative, ultimately I will have final say about what qualifies and what doesn't. You do not have to complete the list, as that will probably be impossible. Let's see how you do. Given the time consuming nature of this contest, this will end THURSDAY giving you 3 days to complete as many as possible.   Here we go:  * A mandolin * A home depot hot dog stand * A coin from 1978 * A newspaper ad for a lingerie store * A handwritten family recipe for apple pie * A hairless (living) animal * A statue or sculpture related to space travel in a public place * A machete * A nintendo console predating the N64 * Twins or triplets * An animal not native to the US * A Sam's Club/Costco employee handing out samples * A bottle of leave-in conditioner * A man dressed in drag * A cucumber * A ball of twine * An empty aquarium * A group of 3 or more pugs * A meeting of the Red Hat Ladies * A venture scout * A copy of the Sega Dreamcast game D2 * A travel insurance form * A bloody mary * A fixed gear bike * An origami crane * A guestbook of a local attraction * A Justin Bieber trading card * Hershey's Kisses * A receipt for something under $1.00 * A receipt for a purchase exactly at noon * An Ikea * A windows phone * A bible with birth and death records for at least 3 generations * A completed jigsaw puzzle * A nook simple touch * An AOL free internet CD * An ice luge * A bottled of cupcake flavored vodka * Pogs. * An oversized version of a typical candy * Easy mac * A HAM radio * A TI-89 Calculator  GOOD LUCK!  EDIT: Seems to be a little confusion, you do NOT have to complete the list, just whatever you can and the person with the most wins. It's a fun, silly contest and many of them items are meant to be humorous, don't be Debby Downers over free pizza.	1343085388.0

t3_wneo8	1342456386.0	threedice	threedice	[OFFER] $20 Domino's GC to celebrate the big payoff!	So here's what happened.  Five years ago, I took out a loan to pay some major car repairs.  It took a lot of saving and scrimping and going without - the loan actually lasted longer than the car - but last Friday I not only paid off the loan, but paid it off FIVE MONTHS EARLY.  So to celebrate, I'm going to offer a $20 Domino's GC to one lucky RAOP resident.  Here's what I want you to do.  In this post thread, tell me the one debt owed by you - financial, emotional, personal or otherwise - that you have successfully paid off.  Was it a college loan?  Was it money your parents or a friend lent you?  Did someone help you out in a time of need and you found a way to return the kindness?  At 5pm (Eastern) Tuesday July 17, I'll look over the entries and select the one that really impresses me or catches my attention.  At that point, I'll contact the person and send them the codes for the gift card through DM.  United States residents only, and you gotta be near a Domino's that can deliver to you.  **UPDATE** Thanks for all the uplifting stories of the debts all of you have paid.  I only wish I had more cards to give out.  The winner of the $20 Domino's gift card is **Dapner**.  Enjoy the pizza!	1342558053.0

I can rundown almost every piece of hardware in every computer, but software and coding turns me into a drooling dope.

t3_wmajs	1342401025.0	vokebot	pizza	[Offer] TOMORROW 7/16/12, I would like to send 3 Dominos large 3-topping pizzas to three people in need. Carryout only so that I can provide for more people please.	This has been the worst week of my life but I realized I am blessed to be able to put food on my table until payday and I would like to pay it forward. Please post your desired location and desired time for your order to be complete. I am offering this for tomorrow because I know it is late in the day. I will notify the three people (to be selected at random by the responses... I am truly sorry but I am not sure of any other fair way to do this) tomorrow morning. All I need is a pick up time at a specific location, your name, and the options of your choosing (crust, sauce, etc) with the three toppings you would like. I hope there is no issue through the Domino's website to complicate buying three different pizzas and three different locations in the same day.   Should you encounter any problem and if I see that I haven't been charged, I will gladly reschedule your pizza and call them to sort out any issues.  **REQUIRED INFO**  1. Nearest Domino's location.  1. The time you would like to pick up your pizza.  1. Your name (send via PM, post the other three requirements here please)  1. Crust and sauce options with 3 toppings.  Hopefully I did this correctly. And again, this is for ***TOMORROW, Monday July 16.***    **EDIT 7/16, 10:10AM pacific**  I have chosen 3 people at random that I'm going to attempt to send pizza to today! In an effort to make things more convenient, I would like to send each of you an e-giftcard for $10. I know I asked for toppings and times, but I also know that sometimes plans change so I rather you have options. The $10 will easily cover the $7.99 large three topping carry out special that I was offering to begin with. Sorry for this being kinda sloppy, it's my first time doing this and I clearly didn't think it far enough through. At any rate, the three people receiving gift cards will be: sammynicxo, indianagirljw, and Call_of_the_Void. I'm going to PM all of you now so that I can get your email addresses! Have a great day everyone, be good to each other.	1342459191.0

t3_w5orv	1341623156.0	Truce_Giantmidget	PIF	[Offer] I've been pizza'd twice so far  heres one I can pay foward.	One of mine was from sob story the other was because I was taking my little sisters swimming. Somebody let me order pizza for them, and that put me over my points for papajohns. So I'm using them to pay a pizza forward. I'm the oldest out of 7 children between my mother and father. I'm 24 and the youngest is 7, and I love them very much especially doing things with them. For Independence Day I cooked tamales and the youngest wanted to help so I let her mix the dough. Then when it came time to assemble them I set her up a station next to me on the table, and taught her how to roll them up. The whole day after that she went around to everybody saying she got to make tamales with her favourite big brother. That is just one of the latest stories. Last halloween I made a Princess Mononoke costume that looked like San for another one of my little sisters. It was made with her red mask, white fur, and spear. I used a white ghost mask painted red and brown then attached it to a fake fur bathroom mat that you can find at walmart. For the spear I shaped the blade from foam, and wraped quater inch dowels with black ribbon. I could go on but that will take forever.    What you have to do for the pizza is tell your favourite story about what you have done for a sibling, cousin, or good friend that you think of as a sibling. Pictures would help but are not required. Tomorrow I'll choose somebody about 6pm est.  **UPDATE:** Gave the pizza to **Aesirr** because his story had 2 things i love Surprising sisters, and metal. He will be getting it at the store around 8pm. I couldn't afford delivery.  I wish i could give more but i'm unemployed so i cant afford it. Remember to love family and teach the younger generations to not cross family. I think of the crap my parents generation put themselves and us kids through and it sickens me. I would hate myself if i treated my sisters and brothers they way they did.	1341699111.0

t3_vxlnv	1341250977.0	nuviiwillow	PIF	[Offer]  write me a note to hang on my door and you will get a gift card to Dominos!	I have the unfortunate circumstance of having my garage open onto a street that I don't actually live on... Imagine that I live on The corner of Apple ST and Banana ST my address is on 123 Apple ST but my garage is on Banana ST. As such I am constantly getting a flow of people coming to my house looking for 123 Banana ST (including pizza delivery and ups deliveries). Normally I just tell them where they went wrong and point them in the right direction... (explain that this is actually 123 apple and they want 123 banana her house is on that road about 10 houses down)  but recently I started babysitting a little 6 week old boy who is a very light sleeper. Anytime the door bell buzzes  or someone knocks he wakes up squalling. I am at my wits end.   What you have to do is write (type) me a note that I can post on my door. Explain what they did wrong. And how to fix it. It would be helpful if it said something about this not being Amanda's house that this is Nuviiwillow's house.   Something Liam Neesonesque a la Taken would be good too. And I am not above threatening to break fingers or arms as punishment for waking the baby.   Accounts submitting must be at least 6 months old.   Absolutely no sob stories. But stories of commiseration are welcome.  Sorry folks US only.   Must promise to post pics of pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If I can't make up my mind I will do runners up cards too.

t3_vnz6l	1340765974.0	elgreco927	dragon	[Offer] Do you work overnights?  I'd like to buy you a pizza. (U.S. only)	**CLOSED**  Thank you for all your posts, I enjoyed reading through them.  I have chosen to give the gift card to **isothien** for regaling us with colorful tales of midnight McDonald's shenanigans.    And a **big thank you** to all the unsung heroes working the midnight shift!   ---------   Last Saturday night, I had a pretty shitty night.  I won't go into details, but at about 5am after a long night and long drive home, I decided to stop at IHOP and drown my sorrows in pancakes and maple syrup.   The lone waitress there was visibly stressed, and looked like she had a hell of a night herself.  I found out later that a table had just dined and ditched on her.    Despite her bad luck, she was very pleasant when talking to me and was really hustling to clear tables and serve her customers.  I've worked at a restaurant before, and could appreciate how tough a job it can be, even without asshole customers.  Anyways, when I left, I walked up to the cash register where she was to pay my bill.  I asked her if she always worked overnights, and she nodded yes.  My bill was only $10.  I pulled out my wallet, and handed her my last $40, and told her to keep the change.  She paused for a few seconds with a look of incredulity, started to tear up a little bit, and then thanked me.  I wanted to brighten her night up a bit, and being able to help someone else improved my mood as well.    I'm not trying to toot my own horn.  I just wanted to tell this story, and in honor of all hard-working 3rd shifters out there, give away a pizza.    So if you work overnights, tell me about it.  What do you do, how did you get the job, do you like working nights, post some pics, etc.  I'll pick someone in the next day or 2 and send a $15 gift card to one of the big 3 chains.    Oh, and if you've ever dined and ditched, go fuck yourself.	1340856526.0

I will PM you and since it's so late, we can get you a pizza tomorrow or whenever convenient for you.**  It's simple, I want you to tell me the lyrics that stood out to you most in your life.

t3_vk8h4	1340607236.0	seanpadraic	PIF	[Offer] Got pizza'd a long time ago and said I would pay it forward when I was better off. The time has come! 	UPDATE: The pizza goes to lilMrsSunshine! She emailed me proof of her situation and I have sent her a $20 giftcard to papajohns. I hope you and your children enjoy it! Sorry, to everyone else who posted and didn't get pizza. I really wish I could give more! Maybe someday soon, I will give again! Good luck to you all!    The time difference might make this a little tricky if you live in the U.S. because I am in South Korea.  I will give a $20 e-giftcard to someone in the next 24 hours. Just tell me why I should give it to you and I will give it to the person I think most deserves.   EDIT: Is it rude/tactless to ask whomever I choose for proof that they aren't lying about their situation?	1340677093.0
t3_vj4dr	1340559355.0	Fuzzywumpkis	PIF	[Offer] Feeling really down. If you could share some of your joyful, bubbly, and up-beat attitude, I gladly sponsor today's dinner!	UPDATE: The following people have been gifted with e-cards: murphy1210, girlinacoma, and sunnyinphilly69. Thanks to everybody who was kind enough to make a difference in my day. I am very grateful for all the love and kindness which was directed towards me. Oh, and yes, I do feel better. :)  Yup, like the title states: I am feeling down. Totally blasÃ©. Cried literally over spilled milk (well... It was Gatorade) this morning, and now have been sitting for a couple hours in my room staring at my laundry (which wants to get folded, I suppose). I have to go to work in 1 1/2 hours; not much fun either. Being unhappy about my love-life (non-existent), my figure (slightly too squishy), and other trivial shit. I need desperately to get out of this funk!!! So not healthy!!! Now, how you help me is up to you, but be creative? I am up to try anything. Whatever it takes to stop feeling so "blah"... Any ideas? The most effective will get rewarded, maybe the second best, too. :  EDIT: You guys made me already feel better. Still a little bit pouty and such, but at least I don't feel like I am invisible and wasting someone's air for selfish reasons. I liked your ideas very much, and I will try some of them. I promised already 2 pizzas, but eh... whatever... if you keep it coming I am sure I can squeeze 1 or 2 more pies out of my budget. Money doesn't make you happy... Pizza does. :D	1340585710.0

t3_veis0	1340315037.0	2phresh	pizza	[OFFER] Idk, I'm bored. Who needs some pizza?	Keyword: needs. I'd like to fatten up someone who is actually down, not just having a pizza craving.

t3_vdfb1	1340264064.0	geyserguy92	PIF	[Offer] It's bigger on the inside! 	Hey folks, I've been pizza'd once before and held a contest to give away my free Artisan pizza a couple months ago and thought I'd do another little contest for you.  So I recently watched the entire new series of Doctor Who and have fallen in love.  With the show and Karen Gillan.  Tell me what exactly it is that you love about Doctor Who.  What makes you a Whovian?    I can't pinpoint a reason myself.  I just love the show.  I love the Doctor's constant amazement with everything.  He's seen so much and the tiniest speck of life amazes him.  I love his companions.  From Rose all the way to Amy (Amelia).  I love the story, and the way it all falls together.  I love every actor's ability to embody the spirit of the doctor.  I just love it.  Also, my dream is to be the 12th or 13th doctor.  This dream is made infinitely harder by the fact that I'm American and can only do a decent british accent.  [I really think I have the hair for the job, though](http://imgur.com/a/VdS27)  Alternatively!  If you don't watch Doctor Who, you can tell me about a time where things got a little Wibbly-Wobbly Timey-Wimey for you.  Woke up and had no idea what day or year it was?  Lost track of how long you'd been doing something?  If you think it fits the idea of Wibbly-Wobbly Timey-Wimey give it a crack.  Worse that happens is I laugh at you mercilessly from the safety of being behind a computer screen and not in your presence.    One last thing, I don't know exactly how to do this for my oversea's pizza lovers, but if there is a way I will find it.  I am sure if anybody knows JetBoyTerp does and they can help me.  Good luck all.  Anyway, offer is for a $10 gift card!  Have at it Ladies and Gents.  I'll pick the best at 6PM Central Standard time tomorrow!  Edit: Words, man.  Edit 2:  To make it clear, by tomorrow I meant the 22nd of June 2012.  Final Edit:  Forgot to pick one at 6, back to pick one now.  I have chosen Rose_Tyler_Fan as the winner.  Really thank you to everyone who told their stories.  It's been great. 	1340417725.0
t3_vd1er	1340245946.0	oscillatorsss	PIF	[Offer] Returning the favor/in honor of a great ASVAB score.	My very first reddit post was one here a few weeks ago asking for some pizza help. Well, not one but two redditors answered the call - paulinator and PerfectlyFrank27.   So, I'd like to return the favor. Money's not so bad right now. I can only do one tonight, but will do another ASAP. I'm also celebrating the fact that I dominated my ASVAB today making me eligible for basically whatever job I want in the Army National Guard (I know the ASVAB isn't exactly a MENSA induction, but this was a huge goal of mine).  So, let me hear it! Tell me why you need a pizza and I will set you up.  EDIT: I have given the pizza to OpinionatedSouthern. Honestly, I wish I could hook everyone in this thread up. If I had the money, I absolutely would. I will however be doing this again within the next couple weeks, so keep looking out.   Thank you all so much for your well wishes and support. I honestly can't begin to tell how much it means to me. I love this place.	1340250274.0

t3_vaelg	1340132773.0	maxkitten		[offer] 10 free pizzas here - 1 / week for 10 weeks! :)	Hey guys, I'm having a pretty good day so I wanted to do something nice to brighten up someone else's day too. :) I remember the days when I myself only had 5 bucks to fill up the car with gas, so now that I can afford to help others, I definitely wanna take that chance. I came across this subreddit last month and thought it was the coolest thing ever, so here's what I came up with: I'm gonna give away a free pizza every week for 10 weeks, and YOU GUYS decide who it goes to! So post your story here if you think it should go to you, and every week the most upvoted post will get the free pizza (excluding previous winners, jokes or unrelated posts). If this works out well, I might make this a permanent thing - we'll see. :) The first pizza goes out in a week, so post away guys! And have fun: if you don't win one week, you might win another week or another offer. Remember, whenever life gets you down, just think of Og Mandino's words:  **"...I will chuckle and my burdens will be lightened; I will laugh and my life will be lengthened for this is the great secret of long life and now it is mine. I will laugh at the world. And most of all, I will laugh at myself for man is most comical when he takes himself too seriously. Never will I fall into this trap of the mind. For though I be natureâs greatest miracle, am I not still a mere grain tossed about by the winds of time? Do I truly know whence I came or whither I am bound? Will my concern for this day not seem foolish ten years hence? Why should I permit the petty happenings of today to disturb me? What can take place before this sun sets which will not seem insignificant in the river of centuries?..."**  **[Read the whole thing here for free](http://kathypilcher.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/og-mandino-scrolls.pdf) - guaranteed better than any pizza you've ever had! :)** It was written by a homeless man who went on to sell over 50,000,000 books (not a typo).  P.S. Winners, please verify email / ip with [randomactsofpizza.com](http://rikbrown.co.uk/rop/). Also, to those looking to game the system, I just wanna say: somewhere out there there are hungry families, hungry kids... Do you seriously want food that you took away from them? Think about that. Not only are you screwing over some hungry kid, but you're also discouraging people from helping others in the future. Is a bit of free food that'll be gone in 30 minutes really worth that much to you? What would you say to someone you saw doing that? What would your parents or friends say?	1340140644.0

t3_v8xfo	1340060428.0	inflexiblemadness	PIF	[Offer] I was graciously pizza'd by an amazing redditor, and I want to pay it forward as well as provide an update on my situation for those interested.	If anyone remembers me, I am [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/u9426/request_wife_and_i_just_got_back_from_an_awesome/) guy. Basically my wife and I went on an awesome vacation and spent a week in Texas visiting some family and having a great time, feeling recharged and ready to go back to work, only to come home and find out we have both been laid off on the same day. awana56 was kind enough to cheer us up with a pizza as we were both in a foul mood that day.  I was also touched by how many people gave me words of encouragement, telling me to not lose faith and to get out there and kick the job market's ass. So I did just that.  I found a job that is full time and even pays a couple bucks better. It has WAY better benefits - PTO, sick days, a matching 401(k), and so on. This is a great job for me while I plod my way through the mind-numbing, debt-laden clusterfuck that is college. My wife is still looking but she has already had a couple interviews and we are feeling good about the leads she has and our finances are already getting back in order.  I offered to buy awana56 a pizza of his own, but he refused, insisting that I pizza forward. I got my first paycheck and while I can't spend too much on you ($15-$20), I want to give a pizza to someone who is down on their luck right now.   This community moved me with its overwhelming kindness (and tasty pizza). I want to pay it forward and continue to be a part of the awesome RAOP tradition.

I'm broke now, but I have enough gas and food to last until payday and my brother-in-law is paying me $200 on Friday too! Life is good over here, and I'm going to give someone a Papa John's pizza. I have enough points for 1 pie so I'll order one for you to pickup. First person to post a verified picture of themselves holding a cat gets the pizza. Or if you have a sob story that really hits home. I just want to give a pie.  Edit: We have a winner.	1339685542.0
t3_uyy2l	1339548454.0	OpinionatedSouthern	pizza-gold	[Offer] 2 new P'Zolos at Pizza Hut for 2 different people - Pick Up Only	Edit: Just checked the balance on my gift card, and both orders were picked up successfully. Thanks, pizza lovers. :) That was a great first pizza giving experience! ---  Pizza Hut's new P'Zolos are 2 for 5.00 right now. Buffalo Chicken, Meat Trio, or Italian Steak. In order to stretch my giving, I'd like to offer 2 P'Zolos to 2 different people. You WILL have to pick them up (again, this stretches my gift card by not having to have a minimum order amount and shipping charges or tip). So, if you live close to a Pizza Hut, leave a comment and let me know. First 2 people to post that they could use a couple of P'Zolos get them! 	1339552378.0
t3_uy6xa	1339520498.0	ShutUpBaby_IKnowIt	pizza-gold	[offer] Are your kids as excited as "my" kids?	So I'm a nanny and school is almost out!  My boys are going crazy with excitement!  In order to be eligible to win a $20 gc, you must either have children/work with them (and be willing to pm me proof) and tell me your best "I'm too excited to function" story.  The story doesn't have to be about school ending or about children, I just want to hear about the time you were pee-your-pants excited.  I'll share one of mine as an example, which subsequently has to do with school ending.  In third grade, we were cleaning out our desks on the last day of school and I was making spastic dancing movements.  When the final bell rung, I somehow slammed my face into my desk in one epic dance spasm and chipped both my front teeth.  I ended up spending the first day of summer in a dentist chair.  Anyways, the offer will end tomorrow morning when one person will be chose at random.  Please be from the US if you want the gift card, but feel free to share your story regardless of your location!  Thanks for reading!

She's all lovely, as is her lil' one.  The only problem is...I'm in the US.  I've tried justeat with no success.  They're really hoping for something a bit more healthful than Domino's or the like and I'm not sure where else to turn, as it appears most vendors require a UK billing address.  Can someone, ANYONE, in the UK help her out?  The original offer was $20, which is around 13 English pounds, but whatever.    I WILL REIMBURSE YOU SOMEHOW, SOME WAY.  I will send you an Amazon card if I can, iTunes, etc.  I just refuse to use Paypal.  They're evil.  Or, if you'd prefer, you can just get unlimited karma.  That's right, I will personally upvote every single thing you post every time.  Or whatever we can work out.  PLEASE HELP ME!	
t3_unky5	1338964827.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[OFFER] If you're in a new spot...$20 to the big 3!	So, we recently signed the papers for our new house (hence my lack of offers--down payments, inspections, etc. are expensive!).  But, I'm willing to pay it forward with $20 toward the big 3 via e-card IF...  1. You can prove you've recently moved to a new dorm (it is the summer semester), apartment, house, etc.  PLEASE block out all personal info BUT include your Reddit name via an imgur, etc. link.  2. You've been a Redditor for 3+ months in good standing (e.g., no unpaid loans on r/assistance, etc.)  3. You haven't received more than 2 offers without paying it forward.  4. You are willing, if asked, to do the whole verification thingie.  This is a late night offer, so it will expire at 3pm EST on Weds, June 6.  IF no one can meet these requirements at the required time, I will pick a random respondent to receive the e-card.  EDIT: Closing this one out a few minutes early because my pup is sick...this also means that our winner may need to be patient while I get the e-card delivered.  However, drumroll please, our randomly chosen winner is: medusa010!  Thanks to all who participated.  medusa010, I will PM you and ask for your preference and get you the e-card in the mail ASAP.    DOUBLE EDIT: It appears our winner is UK.  I've never done a non-US transaction and, after reading the international ordering field guide, am terrified.  HELP ME!!!!  TRIPLE EDIT:  Alright, I'm striking out at this international ordering thing.  So, I've posted for help here: http://redd.it/uog48  If no one can help me out, I'll figure something out.  Tomorrow, I will pick a US resident for a $20 gift card so I'll open this back up for entries until tomorrow afternoon.  3pm EST; 12pm Pacific.  ALRIGHT!

EDIT: Replied to the first round of comments solely on this post, there are a few that I'd like more verification from before I proceed. Also, keep the comments coming. As crazy as some of the accident and medical issue comments are I don't feel exactly impressed by how badly you or a loved one was injured, but do appreciate the stories!	1338448194.0

t3_u32en	1337881555.0	ShutUpBaby_IKnowIt	pizza-gold	[offer] help me choose a charity, get a $15 gc	Hey Raop'ers,   So today is my birthday, and every year since I've been an "adult," I've taken the amount of "Happy Birthdays" I recieve via Facebook, text message, phone calls, and emails and made them each worth $1.  I then donate that amount (typically around $100) to a cause.  Last year it was "It gets better", the year before-the ASPCA, etc.  Anyways, this year I'm making two donations: one to NAMI, a cause near and dear to my heart, and the other to be chosen by you.    The way you can win this gift card is by providing me a web page link to the charity, upon which I will do my research.  I'm sure there will be a lot of great causes, so please don't think I am disregarding you if you aren't chosen.  I will choose by tomorrow midday.  Thank you!   **Congrats to jenncantdance for suggesting save a life (a organization focused on no-kill shelters).  They have won the gc and the org will be getting $126 in the name of RAOP.  However, I want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for suggesting such great charities and for wishing me a happy birthday.  I hope everyone has an awesome day!**	1337959775.0

t3_shbac	1334808681.0	czhunc	pizza-gold	[Offer][Contest] Three $15 Gift Cards. Details Inside. 	I've been a part of the RAOP community for a while now, and it's honestly one of the things I look forward to most during my day. I love reading the posts on here, I really enjoy the people here, and of course I love seeing people enjoy their pizza!   Anyways, my new rule is that if I have pizza, someone else will also have pizza. I won't tell you how many times I've had pizza since I made this rule, but you can probably hazard a guess.   I can't think of anything special to hold a contest about right now, so I've decided to let RAOP decide.   1. Contest ends 9PM EST today (4/19)... so in ~~9 hours~~ 18 hours. (Thanks to lilowlpal for noticing the error)  2. Tell RAOP why you want or need pizza. Or tell a joke. Or take a picture of your pet. Whatever you feel like. Brighten somebody's day.   3. I will send the gift cards to the top three most upvoted comments. **Downvotes will not be counted.**  4. Please vote up any and all comments that you enjoyed.   5. One top-level comment per person please.   6. I reserve the right to make the final call.   I think that's it. Be nice, and may the odds always be in your favor!  *Edit 1: Thanks to everyone who commented and voted! Congratulations to Chaeleigh, ballsdeep_in_lame and jiggster318. I'll be sending you PM's shortly.*	True

I also would love a thank you post whenever you get around to eating the pizza.  Now as for the contest... My favorite contests are the drawing ones, so draw a picture of my dog (pictures below) doing something awesome! Be creative! Winner will be decided based on combo of upvotes (downvoting won't help your cause) and whatever cheers me up the most :D  http://imgur.com/a/AeRLK  **Edit**: You can also draw a corgi instead of my dog, as they are the only type of dog that makes me melt instantly, other than my own  **Edit2:** Thank you so much everyone who commented! It really made a long night bearable! cowzgoezmoo and h3avycoat are both getting cards because I can't decide... I wish I oculd give you all cards! Thanks again!	True

t3_sgipo	1334778187.0	ReverendDS	pizza	[Offer] Some weird rules, see inside.	I've never done an offer thread before (at least not that I remember), I usually just respond to other's requests.  So, here goes...  Rule 1. You must be a redditor for at least six months.  Rule 2. You must be a *contributing* member of reddit (eg: you have posts in other sub-reddits).  Rule 3. You must submit, in this thread, a drawing of a falcon carrying a sword... done with your non-dominant hand.  I have a short attention span, so I'll pick someone within the next hour or two.  Also, as much as I would love to be able to make some family's day, I'm on a fairly limited budget myself, so a single person or couple would probably be better.  **Edited to add:** US only please, I don't understand exchange rates.   **Edited again to add:** Contest is closed. I couldn't decide from the eligible pool, so I'm having my co-workers vote on their favorite (I told them it isn't about which one looks the best, but which one they liked most). I'll be posting the winner and contacting them as soon as I get the votes in.  **Update:** According to 6 of 10 co-workers, http://i.imgur.com/UjhoA.jpg gets a pizza. Congratulations to awana56.  **Update 2:** Just waiting for a response back from awana56. If I don't get one from him/her by 15:30 my time (currently 14:30), I'll choose another from all entries.  **Final Update (I hope):** awana56 has responded and is getting a dinner later tonight. But, I'm also a fan of immediacy, so I randomized all remaining entries to select a secondary winner. Durden87 gets a pizza as well.	True

t3_sb0bj	1334511488.0	yocoltboy		[Offer] 1 pizza, if I can use my points for someone else?	If you don't know, Papa John's is giving people 15 bonus rewards points over the weekend, but they expire on Tuesday. While I'd love to order myself a free pizza, I really need to stop living off of pizza! I'd hate to see the chance to get a free pizza go to waste, but I'm not sure if there's a way to gift points. You would need to pay the delivery fee + tax + the cost of anything else you'd like to order. So if you want to use my 25 points for a free 3-topping pizza today, then give me instructions on how I can gift my points over to you or how to place an order for you. I don't have any money to pay the tax & delivery myself so it would be a cash order that you'd have to pay when it gets there.

t3_ruves	1333645785.0	endoflevelbaddy	FAP	[OFFER] Bit of an unusual RAoP, but it involves a challenge and comedy...	Ok, last week I donated a pizza to the person who made me laugh the most.   This week, I want to try something a little different. Since there are lots of generous pizza donators, I guess this may work.  Basically, I want the funniest joke you can muster up. You must make me laugh. BUT, I'm not going to pay the full amount for your pizza, I'll pay half. The challenge is to get another redditor to laugh so much, that they will pay the other half. To make it even more difficult, we must both agree that yours is the funniest joke. And before anyone says I'm being cheap, I have an adequate amount of money to pay full price for a pizza, I just fancy something a little fun with this community.  I want funny jokes. Nothing horrible like rape and dead babies etc. PROTIP: I love anti-jokes, but normal jokes are just as good.  Bear in mind that this might go wrong so please don't hate on me.  [Proof I donated pizza last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ri6sn/offer_my_birthday_is_tomorrow_130hr_time_gmt_and/)  Good luck :D  EDIT: Bear in mind, this may take a while to gain momentum. I'll give it at least, 6 or so hours before the winner will be giving stuff with cheese.  EDIT 2: Guess I was a little ambigious about how someone else will donate with me. If you like a joke and fancy donating, please comment on the joke and maybe PM me? Just makes it a little easier for me to see who is game.  EDIT 3: Come on guys, participate. I'm not doing this for Karma or whatever, I just want to have a laugh and have fun. GIVE ME YOUR JOKES :D  FINAL EDIT: So, my little game worked and me and another donator which goes by the name of of Zombica, have decided that the winner is [this beautifully epic joke](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ruves/offer_bit_of_an_unusual_raop_but_it_involves_a/c48vh57).

t3_rsaef	1333508781.0	tireurroyale		[OFFER] Red sauce for Red Stick	tlingr: (too long; I'm not going to read) I'll buy pizza for someone who lives in Baton Rouge, LA this week.  I first got in to Reddit when I heard there was a free pizza reddit. Since then, I've become an atrociously avid but quiet redditor. That was six months ago.  Six months ago, I was reaching what I thought was the end of a year-long rope as an unemployed (BR doesn't need tons of computer programmers) college dropout (didn't have the cash) stealing food  from my roommates to survive (I'm diabetic). In the next few months,  I ran out of that rope and had to steal from my roommate's insulin supplies to keep even marginally healthy.  Thank god, those months are over. A month ago I finally secured not just a job, but a salaried/health insurance one, at an awesome place, for good money given I'm a college drop-out. I'm mercilessly addicted to reddit, and my 21st birthday is just around the corner. I never got that pizza I was hoping for at the time, but I'm finally feeling good about life and hopeful in much better ways.  I'm still paying off a lot of credit, bank, (pointless) student, and personal loans, but my checking account is in the black and and I'm feeling like giving back to someone else locally. Unavoidable sympathy bonus points if you're in straights similar to those I was recently. Comment down here what you want and what day this week you want it and I'll pass on a little edible karma to someone.  [EDIT]: Gonna pick tomorrow evening, so my time frame is Thursday-Sunday delivery.	True
t3_rrjkl	1333478416.0	threedice	threedice	[OFFER] $15 Papa John's card	Listen.

I'm having a blah day, so if someone could say something nice to me or make me smile (clean jokes please), I'll pick someone who made me feel like smiling - at random.  Anyone who comments from now until 5pm Eastern time Wednesday April 4 is eligible.  I will PM the winner and ask for his/her mailing address.  Then I put the gift card in the mail and off it goes.  Continental United States only.  And please only participate if you have a Papa John's in your neighborhood.  **CONTEST IS OVER**  I wasn't sure how well this would work, but apparently it worked better than I anticipated.  I appreciated everybody's comments, they turned my blah day into a great day.  I enjoyed the jokes, the videos and the kind words.  So here's the deal.  The winner of the Papa John's $15 card is:   **1openeye**  However, since I had such a great time with the contest, I am purchasing four more $15 Papa John's cards, which will go to:  **drcazes** **bilbo_swaggins** **Pyrofusion** **SpecialKayla**  I'm just waiting for their mailing addresses to come back to my PM.  Then it's five envelopes, five stamps, and off they go.  Once again, thanks to everyone for participating in this contest.  Sorry I don't have more cards to give out; but I really enjoyed everyone's participation in this!	True
t3_rrbt8	1333469223.0	arrowsama		[OFFER] Free medium sized pizza, only valid for Spain	I don't know how many Spanish people browse this subreddit, but let's try it out. I got a few coupons from this domino's page: [http://yanoseacabaelmundo.com](http://yanoseacabaelmundo.com/). I can't use them because I moved to the US but they're legit (some stores *may* ask for a minimum amount to order with this promotion, but mostly don't)  So, let's hope I have enough for everyone!	
t3_rr47e	1333458623.0	scottydbiz	pizza	[OFFER] CONTEST-US Only "Pizza makes the world go 'round and is scientifically proven to improve your TV watching experience. A pizza scientist told me so..." Guess my fav TV Show, get a pie.	**********CONTEST IS NOW OVER. THANKS TO ALL WHO PARTICIPATED. LET'S DO THIS AGAIN. SOON******    So, Sunday I made a request which went unfulfilled, which is perfectly cool except I made a commitment to RAOP regardless of the outcome of my request.  So, here it is, but there's a catch (There's always a catch, am I rite? Ok, maybe not always, but in this instance, anyway). I am offering a $20 Papa John's gift card to whomever is able to guess my favorite TV show.   You could scroll through my comment history, but I deleted anything that may give it away.  That being said, while these shows are SOME of my favorites, the show is not:  House  Game of Thrones  Boondocks  Futurama  Attack of the Show  Glee  My Pretty Pony: Friendship is Magic  The show is still currently on air and that is the only clue.  STIPS: Winner must have an active account at least one month old. Winner must be verified by RAOP's Verification System located in the sidebar. Anyone PMing me will be immediately disqualified. If no one has guessed correctly, I will choose a comment at random and present the winner with his/her gift card.  Good luck RAOP, and god's speed.  EDIT: An hour in and no correct guesses. Some things to consider:  From replies, one can deduce that the show is still on air, NOT on Comedy Central, and closer to Desperate Housewives than Walking Dead.   HOUR ONE HINT: You probably have not watched a single episode, and if you did you probably wouldn't admit it openly.  GOOD LUCK!!!  **********WE HAVE A WINNER!!!*********************************************************  Congrats to schiffydick for guessing correctly.  The answer was Degrassi. Say what you want and downvote me to hell and back, but fuck me if i don't love some good, ol' fashioned Canadian teen drama.  Enjoy your meal and your month of reddit gold. That was no easy feat.  **********CONTEST OVER WE HAVE A WEINER*********************************************   ***********************CORRECTION**************************************************                                     WE HAVE TWO WINNERS  rwheeler720 had the correct answer three minutes before schiffydick, so YOU BOTH GET A $20 PJ's GIFT CARD AND A MONTH OF REDDIT GOLD. Fair is fair, and since the time stamp on rwheeler720s comment is 3 minutes earlier, he id the official weiner. Still, I told schiffydick he won first, so what am I going to do, not give the dude his spoils? FUCK THE LAW, I WANT TWO WINNERS.  Enjoy and thanks for playing  ************************PAYOUTS CONFIRMED******************************************** 1. I can't maths, but we still have two winrars. 2. GC's and RG's have both been delivered. I asked the winners to please post a pic of them enjoying their spoils while watching Degrassi since they both seem to be fans. Looks like I'm not a forever alone fan after all.   Thanks again everyone! I hope you had as much fun as I did! Pay that shit forward! 	True

CONTEST IS CLOSED.**    The secret number I randomly selected was **292,703**.    The closest guess without going over was given by **CheshireFrog**, who guessed **289,563**.  She made 4 guesses with 3 clues, and wins a $15 gift card!  It was funny how many 333,333 guesses I saw!  Oh, and a handful of *pi* guesses, 314,159 too.  I almost chose that number too, but decided to go with a random number generator instead.  :-)   Thanks for playing, everyone!  Have a wonderful weekend!  ------------  OK, we've all seen the typical random number contests.  I want to try to put a little spin on it this time.  I'm thinking of a whole number from **1 to 1,000,000**.  Closest guess without going over wins (Price Is Right rules).     **Here are the rules:**   I'll give out 4 clues to help you narrow down what the number is over the course of this week (1 clue per day, Tues, Wed, Thur, and Fri).  A winner will be chosen on March 23rd, Friday night (Central Time).   * If you guess **before any clues are given**, you can have **10 guesses**. * If you guess with **1 clue**, you can have **8 guesses**. * If you guess with **2 clues**, you can have **6 guesses**. * If you guess with **3 clues**, you can have **4 guesses**. * If you guess with **all 4 clues**, you can only have **1 guess**.   So not only do you have to decide what your guesses are, you have to determine if you want to wait for clues at the cost of having fewer guesses.  The clues will get better and better as the week progresses. **If anyone guesses it exactly right, they will win a $100 gift card!**  So if you want to play:  * You must leave a comment below and let me know you are playing. * **SEND ME YOUR GUESSES VIA PM** *(if multiple guesses, put all of your guesses in a single PM)*. For clarity, please include 1 guess per line in the message. * Only 1 set of guesses per account, and your account must be at least 3 months old.   --------------------------  **CLUE #1** *(March 20 @ 8:40am CDT)*: **The number is odd**.  Any new responses must now have **8 guesses**.  **CLUE #2** *(March 21 @ 8:35am CDT)*: **The number is > 200,000**.  Any new responses must now have **6 guesses**.  **CLUE #3** *(March 22 @ 9:40am CDT)*: **The number is < 400,000**.  Any new responses must now have **4 guesses**.  **CLUE #4** *(March 23 @ 5:00am CDT)*: **The number is prime, and sum of the digits is 23**.  Any new responses must now have only **1 guess**.  I'll pick a winner later tonight sometime, probably after 7pm CDT.  Good luck!   	True

You have to live in the U.S. (sorry... it's really hard to purchase things overseas because my bank always thinks it's fraudulent). 1. You have to really need it, meaning you can't otherwise afford it. So if you're just having a bad day, but you can still afford to buy a pizza, you're disqualified... sorry :( 1. You must go out of your way to help someone else, and explain in your comment what you did.

t3_r0vqa	1331999675.0	griffin8116		[OFFER] If I can get enough votes I can win a trip to space. If you help me accomplish this, I'll randomly select one of you to win a 10$ gift card in 24 hours. I'm doing this three times this week. [1/3]	A newspaper (Metro News) is having a contest and effectively whoever gets the most votes can win a chance at a sub-orbital flight into space. Judges will be polling the applications with the most votes, so you really can help me win a trip to space! Because of what region I'm applying in, there is very little competition.   If you vote for me, and post what vote number you were in the comments, at 12PM EST tomorrow, I will randomly select one person to win a 10$ gift card for pizza!   My entire life I've been working towards a career in space science. I spent years working at one of Canada's only dedicated Space Science and Human Space Flight museums teaching about the wonders of the cosmos. I do research in astrophysics now: I work on the VERITAS experiment, a gamma-ray observatory near Tucson, Arizona. I am participating in Mars simulations (I am the Chief Engineer for the Mars Desert Research Station's Crew 116) and in my free time I like reading and learning about the history of human space flight. My passion for this field allows me to do public outreach with the Astrophysics group at McGill University. I love being able to share my passion with others and get them interested and motivated in such a fantastic field. Being able to go on this adventure would be achieving a life goal.   The current post with the most votes has ~18,000 votes. This is nothing compared to some of the other regions (which have 60,000+). So, really, support from even a small part of Reddit can really help me out. I'm in second place with just over 2100.   All you need to do is go to [http://aventurespatialemetro.com/view/cs33](http://aventurespatialemetro.com/view/cs33) and click 'voter' (French for 'vote'). **No signup, nothing. Just vote.** Use your phone, your laptop, your tablet, anything!   Anything you do will *really* increase my chances of going on this adventure. The contest runs until the end of the month. It's one vote per computer, per day.   This would be a life accomplishment for me. Reddit, please help me! (If anything, please upvote this so that it gets more visibility! This is a self post so karma wouldn't be an issue).   If selected, I promise to do an AMA.   **TL;DR** : If you go to [http://aventurespatialemetro.com/view/cs33](http://aventurespatialemetro.com/view/cs33) and click 'voter' (French for vote), you can help send me to space. Post what vote number you were in the comments and at 12PM EST on March 18th, I'll randomly select someone to win a $10 gift card.   I'm going to do this three times this week; this is "raffle" 1/3 .    EDIT: I accidentally a word.    EDIT2: And the winner of this competition is **_silentheartsong** . PM sent!   PS, that doesn't mean you can't continue to vote for me (1 vote per day per computer). I'll be putting up the second contest tonight or tomorrow morning.	True

t3_q5of9	1330194991.0	fluxuation	pizza	[OFFER] Enjoyed giving someone pizza last week, wanted to do it again this week! 	Tell me why you want a pizza. The goal is for me to pick only one person, but I may do two. for sure no more than two though.  edit: **thread is closed, already picked someone!**	True
t3_q5lc2	1330190152.0	shaynagier	shroom	[OFFER] Hey Reddit, Ready for a TRUELY random giveaway? 2 pizza pies here!	So most of you have seen me around, and boy am I in pizza-debt! (Thank you for all the pizzas, they really have helped so incredibly much... I can't think you enough... though hopefully soon I'll have you all paid up!)  So I got my income tax returns, and now it's pizza-giving time! For my last contest thingy I had you all write superb sentences staring s-worded sentences... and today is just random! You comment, you qualify. Though I will use verification too.  How is this "truly random?" You ask.  Good question!   This is how it's going to work- You comment, you get an entree and I write your name down. Each comment (yes, you can have multiple entries) gets one "entree" to a maximum of 10 entries per person. Also- this is supposed to be a fun thread so if I can tell you are just submitting a bunch of times, all of your entries are disqualified. I will count "Re:" comments, but I won't count replies of yourself to your own comment if that makes sense:       Ex: Person 1: I'd love a pizza please!      person 2: You just got a pizza yesterday!       person 1: but my dog ate it- here's a pic!      person 3: That sucks! Hope you win      person 2: Haha! That's amazing. Sure hope you win!      person 1:Thanks... best of luck to you too!         for the example Person 1, 2, and 3 would each receive 1 entree. If they comment on OTHER people's comments and such, then they would earn a second entree- got it?  So This all starts now and will end at exactly  4:56 central time. At which point I will write your names down in the order that they posted, and group you into groups of 6. Then, I shall roll a die. That number will get crossed off, and written down on a new list, and I will go to the next group of 6.... and I'll repeat this until 1 group of 6 remains. The person that wins that die-roll- gets the pizza!  The OTHER pizza is for one of the poor souls who got kicked out in the first round- hence the writing down on another list who that was. Again, I'll eliminate these down to final 6, and that die roll will win as well. If it's the same person, than I'll roll again and that person will win.  So.. You have about 5 hours give-or-take. Let's chat! Random topic of discussion to start- What is something you should probably get rid of but haven't yet? Why haven't you?   See ya around/at 4:56!   Edit: ok, so I was going to write you guys down as we go.... but I think after it closes tonight I'll just go through, print out the thread, and group by intravals of 5-minutes the best I can. It'll take me a while to do the work, but I'm so freaking excited about this giveaway and I gonnna do it the right!   Edit: ATTENTION REDDIT: Hangovers are avoidable- and not just by not-drinking! When you drink be sure to include a NON-ALCOHOLIC drink and FOOD. The more alcohol- the more food/water. If you do this- then you should not get any hangover at all! It works for me :-)  Edit: Also, I can't believe that I didn't mention this before... but I'd appreciate pics for the lucky two that win!   Closed! Feel free to keep chatting- I've got a few dice to roll one at a time! Be back... later :-)   It's 7:53 here and I'm starting to roll the die... winners soon!    Wow! That took a while! First there was the writing down the entrants - [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/85UJs.jpg)  and can I just say the people who collaboratively "acted" out my sample scenario are AWESOME!  Then I Had to roll the die- introducing your Pizza-giving-dice of 2012: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lRqN5.jpg)  Which started the elimination that ended like this-  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ChCX2.jpg)   Then there was the 2nd pizza loser-gratfication contestants:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/9fimV.jpg)   And 4 hours later you get.....Hmskowronski as the winner at not-being eliminated, and the 2nd-chance for those eliminated first pizza goes to Lolsaniasaurus   Thank you everyone! I had SOOOO much fun with this.. and as I predicted earlier it is now WAY past dinner time and I'm starving. So I've PMed the winners and... that's all for now. Again, thank you. It totally made my day to be #1 on "what's hot" today. 	True

t3_pp1dw	1329225074.0	IdTugYourBoat	tugboat	[OFFER]{Valentineâs Day} Cupidâs a bitch, but hungerâs an asshole.	Yeah, itâs *that* time of year again.    The one day out of the year florists and chocolatiers make over 40% of their annual gross income in a single 24-hour period. Unfortunately for the single population out there, this is the one day hand-crafted by fateâs ugly hands to simply remind them of their single status, and once again pierce their hearts with that infernal sword of loneliness. It sucks, I know â Iâve been there. Being single on Valentineâs Day is akin to spending Christmas or New Yearâs alone; not fun. But donât worry, my lonely friends. RAoP is here to help you. This Valentineâs Day wonât suck, at least, not *as* much.  To put it simply, this is a Valentineâs Day giveawayâone of colossal proportions. In fact, itâs so big, we had to stretch it out over the entire day. Ah, âwe?â you might ask? Yes. WEâ**WE.** As you read on, youâll see just how many people came together in a selfless effort to make your Valentineâs Day less shitty. Before you continue on to the part where you read the guidelines (which, so help me, you *will* read) on how to acquire your pizza, please take the time to recognize this all-star squad of RAoPers who are taking the time to serve you.  The roster, in no particular order:  [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread), [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack), [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch), [jetboyterp](http://www.reddit.com/user/jetboyterp), [badbrownie](http://www.reddit.com/user/badbrownie), [chupanibre25](http://www.reddit.com/user/chupanibre25), [toncinap](http://www.reddit.com/user/toncinap), [overripebanana](http://www.reddit.com/user/overripebanana), [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), [tanyagal2](http://www.reddit.com/user/tanyagal2), [CheeseGamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/CheeseGamer), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [fordandt]( http://www.reddit.com/user/fordandt), [m2mu](http://www.reddit.com/user/m2mu), [kencater](http://www.reddit.com/user/kencater), [MonkeyHouse](http://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeyHouse), [Cacoo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cacoo), [awana56](http://www.reddit.com/user/awana56), [aghos](http://www.reddit.com/user/aghos), [Madamrimbaud](http://www.reddit.com/user/Madamrimbaud), [Supersized](http://www.reddit.com/user/Supersized), [Coasttocoaster](http://www.reddit.com/user/Coasttocoaster), [TokenFemale](http://www.reddit.com/user/TokenFemale), [Drolsonator](http://www.reddit.com/user/Drolsonator)  (Givers, *please* tell me if I missed your name.)  **Guidelines**  So, you want a pizza, yes? Simple enough. Request one in the comments section. To establish damage control on potential scammers, we would like for you to **post a pic of yourself with a sign reading âRAOP, will you be my Valentine?â** Also be sure to include your name, date, weight, height, professorâs name, course numberâwhatever. Get creative; itâs encouraged here at RAoP after all. Take a pic of yourself all dressed up, ladies can do an undressed version, do something funny, or take one with your cat (donât lie, we know you have one). This is *not* a joke or a gimmick, nor are we poking fun at your single status. We just want to see the smiling faces of all the peeps getting pizza.  One of the fine people mentioned above will contact your (either via comment reply or PM) and request your info so they can give you that pizza weâve been talking about. If one or more givers responds to you, please calm the fuck down. This does not mean you get two pizzas. The two givers fighting over you will settle whoâs gets to do the giving in a civil and cordial mannerâeither a rock, paper, scissors match via messages (best of three), or a duel on the following morning (one pistol, one bullet, ten paces). To avoid the previously mentioned conflicts. **Givers: if you have already gifted a pizza, please be sure to highlight this in the comments section under said requestor (i.e., pizzad, gave it to this guy, suck it hunger, whatever), so we know they have already received.**  **Protip:** If you can decide on the pizza chain you want, know your email address, and have the verification code (see sidebar) ready ahead of time, your giver can get you your pizza faster. After all this is sorted out, youâll receive your $10 gift card. Like Pasta, I also work and go to school, so Iâm actually forgoing sleep at the moment just to try and give a few out before I go to work. Also, weâre employing the 24-hour account rule for this giveaway to further deter scammers.   **Couples**  We havenât forgotten about you; donât worry, we want to show you some love too. Since thereâs two of you (and if my math is correct), couples get $20 cards. For couples, you will also need to post a pic holding the aforementioned sign, *however*, since I donât want the single people trying to get $20 cards by taking pictures with their mom, sister, cousin, uncle, etc., **your  picture must include you and your significant other showing each other *physical* (operative word here) affection**. Kissing, groping, banging (probably wonât be allowed by the mods, but you can still send them my way if you wantâ¦*rubs hands together deviously*), whateverâjust show us that youâre into each other. Same process, someone contacts you, you send them info, you get pizza. Givers: wash, rinse, repeat.  As one who is familiar with mass giveaways, I know there will be people clamoring for pizzas like a heard of zombies hungering for human flesh. Not too long ago, I attempted (rather stupidly, I might add) to conduct one on my own. Needless to say, I was overwhelmed in a matter minutes, receiving no less than a dozen messages every other minute. But now, I have an army of dedicated RAoPers at my back. More people will get pizza, more bellies will be filled. And if I told you the combined monetary pool weâve put together for this event, youâd shit your pants, clean yourself up, change pants, then shit yourself again. There may be many of you seeking pizza, but we are dedicated, resilient, and mere overwhelming numbers wonât stop us.  You will break upon this post as water on rock.   As King ThÃ©oden, son of Thengel, said: *âLet them come.â*  Also, we checked the fridge and pantry, and weâre fresh out of fucksâweâre giving out pizza, bitches.  **TL;DR:** Start at the top.  **Special thanks**  I would first like to take the time to thank all you givers (27!) who took time out of your day and money out of your pockets to help with this cause. Each and every one of you are more generous than most of the people Iâve come across in real life.  My deepest thanks and gratitude to [RobSpewack](http://www.reddit.com/user/RobSpewack) for coming up with the whole Valentineâs Day giveaway idea. If anyone who gets a pizza today feels compelled to pay it forward in the future, give it to this guyâhe deserves it. He was the one who originally pitched the brilliant idea when I was mentally toying around with planning a collaborative giveaway a couple months back. If he hadnât done so, I wouldâve ended up haphazardly hosting this event on some meaningless day. Seriously, Rob, I canât thank you enough.  I would also like to thank [DownSouthDread](http://www.reddit.com/user/DownSouthDread) who helped me with the promotional aspects, details, expanding the team, and host of other factors I probably wouldâve overlooked had he not brought them to my attention. He really helped nail down the whole âhowâ aspect to this endeavor and I really donât know how I wouldâve figured this thing out without him.  [Glinda_Da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch). Glinda, oh Glinda, where do I even begin. When I first contacted her she asked how many people I had signed up. I told her, and she replied that she had a few contacts she would try getting on board. Not even thirty minutes later, she messaged me with a list of givers to add to the list. Then more the following day. This woman can round up people like sheep. However she does it, I can only imagine that thereâs a fair amount of magic involved.  Last but not least, letâs give it up for our fearless mods, [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton), [snang](http://www.reddit.com/user/snang), [Cayuscokid](http://www.reddit.com/user/Cayuscokid), [Rollout]( http://www.reddit.com/user/Rollout), [moshimoochi](http://www.reddit.com/user/moshimoochi), and [PastafarianTwit](http://www.reddit.com/user/PastafarianTwit), who were gracious enough to lend their hands to this cause. Pasta also deserves our thanks for his efforts in promoting this event and coordinating with mods from other subreddits to get the word out.  **TL;DR2:** No, you have to read this one too.  Edit: Props to snang for putting up the sweet layout.  Edit2: Work now, might try to squeeze one in at lunch. People I'm still waiting on to hear back on, I'll check in from time to time. Other givers, have at it.  Edit3: Just checking in on break, looking good so far. Keep up the good work givers. Also, all you foreveralone folks, after browsing all of your pics, how the hell are *any* of you single? You're all gorgeous!  Edit4: Quick check in on break. Good news for requestors, to be honest, I don't even think we've given away half of what we pooled together. Foreveralone crowd, you should take advantage of this opportunity and browse the other singles, there are some lookers out there. Pizza and internet dating: the best of both worlds!  Edit5: Hey eensy weensy scroll bar, FUCK YOU.	True

t3_pi60b	1328815472.0	MoleDay05	PIF	[Offer] Giving back is a wonderful thing! (near King of Prussia, PA) (only USA)	Hi all, So I was one of the lucky ones who got a free pizza on this website, and I both promised and really wanted to return the favor. I just got my hands on some money, and in addition to other stuff that I need to get, I wanted to give someone else a pizza. To do this, I want you to show me some of your best visual work. Make me an excellent design. You'll have more of a chance if you integrate the letter "J", the number "3", and the color blue. I'm a digital media communications major in college with a passion for web and graphic design, so I know a thing or two about great design. I'm going to make this until 11:30 PM EST. If you win, I'll give you a $20 e-gift card to Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's. Good luck!  edit 1: I may make this a little simpler. This may just become a simple "explain to me your situation". I will say though that if you are a college student, you will have a much better chance as I'm a college student myself and I have a heart for fellow college students  edit 2: I am changing the deadline to 10:30 PM EST due to the fact that I changed my offer slightly.  edit 3: I've decided to add a second place prize of $10.  edit 4: If you've won, you will need to send me verification.I will be announcing winners in about 10 minutes.  edit 5: The first place winner is neon_neon! The second place winner is Damascius. Thanks to all who told me your amazing stories and your excellent designs! I really hope that you guys get pizza in some other way on RAoP! I hope and pray that all goes well in your lives!  edit 6: Since I did not hear from neon_neon, the new first place winner is xamblin. I'll be asking for verification.	True

t3_pfo21	1328669625.0	RaymondAblack	PIF	[Offer] Doing this again because I love a good laugh...	As it turns out, I have a couple free pizzas from Papa Johns. I just happened to be checking my spam folder and discovered I had old Papa accounts, one of them with almost enough points for a free pizza.  That being said, I would like to give away some pizzas. I prefer to cook most nights and I want to help people out. You really should be thanking PJs because they're the ones that gave me the free pizzas.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  **Contest for tonight is**: Make me laugh with a */r/CoffeeWithJesus* comic  Must use one of my [templates](http://imgur.com/a/xoKJp#3) or create one similar.

Random enough? ;)  **Edit:** No blonde guy from NY came forward to claim this, but the code has found a happy home with someone else.	True
t3_pfegf	1328657878.0	elie195		[Offer] Like Starcraft? Play me for pizza!	RAoP first timer. I'm just looking for a friendly person to play a few Starcraft 2 games with.

t3_pfczq	1328656097.0	elgreco927	dragon	[OFFER] I'm thinking of a word. Can you guess it?  Winner gets a pie.	OK, here's the gist of this contest.  I'm thinking of a 10 letter English word.  You will reply with a **single comment** with your guess as to what that word is.  As in the Price Is Right, the closest guess without "going over" (alphabetically) will win.    For example, if the word is **pizza**, and the guesses are **pepperoni**, **pineapple**, and **provolone**, then **pineapple** wins.  Winner gets a $15 gift card to 1 of the 3 big US chains.  If the winner is outside of the US, or not near one of those chains, we'll work something out.  **CONTEST IS NOW OVER.**    --------------  **EDIT:** Just to be clear, the "closest without going over" part of the rules relates strictly to alphabetical order.  The length of the word doesn't come into play.  **EDIT #2:** Hopefully [this example](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pfczq/offer_im_thinking_of_a_word_can_you_guess_it/c3owy1u) will clear up any questions about the "closest without going over" rule.  **EDIT #3:** Maybe I never should have mentioned that my word is 10 letters long, because it is throwing some people off.  But I'll sweeten the pot and say if anyone happens to guess my word exactly (very unlikely, since the entire English dictionary is in play here), I'll make it a $100 gift card.  It will be like when someone guesses the exact price in on Contestant's Row, and get to reach into Bob Barker's pocket to get the $100 bill.    **EDIT #4:** I thought this would go without explicitly saying, but **ONLY 1 GUESS PER PERSON PLEASE.**  --------------------  **We have a winner!** Alakani wins with a response of "Starvation".  The secret word was **STOCHASTIC**. *Adjective* - Definition: "Randomly determined; having a random probability distribution or pattern that may be analyzed statistically but may not be predicted precisely."  Thanks for playing, everyone!  	True

First person to come over to my house and let me land a haymaker (as in not just a jab) in their piehole gets a pizza.  I kid, I kid. Although, I really do want to punch someone in the face. But since there's no one around to alleviate my conundrum, aside from my wife and since there are laws against that sort of thing (actually I'm not even worried about the legal aspect of that, I'm more concerned with her retaliation) I'll fill this empty void with my next favorite vice: giving out a pizza.   Edit: Going out to get some food for myself, those of you who I'm still waiting to hear back from, hurry up and send me your shit so you can get some pizza.	True

t3_pe3j6	1328583660.0	justaboy	shroom	This [offer] is a little lame, but it's what I can do! Papa John's Pizza + Pepsi Max, all you need is the delivery fee...	So, I remain broke, BUT I registered for Papa Points despite there not being one anywhere near me with the sole hope of finally giving *something* back. I'll pick a winner pretty quick (assuming sufficient response) say 8pm PST (1hr from now?) based on my magical picking skills - if they happen to be around, Jetboyterp, XandaPanda, or IgorCherfal, as people who gave me pizza, have precedence to either claim this pizza, or pick  who receives; but yeah, barring that - 8pm PST, I will send the winner the promo code for free pizza goodness. This doesn't cover delivery fee, I don't think, but that's just a couple bucks.   Tell me why I should give you a pizza!  **tl;dr: Giving away the Papa's promo code because the nearest Papa Johns isn't even in the same country as me (technically true, it's across the border to canada). **  *PS: If for some reason this isn't a valid way to give/can't be made to work, I'll re-offer as soon as I have the couple bucks to pay the delivery fee. *   **GAH! The real world interrupted, I blinked, and it's WAY after 8 (9:10 now =/) But I'm picking someone now! Sorry for the delay**  **The Winner, Selected by the Magic Algorithm of Doom, is EfischerSC2!**	True

t3_p9wqr	1328310077.0	BradGroux		[OFFER] Free pizza to a single parent and kid(s)	My siblings and I were raised by my single mother for a good part of our childhood, and we never starved due to the kindness of others. I know how hard it is for single parents out there so I want to pay it forward.  I'm offering an email gift card to either Dominos, Pizza Hut or Papa John's (your choice) to a single mother or father out there. I figure a gift card would be the best way to handle it so you can order whatever you like, and maybe even tip the driver.  I'm new to this so I'll be researching your Reddit account, but don't fret if you don't have much history. I've been on Reddit nearly 6 years with only 240 karma. I'd love to see pictures of your family, if you like to keep those private feel free to PM me.  I'll need your email account to email the gift card too, so PM me. My Reddit name is my real-name and is unique so you can do your own research and see I'm not a creeper.  I have no idea how I will decide, but at the moment it'll probably be random. I'd like to give it away in the next couple of hours so the kid(s) can have pizza in their belly tonight, it is Friday after all!  Thanks!  EDIT: All that babbling and I forgot to put the value: $30  EDIT 2: I'll be making my decision(s) by 6:30PM CST (1 hour, 4 minutes) so people don't sit there waiting.  EDIT 3: I sent $20 each to [mymybabies](http://i.imgur.com/xtOcJ.png) and [rere9090](http://i.imgur.com/ZGxeD.png). Hopefully I can do some more next week!  EDIT 4: I received email confirmation, and both gift cards were redeemed. I have however, not received visual proof (nor do I require it). This edit was simply for those who "research" further RAoP requests.	True

Right now I have a little extra cash from tax returns, but I know at some point I will be broke and hungry, so I figured I will give away a pizza to the first person that responds to this post, in hopes that one day in the future someone else can do the same for me. I'm in WI, USA if that matters, dunno if i can order pizza internationally. 	
t3_p2x7r	1327925823.0	littlegreenrock	pizza	[Offer] $20 or so worth of pizza. Australia.  Conditions apply.	I really like the idea of RAOP.  I would like to receive a pizza from RAOP in future, but today I don't *need* a pizza, and I believe in 'you get what you give', so here I give.  (so to speak).    Conditions: Australia only.  I'm new to this, and I'm concerned about the difficulties of international purchase. Maybe in future I will attempt this.  Also, I have noticed that Australia seems to be very lacking in in the RAOP dept.; giving and receiving.   Sob story: not interested.  Everyone has a sob story, I don't want to hear yours.  Seriously; I don't want to hear it.  I'm probably just as poor as you anyway (uni student, poverty line, debts, blah blah blah.  at the end of the day you have internet so shit can't be that bad).  Selection:  Reply. Tell me: who, where, why.  I'll think up some crazy way of choosing based on this. If I was rich I'd choose all of you, but sadly I am not.   When: the evening of 31 Jan 2012.  You can eat it, or put it in your fridge and eat it tomorrow. It's your pizza =)   What: I'm hoping that $20 gets you 2 pizza's.  I'll review based on selection and stuff.

t3_oz6b9	1327677063.0	BOTW	pizza-gold	[OFFER] College kid pizza offer #24	Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to class we go...  I offer my 24th weekly drawing for a college student. Your name must be submitted by today (Friday) at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings time), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have had at least one teacher, professor, or grad assistant who seriously ROCKED.  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time (it may be a little late today...I have a job today which might take longer than I'd planned), I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ---------------------- **Edit:**  OK, I was a little late, and there were a BOATLOAD of entries, so once again, I decided to double the offer and gave one pizza to a Domino's fan (schuppaloop) and one to a Papa John's fan (Danimaltanimal). Happy Friday everybody! 	True
t3_oyit2	1327630447.0	chubawubba		[OFFER] Stoned and on a diet. Figured I'd feed someone else for a change.	Edit #1: Pizza successfully gifted!

t3_oxyay	1327605499.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[OFFER] US Only.  It can't be for you.  (Details inside.)	I did this awhile back, and I really liked the result.  So, here's the deal.  You get to nominate someone who is NOT you for a $20 e-card to Papa J's, Pizza Hut, or Domino's.  You must give a good reason for their nomination.  That good reason could be a sob story, that they're really cute, or that you just think they'd like one.  Whatever.  I normally do a random drawing, but I'm thinking democratically, so I'll let the upvotes do my work for me.  Highest=winner.  Fine print:  Redditors with accounts under 3 months are not eligible to nominate or receive.    Redditors who have only posted in "assistance" threads (think: RAOP, Random Kindness, etc.) for assistance but have not given back, contributed to other subreddits, etc. are not eligible to nominate or receive.  (This sound harsh.  It's not: simply, if you're a person whose only Reddit history is asking for stuff, ask in a different thread but not here.)  Redditors who are not willing to post a cute picture of their lovely pie are not eligible to receive.  If the highest upvoted nominee triggers any "sketch" flags, I may demand more information or some such.    I'll close it out at 2pm Pacific Time (5pm Eastern).    **Important Edit!**  Some people prefer to give and NOT receive.  So, I'll need whomever you nominate to either post on the thread, PM me, etc. to confirm they're okay with receiving a pie.  (It also helps me contact them in an expedient manner to get their contact info.)    **moshimoochi gets the card!**  **Last Edit:** Someone has gone through and downvoted several of the posts (not sure why, since the contest is closed).  However, at 2pm Pacific Time, moshimoochi had the highest votes.  You're just going to have to trust me on that one, as I didn't make a screenshot.  	True

In particular, a $15 e-card to Papa John's, Domino's, or Pizza Hut.   Conditions:  Must have *given* a pie before (I don't care if you've received or not).  Must live in the US.  Must take a picture of said pie so I can bask in its gloriousness.  Must give me a reason to give you a pie.  I don't care if it's a sob story, that you're just plain sick of your New Year's Resolution to eat better, or that you have a cute hedgehog.  Whatever--and likely the funnier, the better.  I'll send the e-card, pending verification from the winner, 'round 2pm Pacific.    	True
t3_oktrt	1326808774.0	scru	pizza	[OFFER] Dominos pizzas are $5.99 today, if you buy two. I can afford exactly that (U.S.A.).	[EDIT]: Pizzas are now spoken for, and three times as many of them as I expected to give out too! Sorry, pardners.  So if you'd like TWO pizzas, now's your chance. Medium sized, up to two toppings, and I can certainly send it over later in the day (when it's not breakfast time all over the country). I hope this is allowed, you know, offering to purchase specific pizzas when there are specific coupons available. I'm just a poor college graduate trying to give back a little, so be kind.   I will be more likely to send you a pizza if your response to this uses interesting cowboy slang.	True
t3_okj7q	1326781842.0	LetMeResearchThat4U	pizza	[Offer] I feel like making your day friday.	Friday the 20th that is.  Just post why you want a pizza. but i'm also looking to have some fun here.  I'd love to hear about a prank you've always wanted to pull using pizza.   so if you feel up for some fun and a free pizza for you and a neighbor leave a reply.   now if you also just want pizza leave a reply. 	True
t3_ojol0	1326743621.0	mishagale	FAP	[Offer] [UK] [Random] Two For Tuesday / Twoesday	Both Dominos and Pizza Hut do a deal where you can get two pizzas for the price of one on Tuesdays, so I thought it'd be fun to buy lunch/dinner (or possibly dinner/tea or even lunch/supper depending on class and/or location) for two people at once. Posting on Monday evening to give people time to apply, since there are going to be some constraints, which are as follows:  * You must be in the UK. Brit requestors on this subreddit can have a bit of a hard time, since international ordering can be difficult, so it's Britain only. If anyone from Northern Ireland or Guernsey or somewhere wants pizza, it'll depend on whether they'll take my card. * Your local Dominos/Hut must do the aforementioned offer. * There must be at least **two** of you. Both of you should have Reddit accounts, and at least one should be obviously "real", i.e. not made 5 minutes ago or have very few posts. You should also post a verification photo of both of you, with the magic word I just randomly generated, "YQXNHF", visible. You can send it by PM if you're shy. * You both must not have received pizza before. Like I said, it's hard for UK redditors to get pizza, so only fair to give to someone who hasn't had any yet.   At approx 12:00 GMT on Tuesday, I'll select one of the requesters at random. By this point, I'll need from you:  * Your address (unless you prefer collection, in which case your local branch) * Your PizzaHut/Dominos preference * Your order * Delivery Time * Your verification code  Bear in mind that I work 9-6, so I'll be doing the "draw" on my lunch break. If you want your pizza before about 19:00, you'll need to be prompt with those details, since I'm not supposed to faff about on Reddit ordering pizza during the day.	
t3_ojd8x	1326728596.0	baelion	FAP	[OFFER] UK - 25% off code for Dominos orders above Â£20	PM me for details, generated from Facebook's Dealmaker.  Says the code's unique. Is it? If not, I'll just post it here.	
t3_oj7d3	1326714320.0	user24	pizza	[Offer] No strings attached Pizza, but I'm in the UK.	I have no idea how this works (or if it works in the UK) but I'd like to buy you a pizza.  edit: Oh, yeah ok a few strings to curtail abuse. You have to be an active redditor and I should probably check this verification code thingy.  edit2: edhardy78 was the first to reply so if he messages me, he gets the pizza.  This was a first-come first-served deal, so the offer's taken now, unless it doesn't work out with edhardy78.  edit3: 21 hours passed with no further contact from edhardy78. I've replied in-thread and PM'ed them. Claim your pizza or it's going to someone else mate.	True
t3_oi5dy	1326650436.0	CompletelyLurker	pizza-gold	[OFFER] A mystery contest of sorts!	Hello people!  I'm in the mood for a little contest, how about you?!  Thing is, I'm not going to tell you my criteria for how I will be choosing the winner.  Once I've chosen, I'll let you all in on the fun.  So go ahead and comment, **ONE COMMENT PER PERSON** (unless you're responding to someone else's comments or to your original comment), and **NO sob stories**.  I don't really care to read them.  You can tell me any other story, though.  Or you can share a picture(s).  Or jokes.  Whatever!  Also, I'd prefer if you weren't using a throwaway.  I'll end this contest on **Tuesday Jan 17 at noon PST**.   *US only, sorry.*  Cast your votes, time's almost up!  Have fun!  **edit:  One of my awesomely brilliant friends gave me the idea of adding a hint a day.  So, here we go!**  *You can comment on your own comment as many times as you want, but it'll only be one entry.  Do this instead of editing, I want to see all of your comments!*  **HINT 1:**  I'm counting...  **HINT 2:**  I'm not counting words...  **HINT 3:**  I'm not counting anything in my personal life. It is Reddit related.  It is a common Reddit "thing".  **HINT 4:**  I suppose I have "help" with the counting, but I'm keeping track of the numbers shown to me.  What numbers, you ask?  It's pretty obvious to me, with a very small twist.  **edit 2:   I see some comments where people have nearly guessed what it is I'm counting.  It's not that complicated...**  **edit 3:  WE HAVE A WINNER!!!  MEECHPEACH!!!**  So, what was I counting?  Well, Reddit Enhancement Suite was actually counting *for* me, but the number I was looking at was *downvotes*.  The person with the most *downvotes* won this contest!  I got a little tired of seeing poor sportsmanship in contests.  People go nuts giving their competitors' comments tons of downvotes.  So, I wanted to be a little different, and show people that the downvoting doesn't really help.  In this case, it hurt!  And there you go!  Be careful of the downvotes in the future, someone might just steal this idea from me!  :)	True

Maybe if you're a girl with a pretty smile that would help, but actually I hate when girls get stuff for being pretty so maybe not.  Like that job where you hand out free cigarettes at bars, they always give that job to pretty girls.  But I digress... Not really in the mood to read about broke and starving people.  I know you are or you wouldn't be looking for free pizza.  I'll leave this up for awhile and come back later and choose one of you.

Winner announced at 8:00PM CST tomorrow night.**  Since I don't see a lot of offers today, I'm going to offer one. Here it goes: Are you having a bad day? In need of a pizza because you don't have anything but ramen in the pantry? Have someone special that you think deserve a pizza? Need a good meal but can't afford one? Having a party? Etc. Etc. Etc. -  I've given pizza three times and it felt great to offer/give pizza to those in need, so I'm going to be giving another one away today! I'm planning on doing this every week or so, hopefully, I can pull it off.  ###Time &amp; Verification: This offer will be exactly like last time: The offer will be over and the winner will be announced tomorrow night at ~~6:00PM~~ **8:00PM CST**, if not, it will be earlier. The only change is that *you'll need to provide verification if you've won*, for obvious purposes.  ###How It Works: Just comment! Yes, it's that simple. *If you have something interesting, like a picture or a story that would you think might entertain/interest me, by all means, post it with your comment. :)* The winner will be picked by a [random number generator](http://www.random.org), as I will assign everyone a number (that commented). Also, if you have a camera, phone camera, webcam, etc. It would be appreciated as I would like for the person to post pictures of the pizza. Again, anyone can enter, the account just can't be 1-4 days old. If you comment twice, unless it's a reply (which I will not count toward the numbers), you will be disqualified.  --------------------------------------------------- Edit: Sorry for the delay. I've changed the time when I'm announcing the winner because I will not be able to use the random number generator until I get to a computer. I'm about an hour drive away from home and updating this on my iPhone. Hope it isn't too late for some of you guys to order pizza.  **Edit2: After punching the numbers of the total comments (after hiding all child comments), [the winner was 41!](http://i.imgur.com/cQPpk.jpg) I sorted the comments by "old" and counted down, jmgeap, you're getting a pizza tonight! :) For all who didn't win but participated, I will try to do another offer next week or so.**	True

t3_nowxw	1324709659.0	CheeseGamer	pizza	[OFFER] [US] Five Pizza-eCards, Courtesy of my Random Cheer!	Hey RAOP! Never gifted before--or really been on here--but I'm in a good mood and want to give some people some pizza!  Specifically, five $15 gift cards.   Here's the deal:   1. You have to have an account that's older than two months, obviously for anti-pizza-fraud purposes.   2. You're going to need a verification code, and some other proof of existence if you get selected! Oh, and US only (sorry!)   3. Oh, right, here's a pretty important part: You have to actually post, either in the comments or via PM, your desire for pizza--and which type (either Domino's, Papa John's, or Pizza Hut).  Don't bother sending any type of story, I believe in unconditional pizzas!   4. Hmm, also, in your post, tell me... something! Know a good joke? What about the coolest thing you've done recently? Are you working on anything cool?  Hell, I don't care, just tell me something! If you want to say "I'm tired and I play minecraft all day"--that's good enough for me!   Stealing from the style of some [other people I've seen](http://www.reddit.com/user/BOTW), I'm going to randomly pick people's names out of a trusty coffee cup!   Remember, I'm going to be giving away five of these, so... your odds are pretty good! You want a pizza, you stand a chance!  **The drawing will take place somewhere in the realm of nighttime, December 25, 2011--I'll update my posting when it's all done!**   Oh yeah, and Happy Cold Time of Year!  CheeseGamer   **EDIT**: I'm going to try to respond to everyone! It's because I love you all, and thanks for joining/upvoting/replying otherwise to the pizzastravaganza! :)  **EDIT 2**: And it's 4AM, I'm going to sleep and will check on this/reply to people when I wake up.  Thanks to everyone for all your replies, and again, I hope everyone is enjoying the holiday season :)  Spread the cheer!  **EDIT 3**: Okay, I'm finally settling on picking pizza-time at [10 PM EST](http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?msg=Pizzas&month=12&day=24&year=2011&hour=22&min=00&sec=00&p0=179)!  I hope that won't be too late for the winners to snag pizza for the night... And Merry Christmas to those who celebrate it!  **THE WINNERS!**  1. rwheeler720 - Guess the pizza gods DO want you saved!  And I'm feeding into a WoW addiction... 2. will7 - Despite your use of a Narwhal joke ;P 3. foffy123 - Oh god, I'm feeding your WoW addiction too, aren't I... Darnit!  Nonetheless! Pizza for you! 4. chloh - Hey, you don't play WoW! (if you do, don't tell me)  Enjoy your pizza/rad vacation! 5. busybottombee - I hope you don't plan on ordering a blue-whale-heart pizza, as I now know it's around 1.2 thousand pounds!  Thank you to everyone for joining in on the spirit; if I had the money, I really would buy you all pizzas <3  Verification PMs going out shortly.	True

Apparently, it's Friday already... man, you'd think it comes around every week or something. Geez.   Anyway, all the college students are probably [home](http://i.imgur.com/MXK1M.png) and diving into their parent's food like a [little kid in a ball-pit](http://i.imgur.com/haUeM.jpg). But I figure at some point they're gonna go back to school, stare into their dorm room's empty mini-fridge, and scream up to the skies: "[Whyyyyyyyyyyy?!!? What have I done?!!?!?!?](http://i.imgur.com/5PKSp.jpg)". And so rising from their knees they will have to face a [new reality](http://i.imgur.com/LRCxc.jpg).  As a Band-Aid (registered trademark) on this comestible nuclear winter, I make my 19th weekly offer to a college student. Your name must be submitted by today (Friday) at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings time), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have seen a meme picture somewhere, at some time.  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. **You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's**. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ------------------------------------- OK, I pulled two names: one for Domino's and one for Papa Johns.  **The Domino's winner was: bdh008**  **The Papa John's winner was: -Juju-**  I'll be sending them PM's with the certificate info.

THANK YOU!  I've decided to make a down payment on the 10 pizzas I'm promising, and [sent a pie to chloe-bell and her 2 little girls](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/nkgge/yay_for_elgreco927_and_pizza_thank_you/).     ----------------  .  .  .  **GOAL MET!!!!** Thank you to everyone who made donations and spread the word, it truly is appreciated!

This is a contest!  **PRIZE:** $15 gift certificate for pizza wherever you want (or I'll call in the order for you if they don't do certificates).  **RULES:** The rules are simple. Make somebody's day on the internet. I don't care who it is, but don't try to scam me with alternate or friend accounts or you are disqualified. I don't care if you've gotten a pizza on here a dozen times or never, everyone qualifies.  Do an awesome random act of kindness for SOMEONE online and repost your deed here. It can be anything. Draw someone a picture they didn't expect. Post a simple and unexpected compliment. Do something that makes a stranger feel GOOD.  **DEADLINE:** **I reserve the right to choose the winner** at 8:00 PM Pacific time today (12/18). I'll likely be leaning towards the person with the most upvotes (but I may also go with the most generous act).  **NOTE:** Please no sad stories along your submissions. I won't pick you just because you did something nice while you were homeless or your puppies are starving. This is a FUN thread. Sorry :(  -------------------------  **EDIT:** I appreciate how many awesome things you guys have already done today, but I was hoping you'd go out of your way to do something for this post and not just list things you were already going to do.  -------------------------  **EDIT 2:** blaurum donated to Azlheimer's research and jnseals decided to donate two books in r/randomkindness! These are the sort of cool things I'm looking at (but please don't donate all your money, would defeat the purpose of a pizza!). You don't need to do anything that costs money, just make someone happy!  -------------------------  **EDIT 3: Less than an hour left and very few people are posting responses of nice things they've done for this contest. I think it's absolutely fantastic how many wonderful things you've all done already, but this contest is for things you did TODAY, AFTER READING THIS POST. Please make sure you brighten someone's day that you wouldn't otherwise have! :D**   -------------------------  **The winner is jnseals!! Hurray! Thanks so much everyone for the wonderful things you did today. I know there was a lot of competition, but there wasn't actually many people who really followed the rules. There were three contenders I could see who went out and did something nice specifically because of this post; jnseals did a book give away to a subreddit, blaurum donated $1 to a charity after this post, and wheeler donated in-game items to newbies in WoW.**  **I'll try to do another one of these soons so look out!**	True

t3_ncujd	1323896768.0	Kitio	pizza-gold	[Offer][Contest] Last person to post wins a $15 gift card to dominoes.	** CONTEST OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!**  Its been awhile since I have done a contest on here. Hadn't really had any good ideas for any until late last night. So with that here are the rules fo the contest and how you win.  1. Make a comment to this post. 2. Have no one else comment after you for ~~2 hours~~. 1 hours 3. Every time someone comments, the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour timer restarts.  4. There is an end time I am not announcing to this contest and person closest to that wins if no one hits the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour time limit. 5. You can post as many times as you see fit.   This is going to be some what hard to track, so if you manage to beat the ~~2 hour~~ 1 hour time limit, send me a message and tell me and I will go back through and verify. I do make mistakes, as does everyone so please bear with me as I try to verify winners. Depending how things go, the time limit may change to a lower amount, I will not raise the amount ever.  Usual crap I put in here, Read the right side, important that you read it because I will be following that.  Account MUST be over 30 days old, I don't want people making accounts just to get free pizza, contribute to the community and in short time you can participate too! U.S. Only. (Sorry people outside the U.S. here is a <3 to compensate!)  Let the contest begin.  Edit: Adding on, any comments i make don't count toward reseting the timer.  Edit2: Since I see some confusion, the timer resets on overall posts, not if someone replies to your post. Also, Time has been lowered to 90 minutes!  Edit3: So someone gave me an idea for another contest, which is going to make this one more interesting. Second contest it going to be the person that gets the most upvotes (RES is tracking them) from me (and specifically me) on the posts that they have on here. Going to make this a $10 gift card to dominoes. Since I can only give one upvote per post, post something interesting for me to watch or read and u get an upvote, want a second upvote? post something else interesting.  Edit4: To those sending me message, they are sometimes getting lost in all the comments.. So I apologize if I miss em.  Edit5: Since some people keep asking, the End time I have set is not going to be tonight. I wanna see if someone can accomplish this. I will end it some time tomorrow. I will also be lowering the time as it goes on. I will lower it once more tonight before I go to bed and have a time tomorrow it will lower again. No matter what though, please b patient as this has almost 350 comments already and its going to take a bit to find a winner. =P  Edit6: replies to posts do reset your count and since I put it up above, you cannot reset ur own timer.   Edit7: As I said in a post below, net went down last night so couldn't update time on here... But time is going down again to 1 hour. Currently the highest I am seeing is 53 minutes on time. Also, I am not trolling as my pizza at the top shows, I have given in the past (over 10 pizzas) and plan to do so in the future, I just like to make interesting contests.  Edit8: Back to work I go, time is still 60 minutes, I have decided to end it shortly after I get off work, Which could be sometime in the next 1-4 hours. So good luck! I will also give a 15 minute warning up here at the top. =P  Edit9: So I think at 650+ comments its time to end this... 50 minutes from whenever this edit was done, the contest will end. =P To clarify, its no longer who gets in and no one post after an hour, it is now who is closest to the end time that has been set.  Edit10: Contest over Winners are Mamayoda with the $15 gift card. and Reingding13 for the $10 gift card. - Taking a nap, both winners please contact me with a validation as listed on the right hand side. I will get gift cards out later tonight.	True

t3_naac7	1323735122.0	Stregano	pizza	[Offer] Random Act for some Pie	It is this once again.  Do something random.  I am giving one person a pie.  If you tell me you are hungry, or broke, or basically tell me in one way, shape, or form that you are looking for pie because you can't afford it, you will be skipped (no offense, but there are tons of Requests out there, so make another one and go that route if you are that hungry).  I don't care what you show me.  I don't care what skills you have.  Show me what interests you.  Interest me with it.  Be prepared for me to want to have a conversation about it with you.  If cardboard boxes interest you, let's me and you have a conversation about it.  I don't care what it is, but keep it random, and keep it fancy.  So, show me what you do, or something you like, or explain something, or post a song you wrote, I don't care.  Just make it something about you.  I will leave this up for a day or 2 (I haven't decided how long yet, I guess I am keeping it random myself as well).  So, come on RaoP.  Let's get random.  As I like to say (it is my thing, but if you want to use it, that is fine with me): keep it random and keep it fancy  EDIT: I forgot to add, I will decide randomly who gets it.  So do not think what you have to say is boring.  EDIT 2: somebody asked, in a slight way, how I pick who is randomly chosen.  What I did was wrote up a quick php script.  I assign each person to a number, and then run this php script 100 times (if there are a bunch of responses like there is here, I will run it 1000 times).  It is just a simple random number generator, so nothing fancy.  Each person gets a number. Whoever gets picked by my random generator the most times wins.  So while it is technically not 100% random since it is not possible to write a program that is 100% random, it is pretty close.  EDIT 3: sorry about the single day delay since I know I was talking about Tuesday or Wednesday, but winners will be announced today.  I got sidetracked since I am starting up a podcast (very early stages of starting it), and I did some recording for it last night.  There is a ton more work than I had anticipated for that.  It was midnight before I got done, and since I had to work in the morning, I just did not have time to plug you guys into my random number generator and run it.  I will edit this and PM the winners sometime tonight.  Yes, winners as in plural.  Since I said yesterday and I am a day late, I figured to make it up to you guys, I would do 2 winners just to show no hard feelings (I hope you guys can understand, as I had no idea doing stuff with a podcast would run me until midnight).  So, winners will happen tonight.  I can even lay down my schedule for tonight after work (I work until about 5 or 6pm Pacific time): I am going to Blockbuster to try and score some free blu-ray cases for the movies I bought yesterday during my lunch break (the manager was in a meeting, so I could not get them yesterday), then I am going home and immediately plugging you guys into my script and running it.  EDIT 4: I am setting up the script now.  I will have the winners, within the next hour or 2 tops (depending on how long it takes this script to run)  EDIT HURRAY FOR WINNERS!:  Sorry about that you guys.  The winners of this fun and random contest are bluedreams39 and hihi44.  Seriously, thank you guys for your patience.  This was very random, and if anybody wants to see the script I ran, it is very simple.  It just picks random numbers and I assigned people to numbers.  These 2 came up the most.  You 2 will get a msg from me for details.  Everybody gave me such an amazing week, and I hope the conversations I had with some of you gave you guys a better week as well.  Sorry if I did not talk to you, but I got an amazing response I was not expecting.  As always, keep it random and keep it fancy	True

t3_n8jzm	1323621976.0	CayucosKid	pizza-gold	[Offer] The two best art project ideas gets a $20 Dominos giftcard.	I've been way too focused on my organic chemistry final next week. Therefore I turn to you, Reddit. This technically isn't cheating because I'll be doing the work. Besides, the professor encouraged getting ideas from other people.  **So here is what the project consists of: It's pretty open ended with a few restrictions.**  This project should be created using any medium, and must be on any non-traditional canvas (No paper, cardboard, and no canvas). The subject matter is completely open ended, but the visual produced must be on a unique canvas that emphasized the overall concept.  I must be able to buy all the materials from Walmart - AND - and I must be able to do it before tomorrow (I'll have around 12 hours to work on it).  Materials I already have (I don't need to use any of them); clay, colored pencils, paints.  My original idea was to make "99%" using clay and after it hardens, glue a bunch of pennies on it. I was then going to make a "1%" with a bunch of $1 bills on it - the final object was an arm coming out of the 1% and taking the pennies off the 99%. I think this idea is way to advanced (and would probably take forever). I suck at sculpting anyway (but I'm open to ideas involving clay that don't need an incredibly amount of detail).  **This is just one idea though - I can't wait to read some of yours. I will announce the winners at 5:00pm central time.**  [Relevant picture.](http://i.imgur.com/SK0r6.jpg)  **Winners** I liked all of the ideas. Thank you very much to everyone that participated. Unfortunately only two can win however. The ideas I liked the best are from **blaurum** and **BrokeCollegeDude**.  I will most likely be doing my original idea but instead of making the arm out of clay I will use doll arms (a bunch of them - I think a bunch of them would make it look awesome). Thank you to blaurum for this great little idea that I didn't even think of. I will be sending out the giftcard codes as soon as they come into my email.	True

t3_n1brx	1323107929.0	4cornerhustler	pizza	[OFFER] Contest:  Identify the city this picture was taken in and win a free pizza.	I recently came into a windfall via scratch off tickets, and I want to play a game.  I want to give away a pizza, but have no interest in sob stories.  Identify the city [this photograph](http://i.imgur.com/Isnfx.jpg) was taken in, using any tools at your disposal.  There are some very vague clues for someone who isn't from the area.  If no one has gotten it by 7 pm central, I will post another picture.  They will get progressively easier until the pizza is given away.  If you are from around here I will buy you a pizza from the local restaurant of your choice or a $20 dollar gift card.  If you are not from around here you will receive a gift card for $20 to just about anywhere.  EDIT:  It is not Chicago, but those who guessed that are getting closer.  The person with the library comment is on the right track to a good clue.  Figure out what kind of library that is and you will narrow down the possibilities.  Second picture will be posted soon.  EDIT:  Still no correct answer, so here is your [second photograph](http://i.imgur.com/XMxR3.jpg).  This one is taken from the east.  The first one is taken facing south from the shore of one of our Great Lakes.  From here on out, you are only allowed one guess per additional picture.  Some people seem to think this is too hard, but that's part of the fun.  Stay with this and you will have enough clues to solve the puzzle in no time.  EDIT:  We have a winner.  **Billy_West** is the man of the hour, and one of my favorite voice actors.  Gift card to domino's has been sent.  Enjoy.	True
t3_n0lub	1323056206.0	discrepancy09	pizza	[Offer]back! - Paying it forward, just like the movie!	Note: I posted this in RandomActsOfPizza first because I didn't know this was the "popular" one so I'm just gonna copypaste.   A while back, I got a pizza from this very same place. I wish I could remember who it was, but I can't find the PMs any-freaking-where. Will edit if I find em. [1] http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/icay5/request_a_pizza_from_reddit_would_help_but/    I was in a really shitty place 5 months ago. No money, no phone, no nothing. Now, I've got two jobs, paying a car note, moving into my own place and assuming guardian role of my little brother (who my father also kicked out, wtf.) Anyway, I was thinking about the pizza I got and how happy I was when I received it, when I remembered that I never paid it back! How fucked up of me.  Anyway, since it's the Christmas season and my credit card bill (yeah, I got one of those now too!) will be being paid in the next couple days, I figure why not spread the cheer a little and get some pizza! I'll definitely do one, but I just had to pay my registration on my car and my deposit on my new apartment so I'll see how many others I can do.  BUT, I want this to be interesting. If I decide to accept your request, I want something in return. The best part? It can be ANYTHING. Anything at all. Delivered digitally, delivered physically, it doesn't matter. The only catch is: it has to be something you somehow acquired/created/spawned on your own. Basically, I don't want a link to some picture from the internet or something like that. It can be a song, it can be a thank you picture, (but that's a little boring) it can be a drawing, I really don't care! Don't tell me what you're going to offer me until I accept your request, to make it a bit more fair. Well, have at it, Reddit. Shoot me your stories!   Edit: the user who bought me the pizza was unscientist.  Edit 2: Lots of replies! I have to go to work (two doubles in a row) but I will be sure to read through all the submissions and choose when I get off at 12 EST  Edit 3: Sorry guys. I've already chosen my two winners. Thanks!

Your name must be submitted by Friday at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern. **I have a job on the schedule today that may make me a half-hour or so late...we'll have to see.**    1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must be taller than the period at the end of this sentence. (give me a break...I keep trying to come up with new "conditions" for this third spot, and it's getting tough!)  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also **tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's**. Those are the eGift certificates I have.

That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ----------------------------  **OK, a little late, but I pulled the winners. Yes, again, I said multiple winners one for Papa Johns and one for Domino's, because there were 94 entries this time...so I split them into two stained coffee cups, one for each pizza preference.**   **The Domino's winner is: Razor_x_Blade, and the Papa John's winner is Sub_Par.

t3_mwo3e	1322777566.0	coltranedis	pizza	[OFFER] One Pizza Dinner (Ontario, Canada)	It's dinner time, and it is snowy as all hell up in this prizzle.  If you would like some pizza then please comment.  I have one dinner to give away.  EDIT: Sorry, I thought I made this clear...but I was wrong.  My fault.  It's pretty tough to place orders cross border so the location in my heading was meant to mean that I need Canadians to make the requests.  Otherwise I have to make multiple international phonecalls to confused teenagers trying to explain why a Canadian wants to buy a pizza 1000kms away lol	True
t3_mwl6r	1322773759.0	IdTugYourBoat	tugboat	[OFFER]{CA} Bitch, itâs the holiday season, a time for giving pizza.	**Holiday Season Pizza Giveaway Marathon Extravaganza**  For this contest, youâll need fly acro-**Bitch**, I said *giveaway*; ainât no silly contest rules to be had here.  Okay, this is how itâs going to work.  Iâm going to be giving away pizzas.  Yes, thatâs right, *pizzas*; as in multiple, more than one, numerous, several.  To acquire said pizza, youâll need to:    **1.** Alert the world that you would like a pizza via comments.  **2.** After Iâve contacted you or something like that, send me your shit (email address and pizza preference) and verification code.  **3.** Wait in anticipation of a delicious piping hot pie.  **4.** Don a ridiculous holiday sweater so the delivery guy can have a good laugh.     At the moment, there is no limit on how many pizzas I plan on giving away.  Just ask and Iâll give.  I donât need sob stories.  I donât care if youâre a college student living off top ramen, a single mother living paycheck to paycheck with a dozen mouths to feed, a frequently masturbating goat herder, or just a lonely person needing some cheesy closure; whatever, I donât care.  Iâll give you a goddamn pizza.  I am by no means wealthy, so this will go on as long as I donât start fretting about my financial wellbeing, or my funds are depleted-whichever happens first.  Iâll give until my wife threatens to leave me, whatever; Iâm giving away pizzas.  If this breaks my bank, I donât care, because guess what?   Iâm fresh out of fucks.   **Disclaimer:** Iâm just going to ignore requests from accounts with a lifespan of under 24 hours because I donât want people trying to get me to give to them twice.   **TL;DR** Read it if you want your pizza, you twit.  **Edit1** This is proving to be more difficult than I anticipated.  I have close to twenty some tabs opened just trying to sort out who's who in the zoo. Since Iâm being swamped with requests, Iâve had to enlist the help of my hot secretary to sort through the details of the requests.  [Bear with me](http://i.imgur.com/6pAve.jpg), youâll get your pizza.   **Edit2** Holy fucking cunt-licking shit, everybody calm the fuck down. I'm but a mortal man.  **Edit3**  My hot secretary has graciously offered to donate **2 $20** gift cards to this giveaway (theyâve been only $10 up till now, sorry trying to give as much as possible).  Unfortunately, she insisted on actually holding a little contest for these.  First to guess her bra size gets the first one; first to guess the color gets the second.  You only get one guess, and canât guess for both (her words, not mine).  Also, read the fucking rules--waste of time when I have to reply to "what info do you need?"   **Edit4** Sorry folks, as of 2:22 PM PDT, this is closed.  My wifeâs really letting me have it.  Apparently if I keep this charade up, my unborn daughter wonât be able to attend college.  If your comment was posted before this I'll still get to you, anyone after that, I'm sorry if I wasnât able to get to you. Sorry I had to close it so soon, I had not idea it would blow up in just one hour. I was literally receiving 10+ message notifications by the minute.  Hot secretary contest is still going.  **Edit5** Mommabear0816 finally got purple; size is still up.  **Edit6** Fun fact: I now have my credit card number committed to memory. Also, 10 bonus points are awarded to rwheeler720 and RyenDeckard for thoroughly mind fucking me.  **Edit7** Kudos to RobSpewack for finally guessing 34C. Also, those of you who I've pm'd but have not responded: anytime today would be fantastic. I have many things to do, which may or may not include filing for bankruptcy and/or divorce.  Also, you all owe me pics of you with your pizza and whatever it is you did with it; that is all I ask.  **Edit8** Logged on this morning to find a multitude of messages in my inbox and **reddit gold**. The hell people? It's just pizza. My unborn daughter needs to go to college, dammit, is reddit gold an acceptable currency? Those of you who I said I'd get before this tremendously stupid idea of mine ended yesterday, hang on, I'm still wading through my inbox. Also, if you haven't received your gift card, let me know so I can call those pretentious bastards and give them what for.	True

t3_mhr4t	1321676886.0	Defiledxhalo	FAP	[Offer] (Must be in US) Guess my NaNo!	So, this month is NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month; look it up if you feel like it), and of course, I'm participating! Now, seeing as how November's almost over and I'm more than halfway through my story, I would like to ask YOU redditors a simple question.  Guess the plot of my story! It's not that original, but there's LOTS of things going on in this story, so the person who gets the closest/most accurate/most guesses will get pizza!    This ends on Sunday (Nov 20th) 8 pm Eastern Standard Time.   GOOD LUCK! :D  **UPDATE!**  This was a HARD choice.  For the record, it seems that many of you looked up my username and guessed my story from last year's nano. XD  (Which was a dark vampire story.)  So tough luck, but I have a different story this year :P    What my story is about (I'm REALLY bad with summaries): It's a utopian/dystopian novel where it follows a girl named Paper (everybody in the world is named after an object).  She's been having these curious dreams that she feels are messages & decides to try to make her dreams a reality, making her a freedom fighter in the world. Through this encounter, she finds a guy with a non-object name, John Smith, who she feels have been sending those messages in her dreams, and partners with him to break out of their enclosed world. The reason why she wants to break out is because everyone knows that anyone who breaks the law is immediately taken and sent outside of the walls as a "soldier" for this ongoing war (and never returns), and so she of course wants to investigate.  What she doesn't know is that John Smith is a government spy who views her as a potentially dangerous citizen and is out to stop her at every cost :D  So, when looking through the people who guessed, it was really hard to try to see who's was the closest.  It went down between **pookie85** and **eross2010**. You both have major elements in my story, even if it was slightly different or wasn't included in my story at all.  In the end, I chose **eross2010** because even though it wasn't necessarily about cops/serial killers, the protagonist is fueled by trying to get to the  bottom of a series of murders (outside the wall anyway), thinks that John Smith knows a lot of information which is why she's following him around, and there is a general love interest between these two people, but you know, death and stuff are involved.  So **eross2010**, send me a PM with your address and whether you like Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, or Dominos!  Thanks to everyone else who tried!	True

(Please don't send me pictures...I'll take your word for it.)  4) You must let me know (either via comment or PM) that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  -------------------------------  OK, once again, I had a whole bunch of names **(Edit: 59 entries!)**, so I split them up into two groups: Domino's people and Papa Johns people.

But to make it interesting, your request has to have some alliteration. It won't matter if it doesn't convey your need very well, it should be more fun than anything. I was going to try to do some in this post, but I'm not feeling very creative right now...  **Edit** Oh shit, guess i should have kept an eye on this at work to start getting ideas of who I'm giving to. Just got home, will start going over the entries now.  **Edit2** Alright, offers our out, thanks for playing. If you didn't get one this time, I'll probably be doing something again in a month.

They have a GOOD 50% discount online today too just enter 50THUR on your order to get the discount before 4pm  *I recently posted on here a couple weeks ago after getting out of the hospital. I was stuck home alone till family could get to me and help out -2 days later! Needless to say I had no food in the house (was hospitalized for like 2 weeks off and on) and no way to get any - delivery is expensive when you know there are medical bills on the way and it's right before XMAS plus you haven't worked in weeks!  I'm an honest person so I posted my story here after a friend suggested it. I instead of a pizza got some hurtful comments -from frequent givers none the less too!   I found this site to be such a good idea that I can't let it end like that for me. I got better enough to get a small paycheck so now I'd like to help somebody here out - I don't care what your story is cause I've been there too man! I won't ridicule you for it or judge. It's just sad to be hungry and in need of a meal to the extent that you need to ask a stranger for help. It takes guts just to post on here when you are in need so I don't need to hassle you any more than life already has!   I only ask that in the future sometime when your luck is better that you come back here and return my favor to somebody else in need -judgement free! = )

This is really only for families that are truly in need of this (as this subreddit goes). Share your favorite Thanksgiving memory and I'll choose the winner from there, followed by a PM to get shipping information. All costs are covered by me (a **$94.44** value).  Please make sure [you're verified](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/) as well.  Since this isn't done via Amazon Prime, and I'm guessing it's probably 1-2 day because of the raw turkey, I can only ship this to the continental 48 states. We can figure out what would be the best day to have this sent as well once a winner is chosen.  **Edit #1**  If you'd prefer a $100 gift card or pre-paid Visa to your local grocery store I can do that instead.  By the way, here is the company website where the food is coming from:  http://www.aviglatt.com  **Edit #2**  I've picked someone who I (and others) feel deserve this. I wish I could give to more of you, but thankfully someone PMed me and offered to buy this for someone else too. I'm going to send PMs to both people shortly.  **Edit #4**  By the way, [goudie](http://www.reddit.com/user/goudie) has offered to give the same dinner package out. I had 5 choices, and since I picked mine, here are 2 other people who I felt could use this:  1. MeechPeach 2. taransean  I'm awaiting **goudie's** reply on who he/she wants to send this to, but if anyone else would like to offer this dinner package to one of the above (or anyone you feel could benefit greatly from this), that would be awesome.  I hope everyone has an amazing Thanksgiving, and I really wish I could give more of these out to everyone who responded that's going through a difficult time, whether financially, due to illness, or the loss of a loved one.  Have a safe and happy holiday season everyone!  **Edit/Update**  User **goudie** has also offered someone a $100 prepaid card or the package dinner (I ended up doing a prepaid because you get more bang for the buck). A big thank you to him or her for doing this!!!	True
t3_m93we	1321045455.0	RaymondAblack	PIF	[Offer] Make me laugh for pizza	I wanted to give out a pizza today witha contest, then I discover because of Veteran's Day my direct deposit doesnt come in until Monday. I guess that gives everyone an entire weekend to come up with something to make me laugh. I will be giving an egift card to Papa, Hut, or Dominos on Monday (just in time for MNF!) to anyone who can make me laugh. Rules are listed.  * Must use one of my [templates](http://imgur.com/a/xoKJp) or create one similar.  That is all. In other words, tell me something funny Jesus said to you. He always says funny things to me. (If you don't know where this is from, or want ideas: [/r/CoffeeWithJesus](http://reddit.com/r/CoffeeWithJesus).   I would say most upvoted picture wins, but according to some people in recent posts, people cheat. So I alone will decide the winner. (Or if so many people comment on how funny your picture was then I guess you win) That is all.  God bless.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **EDIT**: Going with *Matt_and_Chelle*'s idea, I would like the givers to decide who wins by commenting on which one they like. If no givers read this, I will just make a decision in an hour (6:30PM PST). I like [this](http://i.imgur.com/J4pPx.png) one and [this](http://i.imgur.com/34zFb.jpg) one and can't decide.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  **EDIT** [IAMINTERFACE](http://i.imgur.com/J4pPx.png) gets the win. I'll have another contest sometime later this week.	True
t3_m8mt5	1321016248.0	BOTW	pizza-gold	[OFFER] - Friday (starving or not) College Student pizza offer.	OK, it's Friday again. Here's my 13th weekly offer to a college student. Your name must be submitted by Friday at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings time), so that's 2pm California, 3pm Colorado, 4pm Midwest, 5pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have at least one tooth.

You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ------------------------------------- **Edit: OK, I was late (I'm on a job and don't have a camera that works) and so I just pulled out the name... and it's KittyBear, who wanted Papa Johns, so I'm going to send him the eCard. Happy Friday, all!** 	True

t3_m5kcd	1320804339.0	Azuth	pizza	[Offer] Bedridden sick dude looking for some entertainment.	EDIT: Gift card sent to ChanimalCrackers.     Been out of commission/in and out of the hospital for the past few weeks with a triple-whammy of mono, strep throat, and hepatitis. Sleeping for 18 hours a day and can't get out of bed for the other 6. Reddit can only entertain me so much and I'm close to adding boredom to my list of life-threatening diseases. So, are there any websites/things I can do with a computer that can offer a few good hour's worth of entertainment?  I've already exhausted the following sources:  -Netflix -Reddit -StumbleUpon  I'm running on a Gen1 Macbook air so I can't really run too graphically detailed games, but if you guys know of any free/cheap, low-graphics, preferably multiplayer games that works too.  Person who posts what I judge as the best/longest lasting source of entertainment within 1.5 hours gets 25 dollars of Dominos.	True

t3_m2zih	1320630157.0	toncinap	PIF	[Offer] The Saving Abbey the Puppy Idea Contest! (Pretty Big Contest)	Alright, I will try to make this as simple as possible. I know this may look like a ploy to get you to donate to Abbey, a rescued puppy that currently has a $987 bill at my rescue's vet, but that's not all it is so don't worry ;)  HERE IS HOW THE CONTEST WILL GO. You will be entered to win one of FIVE $10 gift cards (hosted by me, not my rescue -- but I am passionate about saving animals, so it's all worth it) if you SHARE [Abbey's ChipIn](http://savingabbey.chipin.com/abbey-the-three-legged-puppy-with-parvo) and post proof here (screenie is fine), where ever you think would reach people. Twitter, Facebook, what have you. That's the easy part.  However, there are also TWO $25 gift cards up for grabs (I won one, and one I am hosting myself :) Thanks you guys!) if you can SUGGEST a fund raising tactic for ICARE to help raise money for this dog! No repeats; whoever posts a tactic first will be entered to win the $25 gift card, and the second will not. Be creative - we have a great team of intelligent people but I don't think we think of everything.  If all of Abbey's money gets raised, I may give out more giftcards. :) Why, do you ask, don't I fund the rest of Abbey's parvo treatment myself? Because they won't LET ME.  ICARE is devoted to their dogs and pay for all bills themselves, through the rescue. BUT they let me fundraise, so here I am, hoping that we can get the rest of the money. The interest rate on the loan we have with them is pretty high.  THIS CONTEST is open until the 10th of November. The contest winners will be random unless you have an especially good idea/creative share, then you will get a card. :) You may enter BOTH contests.  Happy Trails! Here's to awesome ideas about how to help this silly little three-legged puppy!  *EDIT: Contest will be extended to Saturday, the 12th due to some obligations of mine. :) Thank you for all of your wonderful support!

t3_m2u3u	1320620889.0	Cdtco	pizza-gold	[Offer] Tonight, I will E-Mail someone who has LEGITIMATE dire circumstances a pizza gift card.	I would like to give someone a pizza tonight.  HOWEVER, the person to whom I will be giving this pizza must abide by my criteria:  1.) You MUST provide proof of your circumstances. I would like to see an empty fridge, a desk full of books, a blurred-out bank account slip; anything that CLEARLY tells me that you are in a dire situation.  2.) You MUST use the verification system. Please generate a code using the verification system, and I will check it to see if your code is acceptable.  3.) You MUST have a VERY active reddit account. I don't want to see anything with little to no, or even negative karma. If you have had a reddit account for four months, I will consider sending you this pizza gift card.  4.) You MUST make the request HERE, and not by PM.  5.) After we have arranged E-Mail addresses via private messaging, and you have received the pizza, you MUST confirm that you have received the pizza. You will let me know HERE, and not by private messaging.  I hate to seem harsh, but there is a method to my madness.  I was first introduced to reddit early this summer by finding out about RAOP on CNN. I found a requestor who was local. But I figured since he was close, I could give him boxes of food that would last a while. Now, I don't mean to seem derogatory either, but it turned out that he was an 'ent' who was up to no good.  So I will thoroughly check reddit account histories.  **EDIT: 11/06/2011 6:59 PM PST (U.S.)** I have thoroughly vetted a requestor, and have fulfilled that person's request.	True

Your name must be submitted by Friday at 3pm Arizona time (it's Mountain Standard time here, since AZ doesn't do Daylight Savings Time), so that's 3pm California, 4pm Colorado, 5pm Midwest, 6pm Eastern.   1) You must be a college student.  2) You must be a Redditor with an account at least 2 months old.  3) You must have breathed on your own in the last 24 hours.   4) You must either reply or PM me that you want a pizza, so I can get your Reddit name. You must also tell me whether you want Papa John's or Domino's. Those are the eGift certificates I have.   At about 3pm Mountain time, I will take all the gathered Reddit names and put them in my old stained coffee cup and pull out one name. That person will get a $20 eGift certificate to their choice of either Papa John's or Domino's (these work only in the U.S., sorry!).  ------------------------------  OK! I can't believe the number of people who entered the raffle... 73 Redditors overall!  I felt bad that the odds were so low, so I decided to do two separate drawings, One for the Domino's people and one for the Papa John's people. [HERE are the results:  Realistically1 for Domino's, and Latino_Steak_Knife for the Papa John's.](http://i.imgur.com/UHKRO.jpg) So I'll be PM'ing both of them with their winning certificate.   Also, Cincodenada asked me to pull an extra name so that he/she can add one more pizza to the party! So I sent him/her the name of the third person pulled from the combined group. Happy pizza-ing!

t3_m0dj4	1320421316.0	CharlieJohnnie	pizza	[offer] I got this Pizza Hut gift card for christmas last year, and I'm probably never gonna use it. I think I'll do a little contest thing for fun.	Here's a picture of it with the scratch-off thing intact so you knows I'm not lyin'. http://imgur.com/RaJTI  I think what I'll do is just give the card (the number on the back so you can use it to buy pizza) to whoever I choose, with extreme prejudice. I think it'll be fun.   So do this; tell me why your username is the best most cleverest username there is, and if I agree, you get it. Or I might just give it to a cute girl. But probably not because that seems unfair. Unless she's really cute. Okay guys can apply in this way too, now it's fair.   One rule though, I want you to send me a picture of you with your purchase of pizza or wings or whatever you chose.   I'll make a decision sometime this afternoon. And I'm in the U.S., I don't know if the card would be accepted in other countries, so it's probably best if we keep it to U.S. only. If I'm wrong though, foreign redditors please apply too.   **EDIT:** And just to clarify, the name doesn't have to be clever, it's the story I want to hear.   I'm very pleased with the participation so far. I will pick a winner an a couple more hours, see if I can get a few more submissions.   **Edit 2** Thank you everyone for sharing your stories, this was fun. I chose NannigarCire as the winner because I think it's creative and for the bromance and for a funny story. 	True

t3_lxhnv	1320220867.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] Pizza to someone at work	It's the middle of the night in the US I believe, which is an inhuman time to have to be at work. Lately I've been working weekends and 12 hour days, which means I'm tired and kind of grumpy but also richer than I used to be ;) If you're stuck at work and hungry, post a photo of you in your work gear (face must be visable), with my username written on a physical object in the photo. I'll pick someone and send them pizza.   Offer lasts until I get off work (in an hour, hour and a half I hope.)   **Edit:** I would really like to give a pizza before my brain liquifies and I turn into a zombie. I'll be here for another 20 minutes if I'm lucky and another 40 if I'm not. Offer has to expire then because after I leave work I'm going to studiously avoid all computers/words/thoughts until tomorrow morning, at which time I'll be attacked by a ninja file with stabby knives instead of pages and it will be a fight to the death and I will most likely LOSE after which they will haul my corpse off to another meeting where I'll be trapped for hours and hours with no hope of escape oh god when will it end.   So. Pizza now or forever hold your piece. And I may or may not be on a slippery slope to insanity but Australia is very far away and I can't afford the plane ticket to come stalk you/eat your brains so your info, should you win, is safe with me.  **Edit 2:** My brain has commandeered a pirate vessel complete with pirate swords and launched a hostile takeover. I think it's trying to escape my head so it never has to deal with this file ever again. I'm not sure I blame it. Anyway. I'm leaving. Goodbye, cruel world.	True

So - I'm buying Toncnap a pizza but if there's anyone else on this thread already that can send my documentation of more than 10k of Credit Card debt (no medical bills or student loans unless you've transferred them to your credit card) then you'll get a pizza too!**  **[EDIT: Contest closed.

I'm stepping out for a few hours but will go through all the pics and announce winners.]**  I don't care if it's because you're a shopaholic or because you've got medical bills.  The 2 biggest credit card debts get pizza!  If your debt is spread out across multiple cards then cumulative debt still counts!  BUT - I'm only counting "verifiable" debt issues!   Please post the amount of your debt in your post in this thread so people know what they have to beat.  I'll feed the 2 or 3 most financially challenged folks/family with large pizzas!  You don't need to post proof here, but you need to be able to PM it to me.    Remember: it doesn't count if you can't prove it.  Your PM should just be explanatory text around a link to your evidence.  If you're a family, then please post a pic of the family too with  a drawing of a pizza so I know how many people will be eating.	True

Post a picture of him/her, with verification, and tell me your story.  I'll put your names in a hat, and choose a random winner for an e-gift card to be given tomorrow.  Your choice of Pizza Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.  The winner will need to also PM me with a verification code before I will e-mail the e-gift card.  Yay for pizza!  edit: To clarify the verification:  Just a picture of your pet with a note that has the date and your user name will be fine.  You don't need to be in the picture, unless you want to. :)  edit2:  Just to put a timeframe on this.  I'll let the pics/stories come in until around 1pm PDT tomorrow (10/26), then I'll get all the names together and randomly pick.

This offer for a $25 pizza gift card goes out to all past receivers who've brightened this sub-reddit with the sweetness of your Thank You posts.  It's a simple contest that works like this:  * You comment here with a link to a submission of Thanks you've made in the past.  The thanks must have been its own post though, rather than just a comment (and it must be in the past.  ie, before this post)  There, that's it.  However, there's a twist to the winner-selection process.  It will be raffle-style where you get 'tickets' for the draw as follows:  * one ticket for a text post * two tickets for a post including a picture of the pizza * 3 tickets for a post with a pic of you (either enjoying the pie or just with thumbs up or whatever).  Pics with masks DO qualify (you know who you are you superhero, you). * 4 tickets for a post with a video thanks (I only remember seeing one of these but it truly moved me).  AND...if you've received multiple pizzas and made multiple thank you posts then you can enter multiple times and have more chances to win.  This is just a Thank You to all the 'receivers' that make giving so rewarding!  The draw will be made sometime Monday evening (west coast time)   **[EDIT: Ok, I think we have enough contestants.  Here's the plan: I'm going to use the random number generator on my command line to do the 'drawing'.

Until then, tell me why you need pizza!  Edit: I have chosen someone for today. Awaiting their pm to give them pizza.  Edit 2: WOOT! Card delivered, this feels so good!

Because I owe everyone and their mama, I can't help out of this first check. Now that I have that out of the way, I guess the best way to do this is to offer a contest of sorts.

Making a trip to the library each week made me so happy. **The contest**: I want to know about your favorite book and why it has been so influential in your life. Whether you can relate to the Cat in the Hat or think Wuthering Heights is a great place to vacation. **This contest will end on November 11th**, so do take the time to make well thought out entries. Pictures or storyboards are welcomed as well, if you're that creative.   I'm going to follow this thread and cut it off if it reaches **50 entries**. Winner will be picked at random, but of course it helps to make thorough posts. Entries with less than 5 sentences will not be considered.

Although I have had a strange and awkward day, so if you can make me smile, it would be a nice bonus.  The only conditions are it has to be from the UK and from Dominoes, justeat.co.uk or anywhere else that will let me just fill in a form and plug in debit card numbers, feeling a little socially awkward penguin. I'm in London, but I don't think it really makes a difference.

t3_lbm72	1318561216.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] Pizza on behalf of the lovely toncinap and the very hardcore sierraechowhiskey	Here's the history:  * I made an offer [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/l3jhj/offer_for_a_martial_artist/) which sierraechowhiskey won, with details provided in a PM. (Trust me, he's hardcore.)  * Sierraechowhiskey generously asked me to offer his pizza to someone that I can help, instead of accepting it for himself. I told him there'd be a slight delay since I'd spent all my money, and he was ok with that.  * I won a pizza off the very lovely toncinap [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/l8zqy/offer_my_husband_loves_my_little_pony_the_new/), who was kind enough to let me pass it on to sierraechowhiskey, who asked me to pass it on to a hungry redditor, which toncinap agreed to.  So! After that very long history, I'm making an offer to:  1. someone who is hungry and who can't easily justify spending the money on a pizza treat (you don't need to broke, but if you can easily afford it, celebrate your good fortune by buying yourself a pizza!); and also  2. has the coolest* comment history.

t3_lariz	1318510411.0	Binerexis	pizza	[OFFER] Pizza for long-haired bearded folk	Greetings people of RaoP! This offer is due to something that happened to me the other day.   I'm a guy who has shoulder length hair and a long goatee. Whilst I was out celebrating my friend's engagement, he told me that his sister-in-law has a *thing* about guys with long hair and beards. For some reason, she gets freaked out by them, thinks they're freaks and all the rest of it. This is seriously not cool. So seriously not cool that I'm spreading some long-hair beard love to you guys.   All you have to do is post a picture of your long-haired bearded self holding a sign with your reddit username and the date in the format DD/MM/YY(YY) and then I'll get things underway to get you your pizza. The gentlemen with the most epic hair/beard combo wins it (basically if you have extremely long hair and a Pai Mei beard then you definitely win).  **IMPORTANT:** I live in England so if you're American, you **MUST** tell me what pizza place you want a coupon for out of Domino's, Papa John's and Pizza Hut. If you happen to live in England, I'll be using the Domino's site as the default for ordering online which requires you to give me some more personal info but I won't be holding onto it or anything. If you happen to have a different/better pizza place near you with an online pay/delivery thing with deals then I'll look into that too but please only online secure stuff.   **EDIT:** Ok, it looks like I can't use my card for American ordering. This leaves me with only being able to give to English recipients at the moment until someone can give me a work around or can check if one of the listed chains will take payment from PayPal or something.   **EDIT2:** My mortal enemies,the Beardless Brigade, seem to have downvoted this because they are beardless and suck.   **EDIT3:** Pizza was received and was delicious.

t3_l6iu0	1318207633.0	in2itiveact	pizza-gold	[Offer] Take a photo of you in front of this diner (NYC)	On my last trip to NYC (I'm from Australia) my wife and I ate at the Court Square Diner in Long Island City, Queens. It was good NYC experience fun, and was enhanced by my overhearing some bloke on the phone ask the person on the other end (in thick NYC accent) "What are you doing Monyada?" For a couple of Aussies this was all pretty cool.  Anyway, will always remember that diner and will now buy pizza etc for the first person (or maybe persons, see how much cash I choose to spend) to take a photo of themselves in front of the Court Square Diner holding paper that says "What are you doing Monyada?"  My standard terms: I want a photo of your pizza/or you enjoying the pizza when it arrives. I can't do gift cards so require your address and a phone number in order to arrange a delivery. You need to give me a verification code. You must have a reddit account that isn't brand new or that only exists to get pizza :)	
t3_l6gxz	1318203925.0	monkeyhihi	FAP	[Offer] Got some Domino's Gift Card Codes!	Not too sure how the whole process of actually giving away a pizza goes, but I figured I would give it a shot and hope that IRL karma grants me a pizza. I would use these gift codes myself but Domino's doesn't deliver to my college, and it would be too much of a hassle to find a way to secure a pizza to my bike. The quickest, best-reasoned responses get the pizza.  Edit: Proof pics, and ye shall recieve (i.e., post pics for added legitimacy so that I'm more likely to give pizza to you!) Edit2: I'm also going to be more likely to give pizzas to people who haven't gotten any in the past, so yeah.  Edit3: Both pizzas sent out!	True

t3_l598j	1318096827.0	richgiverguy	pizza	[Offer] I forgot about this site and "randomly" remembered it	I haven't been here in a while, but my exploring of the internet somehow got me to Reddit.com and I remebered this subreddit. I decided I'll make an offer.   I don'twant you to make me something, or waste your time with any of that bullshit because frankly, I don't wanna see any of it. But, I do believe in hard work, and not in people asking for handouts. I didn't get to where I am today by begging. You need to grab the bull by the tail and fuck it hard!!! Take charge!!!  Anyway...  I will give 5 pizzas, maybe more today. Just write something random and I'll give you a pizza.   edit: I have 2 ppl so far, gonna order, rest a little, then pick more  edit: I have 5 people!! 	True
t3_l54ru	1318086122.0	badbrownie	brownie	[OFFER] make my son (Lucas) like you!	[EDIT: We have a winner.  Lucas ended up going with the big gun in the sky!  Congratulations GammaHuman!  A pizza goes to you my friend!]  He's the judge of this one.  He's just turned 7 and he likes Beyblades (don't ask) and Lego.  He also wants me to mention that he likes guns (!!) and video games.  Please submit a pic that is taken specially for this contest so it should have the word "Lucas" somewhere in the pic (and not added after the pic is taken).  Other than that it's all up to him!   We'll be awarding this one around 4 or 5pm PDT today providing we've got at least 5 contestants to choose from.  Otherwise this contest may drag out till tomorrow.	True
t3_l546z	1318084559.0	badbrownie	brownie	[OFFER] Pizza for the tallest girl and the shortest guy	**[EDIT2: Well, hilariously, I've only had ONE real contestant!  One pic taken in a doorway for the purposes of this contest.  rwheeler720 is a worthy winner at 6'1" and I think many of us were pulling for her as soon as we saw the pic of her with the fella.  Tall AND beautiful is always enchanting in a girl.**  **But in the 'shortest fella' contest 7'0" Dashuhn would have won if he'd thought to submit an entry.  All that was needed was a pic in a doorway to be a part of it.  Telling me that you're prepared to submit a pic if I ping you to let you know you'd won just made me chuckle.  So, the guys contest is canceled and I'll open up a new contest today instead]**   [EDIT: This pic will run till at least 10am PDT on Sunday 10/9.  Also, it would be nice to verify the pic is you that it include a drawing of a pizza in the pic (so I know it wasn't culled from google.  ikaite is exempt as it got introduced after she entered.]  The title says it all.  This one goes out to the gals who get asked what the weather is like up there and the guys who got picked last at basketball.  The guy pic has to be of someone at least 18 years old for obvious reasons.  Here's what I'm looking for as proof.  A pic of you in a doorway with no shoes on.  The pic should show that you're not wearing shoes or standing on anything and the top of the doorway should be visible.  I'll lean toward assuming that all doorways are the same size, but I reserve the right to doubt you if the perspective doesn't look right.    Photoshopped pics will be named and shamed!	True

People I love to feed are any/some/all of the following  * Demonstrably needy (photo evidence helps) * Redditors for more than a day! * Good people * Teenagers or Seniors   I can be a bit of a pain regarding satisfying myself that I'm not getting scammed and if my requests for evidence seem unreasonable, I apologize in advance.  I'm somewhat imaginative when it comes to the lies people tell and I try to let my sense keep my hope-in-human-nature in check.    	True
t3_l4cn0	1318010751.0	Ignem	pizza	[Offer] Couple's night out.	Happy Friday, RAoP! The GF and I were talking about how important it is for couples to have an occasional "date night," and decided we'd try and provide some semblance of a date for a couple that needs one.  We were thinking an e-giftcard for some pizza, and we also have a couple of codes that can be redeemed on Fandango for free movie tickets.    Leave a post, tell us why you and your SO need a date night, and around noon central tomorrow, we'll pick a lucky couple for a Saturday night out.    We'd like it to be someone who's been a Redditor for at least a month, and standard verification stuff applies.  I think the Fandango codes are US only, so we'll probably want to limit it in that regard as well.  If you'd like to leave a picture if you two on your date, that's great too!  Thanks!  edit:  GF just couldn't decide on one couple, so we're going to give away two date nights tonight.  Congrats to busymommy83 and hawkeyepeers!	True

t3_l3uid	1317964481.0	Lobber		[Offer] Pizza For Drawing	I recently received a 20$ egiftcard for pizza from PapaJohn's because of this post I had made: http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/kt86l/a_year_off_going_pro_update/  However, it seems the giftcard was only good for use in the US(I live in Canada), no problem, I really didn't mind too much, and thought I might as well spread the love. So I'm here to offer it to anyone else, all I want is any sort of drawing or anything related to Starcraft. Preferably something simple, cute, and related to protoss. For anyone who doesn't understand half of those words, any cuteish drawing would be fine :D  PS: Nothing too hard, I don't want anyone spending more time on this than it's worth, I just want something simple for my desktop background or something. <3

If I don't gift you/anyone pizza, it's not because I don't agree with your philosophy/think you're doing great, it's just that I'm after something else.  -- This might be my last pizza for a tiny bit. Bills are coming in left, right and centre and I need to do some serious saving for a whole lot of (awesomely fun, but still expensive) things! That said, my self control is terrible so maybe not :P	True

t3_l076w	1317703640.0	sprileet	pizza	[Offer] (sort of) "Give a man a pizza and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to pizza and you feed him for a lifetime."	Ok, so maybe this proverb doesn't apply *quite* as well to pizza as it does to fish...  In any case, I saw that Amazon has a really great deal on [The Complete Idiots Guide to Pizza and Panini](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Pizza-Panini/dp/B005FOGGQS), and I'd like to buy a few copies for you guys. I just found out about this subreddit, and I think it is a really great thing that you guys are doing here. I would totally donate a pizza today, but I am currently _very_ cash poor.   Luckily, I do have a balance on some Amazon gift cards. There are currently 3 of these books left on Amazon at this price, so as long as they are still available, I'll give away all 3 of them.  I know that this isn't exactly how people usually give away pizzas here, but its all I can afford to do right now. It certainly seems to be consistent with the spirit of this subreddit, so I hope it is ok with everyone. If for some reason this is against the rules, please let me know and I will delete this post.  Logistically, I think that the best way to get the book to you would be for you to create an [Amazon wish list](http://www.amazon.com/wishlist) with the book on it. Amazon keeps your personal information (email address and shipping address) private... That way you don't have to give out your personal information to anyone (including me). If anyone has a better/safer way to do this, please advise... but I'm pretty sure that Amazon wish lists are about as safe as it gets.  I think it'd be fun to know that someone baked their first pizza with a little bit of help from me :) It'd be awesome to see pictures of the pizza that you cooked after reading it... so preference will be given to those who would not only be likely to actually make use of the book by making a pizza, but would also be willing to come back and show us your creation.   **TL;DR - I don't have any cash to buy you a pizza per se, but I do have an Amazon gift card to buy you a book that will teach you how to cook pizza.**  *EDIT: I'm heading to bed now, so I won't check this again until sometime tomorrow morning. At that time, I'll do what I can to fulfill several requests. Since the current Amazon price is so low, I'd really love to buy them for people at this price before they sell out (and before I run out of money). I've already committed to sending one to prances_with_pantses, and hopefully at least a couple more people indicate their interest before they are gone.*  *If there happen to be more requests than I can fulfill, then I'll decide who to give to (roughly) based on the following:*  *1) Will I be able to buy the book for you before they sell out? (If you already have an Amazon wish list set up that includes the book, that'd help expedite the process. Don't post any personal information, but as long as your wishlist doesn't include personal information and you are comfortable doing so, you could PM or post a link to it.)*  *2) Will you actually make use of the book and cook a pizza? (If so, Great! I'd love to hear that it won't just end up sitting on a shelf.)*  *3) Are you willing to post a picture of and/or story about the first pizza you bake after receiving the book? (If so, I'd love to hear about it, so let me know whether I can to expect to receive a follow-up post sometime in the future)*  *Anyway, if you'd like to receive a book, just go ahead and leave a comment indicating so. I'll send what I can tomorrow morning.*  *I know it isn't much, but I hope that a few of you are able to enjoy this random act of pizza (cookbooks).*   	True

t3_kxmv9	1317492106.0	TeaInfusedInsanity	pizza	[OFFER] Complete the list! Open until late Monday PM east Aussie time.	Hello RAoP!  This is somewhat of a photo scavenger hunt, somewhat of an offer, and generally something to keep me entertained. This coming Monday is an Australian public holiday, and i've somehow managed to score a shift on the day in question, which is not only an extra shift, but overtime pay. So to celebrate, and with a list of a few things as requests, *n* Pizzas or gift cards will be sent out/decided upon [late Monday night Canberra time](http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Canberra+time) (for Tuesday midday/evening delivery, in the case of fresh pizza- gift cards will be sent out immediately) anywhere where Aussie credit cards are accepted.   My requests? 1. Photograph of a coat hanger hanging from a nearby street or traffic sign (if any). 2. Favourite mobile website (work is slow, and when there are no customers around, mobile internet can be a sanity-saver, and once again, if any). 3. Photograph of your feet (if any). 4. Side on view of your post-box (if possible). 5. The colour of your towel. 6. The number of pillows that you sleep with. 7. The title of the book nearest to you. 8. If you are a Tea drinker, the type of tea you preferably indulge in. 9. If you are a coffee drinker, how you generally prepare your coffee (e.g. instant, manual machine, plunger, automatic machine etc). Instant pizza wish granting if you have one of the machines from the company i work for! 10. A brief description of the weather at time of posting (country may help with this one).  Of course, thought went into these ten requests, by no means did I just pick out random items from around my room. And it's an entire extra day's work for which i don't really need the pay, so i would be most happy to give out multiple pizzas/gift cards. And if you do end up with a pizza, pics would be lovely. :)  Edit: Thank you everyone for entering! As a summary, pizzas for tazzin, ragnaroktog, hett, and Matt_and_Chelle!	True

t3_kwdx8	1317385120.0	Collaterlie_Sisters	PIF	[OFFER] A Friday night pizzazza to one of you! (UK only, as we often get neglected)	As promised previously, I want to gift a pizza to a hungry hippo as a thanks for this community being SO DAMN COOL. The important bit - the qualifier:  We all like to see the fruit of our labours, and on RAoP most posters ask for a photo of the spoils once it's been received. This isn't good enough for me, I don't goddamn trust you, so to qualify you must do the following...  Post a photo of you enjoying the pizza you do not yet have. It has to be the exact photo you would post if you had, in fact, got the pizza, but I'm requesting to see it beforehand so we're clear on everything. If you want to post a photo once you get the pizza, great, do it for the karma.  I get home at 6.30 and I'll pick a winner then - it'll be a dominoes or something, no gift card, just straight up phone-in a delivery to you. So you'll need to be comfortable giving me your address. Don't worry, I'm too lazy to go to my own friends houses, let alone a RAoPtor's.  Ps: I like cats, that'll score extra points. GO!  **Edit:** I'll be back home in 30 mins, at which point [one of you *will* get pizza](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01418/sugar_1418175c.jpg). Also, thank you [AdamBs](http://www.reddit.com/user/AdamBs) for the Reddit gold!! :D  **Final edit:** I've decided. :) Thanks all, have a good evening and keep RAoPing!	True

t3_kv9bv	1317303933.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] Shitty day 	Although parts of today were good, enough shitty things happened that today was the worst day in quite awhile. To prove that bad luck happens on threes, today included: a (minor) car accident, news of someone dear's imminent death from cancer and the potential crushing of an ideology held for a very long time (it's complicated).   So. Maybe making someone's day better with pizza will make today a bit more worthwhile. A few conditions, though:  1) it's nearly midnight here so I won't be sending any pizza out for 12 hours or so, maybe a bit less.   2) I don't know what my requirements are. I'll just pick a request that feels right.   3) if nothing feels right, I'm going to be a b!tch and not give pizza to anyone.   Live long and prosper.   **Edit:** Thank you all for your kindness <3 I realised this morning it was quite a whiny post but you were lovely about it anyway.	True

What is the contest, you ask?    Well, good question!  Remember Moe the Camel?  Here is a picture to refresh your memory:  http://i.imgur.com/mB1CE.jpg  There have been many pictures of Moe: as Captain Picard, as The Doctor, with his wife Moeina, as Sherlock Holmes, in a cave.  This was the original, however.   The contest is this:  Draw a picture of Moe.  In a costume.  Doing something.  Draw him like I do, or draw him more realistic, or more ridiculous.  But draw him.  Most upclicks will when, or if that is a tie I will use a randomizer.    Have fun, and don't forget to include his 38 tails like I sometimes do.    EDIT:  Oh, and I already purchased the cards from cashstar last night, so you won't have that pesky wait time.  Fun for me AND for you!    EDIT 2:  Winner by BOTH randomizer AND upclicks is urmomwasabadlay with Moe as the Jimmy John's Delivery Cyclist!  PM me and I will send you your card! :)  If I don't hear from you in an hour, however,  the code will go to the next person on the list out of fairness. - CLAIMED.

t3_kthvm	1317166815.0	whatsadigg		[Offer] Looking to help out in southern CA	I went through the new posts, but I didn't see any requests in the area.   I'd prefer to give this to a struggling family that cannot afford to eat anything rather than a single guy who's tired of ramen.   My mom was a single mom and I know how hard it can be to put pleasing food on the table for your kids. We used to get the $5 take and bake pizzas from the super market as our special treat once a month... And I had the audacity to complain.    So please someone take me up on this offer so I can stop feeling like such an ungrateful piece of shit. Thanks.   P.S.

GO PHILLIES!**  In the spirit of the post season being just a few days away, I'd like to offer a pizza to a Phillies fan. I'm not super rich, but I've received before and want to pay it back. Here are my requirements-  *Take a pic of yourself in your Phillies gear with my name/date somewhere in it. Your best GAME FACE will definitely get you points. As will the jersey(s) of my favorite player(s).  *I'm going to order a pizza to your house, or if you can pick it up, I'll throw something else in. If you aren't comfortable with it, then this isn't the offer for you.  I know this is a lot to ask, but I've been scammed before and that's a crappy feeling.  LET'S GO PHILLIES!  I'll leave this up until Fri.  Edit: Won't be able to send a pizza until Sat due to family matters. I apologize for the delay. Sat afternoon definitely.	True
t3_ksuwq	1317124940.0	in2itiveact	pizza-gold	[Offer] I am drunk. Let me buy you a pizza.	Figure it's dinner or lunch time somewhere in the world. Who wants a pizza (and then some)?  Conditions: I'm in Australia and can't do gift cards. This means I will need your address and phone number. Not comfortable giving that out? Move on. This must be sorted soon. I will go to bed within the next hour and a half. That said, there's nothing to stop me from setting up a future order if you're keen but it isn't pizza time right now. Verification is a must. PHOTOS. I don't know about any other pizza giver, but for me part of the satisfaction of giving is seeing a photo of either the spoils or the recipient enjoying the spoils. If you can't or won't post a photo of that, then move on. Two of my recent giftees have said they'll post pictures and then haven't. Most annoying. Don't be that guy/gal.  Other than that, giddy up. Who is keen? Multiple pizzas may be given out depending on response levels and quality of said responses.  Edit: should have edited this earlier... But gave out two pizzas (menmybabies and Tabor91) and then passed out, so this offer is done with. Until next time....!	True

t3_kmv2w	1316622523.0	0bi	pizza	[Offer] Pizza, first one to solve the riddle in the post.	Hi, I'm located in the Netherlands. That means I can buy pizza for someone here, or anywhere in the world,  ## as long as I can pay with paypal.  (of course, I can buy for anyone somewhere in the Netherlands, don't need paypal for that.)  ### The riddle:  A couple throws a dinner party. They invite 4 other couples. All the guests arrive at the same time. Everyone present greets all others (once), except their partner. Greeting can be done in several ways: by waving, nodding etc. **or by shaking hands**.  During dinner the host asks his messmates how many hands they've shaken (so **not** how many people they've greeted). Everybody replies with a different number (of hands they've shaken).   Question: How many hands did the **hostess** shake?  First one to answer correctly (with explanation) gets pizza!  [EDIT]  Please post your location in your reply, that way I can research for possible ways of payment. I will require use of the verification system.    [EDIT] [EDIT]  ### The correct answer has been given multiple times. Order of send-ins: 1. punkkitten8511 2. gimpz 3. fatalillusion 4. garseed 5. mumof2girls 6. Miss_Bee  ### Send me your locations, and I'll work on the pizza, starting from the top (i.e. if I can't get the pizza to punkkitten I'll try gimpz etc.).   [EDIT][EDIT][EDIT]  ### Turns out I can only order directly with paypal in the UK. That means that fatalillusion is the lucky winner. I now know this, I'll specify next time in the post. Sorry punkkitten and gimpz, if I ever get a creditcard I'll get you a pizza.	True

But I can offer steak in Morgantown, WV	Dang it, I forgot my user name and password AGAIN, but I got a free pizza here a few weeks ago. I'd like to repay the favor, but I'm most always penniless. Anyhow, I signed up for one of the 1 million free steak dinners that Outback Steakhouse gave away, and I got the certificate for it last Friday. It's only valid Mon-Thurs and they only open at 4pm. And it's only for a 6oz steak and 1 side, with the option of adding on chicken, fish or shrimp for $4. As much as I would love to have it, the conditions are for eat-in only and not take out. So with that considered, I've decided to offer it to someone who could get a drink and/or an appetizer with it. I wish I could get an appetizer there but I can't even afford to get a Coke with it, so it just makes me feel bad. Anyone want a steak?

Following up on thread here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/khznc/offer_payday_pizza_offer_remains_open_til_7pm/ with a second pizza.  Still considering some of the requestors from that thread. (I have an ongoing random-determination list of names)  As before, let me know why you deserve it.  Be hilarious, random, weird... but most importantly show EFFORT, and do your best to post something that everyone else reading the thread will enjoy.  Upvote people you think deserve pizza, I may take public opinion into account.  CLARIFICATION - I am not only offering it to people in the Western US, I just figured closing my previous one at 7pm eastern would be too early for people in other time zones.  The pizza is offered to anyone who has an open pizza place nearby.  WINNER - ~~by random drawing from the short list I picked - rdcarlson for sharing lovely artwork and designs!  Arranging details by PM.~~  ~~Sadly, rdcarlson was not available to recieve pizza - AllieOops wins on re-draw for her positive attitude and good karma from past & current giving!~~  Apparently I am having trouble giving away pizza.  Notifying all the multiple people on my list - ~~first to respond with a verification code and location & preference will get it.~~  Pizza goes to Blinkworks, for faaabulous Thor drawings! :)	True
t3_ki6fx	1316215463.0	gsf4lyfe	pizza	[Offer] Paycheck pizza	It's Friday and I just got my bi-weekly check and I feel like spending some of it on you guys! The person that posts the thing that I find the funniest before I leave work (in 2.5 hours) will get a $15 e-gift card to one of the big pizza chains. Don't care why you want the pizza, don't want to know. If you post any sort of backstory you will be ineligible. Also I will not give it to posters with brand new accounts, or posters who only post on RAoP. Make me smile!  EDIT: Very important - My work PC doesn't have speakers so videos are a no go. Images, jokes and articles are what I'm looking for.  EDIT #2: I will be closing the contest in 20 minutes (9:40 PM EST), I know it's a little early but it looks like I'm leaving work a little early   FINAL EDIT: scurvybeard wins!	True
t3_ki0yu	1316205223.0	desert_girl	pizza	[OFFER] It's Friday and I got some good news yesterday so I'm sharing a pie	An e-card through one of the big 3 is going to be easiest.

Doing this a few hours in advance so there's time to accumulate requests.  I'll probably make a decision around 7pm Eastern.  Tell me why you deserve pizza.  DO provide detail and supporting evidence, in the form of photos, clever storytelling, rage comics, cool links, or whatever you've got.  Sob stories are okay but not the only way to get pizza.  Humor is good.  Serious randomness is better.  Describe your request with a haiku or limerick or rage comic.  Or something amazing I haven't even anticipated.  I intend to reward effort and creativity.  Don't PM me, respond here.  I'll PM you if I want any PM details from you.  I might do two if I can't decide on just one.  Please be ready to verify (http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/).  If I like your request I'll PM you requesting you do so.  (Oh, and be sure to upvote any responses you find entertaining - the goal is the provide cool random stuff for everyone to enjoy)  Update - I was late getting home from work so I am overdue picking a winner.  I have narrowed it down to a handful and will be randomly determining from those.    WINNER IS: ~~mattmagician!~~  (EDIT - ~~IF he responds soon, otherwise I roll again~~ He did not.  Winner is Blaurum, for Moe the Camel!) (Additional Update - and after a more than 2-hour long TRIAL of being denied by Dominoes Gift Card customer service and a delivery person getting lost, the pizza has been delivered!)  Congratulations mattmagician, random number generated chose the option I wrote in as "Whoever has the most upvotes", and it is you!  We can arrange the details via PM  Starting a new thread here for a 2nd Pizza, choosing in 3-4 hours: http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ki6jh/offer_once_more_with_feeling_this_one_open_til_10/  Everyone on this thread that made my shortlist will stay on it for the 2nd drawing.

Ok, so this is my first post to RAOP, so to mark the occasion I'm giving away a $20 gift card to your pizza chain of choice to the first person who can explain how to fly according to a certain Douglas Adams book. Not looking for an exact quote, just someone who knows the general idea. I won't be able to fulfill this until sometime after 5 P.M. EST though. I really love the idea of this subreddit. Looking forward to getting involved :). Have a good day everyone.  UPDATE: congrats to cmh324 foranswering correctly first! For those interested, the full explaination of how to fly is in the book " life, the Universe, and Everything" by Douglas Adams and it's quite amusing. It's a part of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. I highly reccommend them if you like silly but intelligent humor. Have a nice day everyone and thanks for the welcomes :)	True

t3_kfuhx	1316039265.0	mrautomatic17	pizza	[OFFER] TO THE PERSON WHO LOOKS MOST LIKE BILLY MAYS!	So here's the deal, I'm a fourth year college student and I'm broke as hell (obviously, college is expensive) BUT just got my loan refund check deposited into the bank today. CA CHING!  I've always wanted to get in on the action here at RAOP, but I've never had any money or mustered up the dignity to ask for a 'za on here.  Sooo...  Now that I have some cash money in the bank (not really), I am going to have a little contest of my own.  As a marketing major, one of my idols has always been BILLY MAYS. I've actually pitched a few products myself and let me tell you I am far from Mr. Mays, but I digress...  I'm not asking anyone to pitch a product like BILLY MAYS (although that would be awesome), I'm just asking you to post 2 things:  * A picture of yourself if you think you look like my idol BILLY MAYS * A note card of some sort with the date and your username to prove it's you  It's that simple.  My roommate and I will judge the quality and authenticity of your submissions. Hopefully we will have a Domino's Pizza out by tonight!  Good luck!  *Edit (8:33pm EST): We're going to give this contest another hour or two and then we are heading to the bars. Last minute entries are welcome!  **Edit 2 (9:46pm EST): CONTEST CLOSED. My roommate and I (along with others now) are going over and voting on your submissions! We are seriously impressed with everyone's entry!  ***Edit 3 (10:01pm EST): Congratulations to [smeenatchu](http://www.reddit.com/user/smeenatchu)! Better late than never on the entry! We came to the conclusion that since you would sell an 8 year old for only 1 easy payment of $19.95, you could probably use a pizza! For those who didn't win, thanks for participating. Your consolation prize is a video of [Stop Motion Pizza Eating](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lim0iDMo9S0) dedicated to Billy Mays!	True

Favorite Picture, video, or pretty much feel good thing! 2. A short or long essay abut what the day means to you today. (if it means nothing, that works too, just thought it was fitting for the day.) Maybe include something like where you were or what you were doing on this day 10 years ago.  3. Take a picture with your name and mine, and draw your favorite animal on it. ^_^ 4. A love story! Something to make me say awwwww! (although I cheated down below, id like something different here then 1.) 5. Favorite song with a link. ^_^  ------  1. Favorite flash: [There she is!](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/161181) - its actually a full series. love it! 2. This day is a day of remembrance to me in the sense that when this happened 10 years ago, I didn't know what it meant. It wasn't till a few years ago that it truly set in. I was in middle school doing Radio and morning announcements when I found out. I remember many of my fellow classmates being taken from classses and being taken home. People were freaking out and rumors started.. I am in a town where FEMA has a building, and people were saying that the president had landed on a main highway here and was being rushed into the building. I think a few years ago it truly set in the enormity of what had happened when I finally sat down and listened to a few of the speeches and watched the videos from years ago. 3. My contest, im skipping this one =P 4. go back up to 1! 5. [Without you - Keith Urban](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3TWpWf798s&ob=av2e)   Rules on the right apply, Verification is required.

Edit: Account must be more then a month old!   EDIT2: Congrats to Alexi_Strife for winning this one today. Thanks to EVERYONE who participated. I will try to do another one next week so keep eyes posted. I really wish I could of given out more then one pizza as so many of these are wonderful! 	True
t3_kc35y	1315754254.0	tromboneham	FAP	[Offer] Papa Johns - Guess my favorite Steelers player!	Hi folks. I've got a free pizza from Papa Johns from the papa points system, and I'd like to give it to someone here!  Since this will be coming from my Papa Johns account, I will need to know your address to get the order through. If you aren't comfortable with that, I apologize, but this is the only means I have to do this right now. I've given before and received as well (though I don't think I have icons for either) so I promise I'm not going to stalk you. You may be able to even just give me a generic address in your city if you want to do carry-out.  Rules!  * One guess per hour * Each hour, if no one has guessed it, I'll add a hint. You can then guess again. * Player is currently on the team. * You don't have to be a Steelers fan. Hell, you can even be a Ravens fan and I'll give you the pizza if you win. Just grudgingly so.  I'm going to go try and find an antenna for my TV so I can hopefully watch the game later. I'll be back to look through the guesses in the order they come in.  Good luck!  Hint one: in the nfl shorter than big ben  Hint two: Not really necessary, there's very few options left after all that's been guessed, but, he's a defensive player.

Long ago, I remember the days of not having any money or food. I remember once upon a time, not having enough change in my account for a cup-of-noodles once, and digging under the soda machines outside the gas station for dropped nickles or dimes to pay for it.

I'm a 20 year old male living pretty much on his own, supporting himself at $8.00 an hour. I know what eating only ramen means.

t3_kam7x	1315612294.0	CatalystParadox	FAP	[OFFER] 2 Medium 2-topping Pizza (sorry, Dominoes only) to... someone who gives me a reason I like.	I just discovered RAOP this past week, and amidst what has otherwise been a rather shitty week, this good-hearted exchange of pizza has inspired me.  And here I am today, thinking how nice a pizza would be...  But then I see all the requests on this page.  Wasn't it the altruism, not the pizza, that inspired me in the first place?  Better to give, I say.  I don't know what my criteria are.  Let me know why I should give you pizza, whether its sad, weird, awesome, hilarious, or just plain random.    The give will be this deal from dominoes: http://www.dominos.com/pages/track.jsp?promocode=HME599 - I'd like to say "whatever place within reason" and do two or three seperate gives, but, I'm actually pretty broke right now.  Looking forward to giving more freely in the future.  P.S. - Be able to tip your driver as I cannot through the ordering system.  Edit - a few responses in, I've figured out my criteria: - Make me feel like you need/deserve pizza more than I do (I decided to spend the few bucks I have giving instead of getting for myself) - The post that makes me feel best about giving you pizza wins.  So I guess in a way it's selfish after all :P  UPDATE - Pizza sent to KimBERLY71 and her daughter.  Hooray for that!  Dominoes deal did not work, apparently, and I was charged twice what was advertised... not hooray for that part.  Consider this a recommendation against using dominoes, if possible.  D'aww.... I am meltier than the cheese - http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/K_A_M/IMAG0150.jpg?t=1315622890 	True

t3_k9mai	1315538265.0	fanimold19	pizza	[offer] Wanting to buy some pizza for someone who is having a rough time	I work at a pizza place in Columbus Oh, and one of the perks of my job is being able to occasionally bring home a pizza.  So I made my roommates a pep, bacon, mush, only to have them balls deep in WoW without even coming out to have a slice. So I'm feeling pretty down and have a pizza here, and would love to buy a pizza for someone who will actually appreciate it.  	
t3_k90ov	1315502748.0	MonkeyHouse	pizza-gold	[Offer] feeding a starving artist - or two.	Here's the deal. My boyfriend's birthday is October 4th and I would like to produce for him a piece of artwork. He knows I participate in redditgifts and RAOP so I think he would really appreciate an internet created, personal gift.  I want something physically sent to me in the mail. Since I know this is a lot to ask, I'm willing to offer two pizzas AND a care package in exchange for the art. I have no requirements for what the artwork medium is (painting, drawing, computer designed, etc.) So long as you put a little thought into it.   If you're interested in my offer, leave a comment or pm me. I can provide more information/pictures if requested. I'm at work presently and have limited access to reddit, but I will be able to respond to queries after 5pm eastern.   TL;DR if you appear legit and have artistic talent, I will send you a pizza today and a pizza when I receive artwork from you and a care package of awesomeness.    EDIT 1: Okay, so, finally home! For those wondering: my boyfriend enjoys cars, music (anything from Opeth to Joanna Newsom - no pop or country though) video games, history/science. We have been playing Little Big Planet together recently and previously played a lot of Portal 2. This is a picture of us at the [beach](http://i.imgur.com/fiYMq.jpg). I will give 3 people gift cards to dominos pizza in the next few hours. To those 3 people: if you actually complete my request of artwork, mail it to me, and I receive it by October 4th I will not only send you another dominos gift card but I will put together an awesome care package for you! Inside the care package I will include snacks (you may request favorites, no promises) possibly gift cards (grocery store, maybe pizza!) some crafts I have made and various other things I think may brighten your day. I probably will decorate the crap out of it to, it's what I do. Thank you in advance :0)   EDIT 2: I have sent out 2 pizza gift cards so far. Will be giving away at least one more.   EDIT 3: Have sent out 3 now, possibly still going to give away more. But, for the moment I'm taking a computer break so I will be back in a little while. 	True
t3_k85fs	1315437612.0	IrritableOwlSyndrome	pizza-gold	[OFFER] Lonely $15 pizza gift card wants to find a home. Who wants to help?	I tried to hook up a fellow active redditor in his request thread but someone beat me to the punch. So now I have $15 that I've already mentally committed to giving away. Who wants it?  Note: I wanted to help out this person because he is extremely active on reddit and has a buttload of karma points. So here's the deal. Meet the following criteria and your name will be tossed into the virtual hat:  - Have more than 1000 karma points - Have an account that is 4 months or older - Be active in a wide variety of subreddits - Promise to pay it forward on RAOP at some point - Not have enough funds to buy your own pizza tonight  I hope to find someone by 5:00 pm Pacific time.  :)  edit: Apparently I am supposed to include my location in my post. **SoCal.** There. But I will send the gift card anywhere where Dominos, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns can deliver to.  **FINAL EDIT: AtheistAgnostic has been pizza'd.**	True

t3_k7af8	1315374265.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] For anyone who's not feeling well or has temporarily broken themselves	**Caveat:** I want to see whether I can order pizza from Australia to the US. Found out today that I can send it to Canada, which is awesome, but now I want to try my luck in the States. If it turns out that I can't send pizza to the US, clearly I won't be sending pizza :P  That said, I'd like to make someone feel better if I can :) Post a pic or something with RAoP/date/jesses_girl on it. If a picture's not an option, I'm sure something else can be worked out. I'll also scroll through your history because I'm curious like that.  Pizza will most likely be Domino's, which is what worked going to Canada. I'll leave this up for 24 hours or so because I think this is a weird time in the US atm.  **Edit:** I picked cryemoxkidcry for a pizza, because if getting thrown through a windshield doesn't merit a pizza, I don't know what does! But I'll still leave the post active for another 7 hours like I originally said I would and if a story compels me to buy pizza, then I will :)	True
t3_k6wyx	1315349566.0	Stregano	pizza	[offer] Random Acts for Random Pizza	Now, some of this text I will tell you, it is just how I am, so please do not judge me.  I am doing well in life right now. I am not rich, but I am far from poor.  I want to give somebody a random pizza. In true fashion of a place called random acts of pizza, this will be random. How random? Well, kinda random.  I am more than happy giving a person in need some help, but I can tell you this, I am not planning on giving a person in need a pizza. If you are looking for that, hit up one of the other threads about that, as I am not about that.  Do something cool. Write a short story. Write a cool song. Draw a picture. Paint a painting. Obviously, if you do something with physical stuff like record a gymnastics performance from when you were 12 and you were amazing, I am not expecting a hard copy of that tape, or if you paint a painting, I am not asking for your painting, but maybe an image of it thrown up on imgur or something. Hell, maybe a cool wallpaper in photoshop. Maybe do some parkour in your backyard. Maybe make a video showing me your awesome gasoline rc car running. Whatever your skill is in life or whatever you enjoy in life, use it and show us a random act (please, lets keep it legal though folks).  I don't care what it is, but make it random. It can be about pizza if you want, but I could care less if it is not. Now, I started coming here because I enjoy the after images of people who get pizzas. I love those images. The people are just so damn happy, and now I want to do that for somebody.  So r/raop, let's get random. I will be honest, there is a 90-95% chance that it will just be an online gift certificate or something since I do not really check reddit from home (plus, it gives everybody time). This is not a do something cool and get pizza tonight, as that would not be fair to everybody. I am thinking sometime tomorrow, or Thursday, or possibly even Friday (Friday pizza on me, that might not be a bad idea). Keep it awesome and keep it random. Remember, this is not a talent show, it is you being random. Maybe one of you draws a picture and you drew your damn heart out, but that image sucks ass, well, this is random, so it might get picked.  I have never given on this site, but that is changing now. Take your time. Do not rush what you want to do. If anybody wants an extension if they are working on something, chances are I will extend it.  Remember, this is not a talent contest, but I will say that I will lean towards people either posting something about what they enjoy or are good at. So if you just reply with a curse word, sure it is random and you have a chance, but hell, even if you think your job is boring, throw something up on wordpress and talk about it and let us be the judge. Maybe you are a collector (like me personally, I am a video game collector and with enough digging, or you asking nicely, I am willing to show images of it).  So, a pizza on me. Sob stories will not get pizzas (unless, that is, you are really good at telling short stories, but please say something if you are). There are plenty of others out there to give those people pizza, and that is not me.  tl;dr - keep it random, keep it legal, I will lean closer to people who post their talents (just words in the post, an image, youtube video, blog post, etc) even though this is not a talent show, sob stories will not get pizzas here (sorry, but that is how I roll, there are plenty of other threads for that)  EDIT: upvotes will help. Since that means that a bunch of people like whatever it is that you post. Also, if you post something up anywhere, just provide some type of proof it is you. I will not be that picky, but this is the 1st time I have offered anything, and if somebody posts up something awesome they just Googled for, then honestly, I probably won't be nice and give people pizza anymore. Just sayin, please show some way, even if small, to prove it is you  EDIT 2: The purpose of me doing this is to prove a point to not just me, but to yourselves. A good point, and that is that some people do not care how much money you have. We all have something about us that makes us unique. Flaunt it and be yourself, and who knows, maybe someday, like in the next couple days, some random dude on the internet will want to see it and buy you a pizza for it. We are all unique individuals, so I am looking for something that you personally do. Don't show me something your kid does or your parent or your uncle. I want you. Yes, the person reading this, I want to see a small glimpse of you, not somebody else. Don't think that you can't impress me. It is not about that. Your talent in my opinion may suck ass, but if it is your talent, I will hold it in high regard.  EDIT 3: I have not given any pizza out yet. I am still letting this ride out. I personally am unsure when I will pick the random people, but it will more than likely be tomorrow or Friday, so please do not feel like you would be left out from posting something random and fun.  EDIT 4: I have decided to give multiple people pizza money. It could be 5 people, it could be 2. It will be a minimum of 2 (probably 2, but maybe 3 depending on how cheap I can get a mattress for my bed since my current one blows).  FINAL EDIT BEFORE PIES ARE GIVEN OUT: I work until about 5pm Pacific Time, and am going to come home and will get the names, so stay tuned. I will announce the lucky people who gets pies from me here at about 6pm Pacific time. That is the earliest today that I can do it. It will happen, I promise. It may not be exactly 6pm Pacific time. It may be 5:45 or 6:15, but around there  2 People who get Pies: hyuugurt, garseed  congrats you guys.  send me a PM with your e-mail address and the pizza place of your choice where I can send you some type of giftcard to.  If you do not respond within 24 hours (I have been contacted by one of the people already) then it will go to another random person.  If you did not get it from me, do not feel bad.  I will do this again sometime hopefully soon.  The random stuff people posted was awesome and put a smile on my face and everybody else's face.  So please do not think you lost a contest, as I just plugged the names into a random generator I made and these 2 came up the most after 10 runs of the program.  Keep it awesome, and keep it fancy you guys.  Thanks for giving me a great week with the awesome random stuff and thanks for sharing.  I enjoyed every single post on here, and I am sure that everybody else did as well.	True

t3_k5pte	1315257983.0	badbrownie	brownie	[Offer] For the needy working single parent, or needy college kid or needy anybody!	[EDIT: Contest Closed.  We have 5 winners: JKenney1 (please contact me to claim!), cassiewilber, Phosoup, and IwillPayYouBack and 12223Go.  Other than that, I'm pizza'd out!]  Prove it to me and I'll give you a pizza coupon.  But here's your challenge.  Whatever evidence you offer I'm gonna ask myself "Does this prove it or is it easy to fake".  If it's easy to fake or is not evidence of hardship then No Pizza For You.  This is a tough contest and it's my first attempt at this kind of thing.  I'm hoping that you guys who are struggling know how to demonstrate it better than I, who am not.  If this contest works then I'll make it a regular thing.  I'm happy to help the needy but have allergic reactions to scammers so it makes it hard.    Some thoughts:  * Photos help but they should be personalized so I know they're from you.  the photo including a piece of paper with BB written on it would suffice.  **I'll probably ignore photos that aren't personalized as I'll think "Too Easy To Fake"** * Evidence of collection agencies chasing you would probably help to convince you were struggling * paychecks (with personalized parts blanked out) and BB written on them would be convincing. * pic of you with the kids would demonstrate need also  Please don't post any pics that give away personal info.  Redact that out.  Cover it with something or color it black.  Up to you, but please don't show names, addresses and SSNs on anything you post.  I dunno.  I just want to help the needy and I **know** that RAOP is a great way for some people to see if they can scam people cos, to paraphrase the batman quote, some people just like to see the world buy them a pizza.

t3_k4jaj	1315160167.0	tokenfemale	pizza	[OFFER] $20 Dominos Pizza Card US	A week or so ago, I had a little kerfuffle in getting pizza for someone in Canada - I eventually got him his pizza, but ended up with an extra dominos card in the process.

There are tons of people here who respond to those...I am not one of them.   I'll pick the best (in my opinion, this isn't objective by any means) random reason in 4 hours, that way I don't automatically respond to the first funny answer that comes in, which I'm prone to do. :)  Edit: You're all awesome - I'm going to take a bunch that I think are "best," assign numbers, and run through a random number generator.

t3_k1w2p	1314922497.0	hyloda	PIF	[Offer] I want to offer a pizza to a socially inept pseudo or real asshole.	Are you an asshole? I'm an asshole. I'm not socially inept, though. I know the effects of my assholery. My husband, however, has an Aspie dad. As a result he, while not on the Autism Spectrum, has many bizarre qualities. I love them. Many people are intimidated by him. A lot of people love him, too, though. He gets a lot of respect, even though he says asshole-y things. I think it is because he's only a pseudo-asshole. He says things, yet they are true and insightful. I guess people sense he's not trying to be an asshole even if he's saying asshole-y things (sharp contrast to me who says asshole-y things so that people feel the sting of my asshole-y-ness)? I don't get respect for saying asshole-y things (probably because I'm a woman). Just him. I think it is because he has this massively sexy browridge. Seriously. It is so seriously Neanderthal status. He also has bad eyesight and has to squint. One time, this guy straight up asked my hubby why he was looking at him like he wanted to kill him. He was only squinting.   So I've already ordered 4 pizzas for 2 different redditors (one is a random student, the other one is a redditor who already recently got a pizza). I'm in the process of giving two more away (to two teen mom lovers). All these pizzas are in honor of Glinda_Da_Good_Witch. She gave me a pizza a few days ago. Really lifted up my spirits. While I'm not sure she appreciates the way I'm giving this out, I hope *you* do. I bet I made you laugh, which, in turn, caused endorphins to be released. Endorphins are also released during orgasm. So...it is like I sort of gave you an orgasm. You should pay for that.   But instead, here I am, offering a pizza to an asshole.   P.S. You have to prove that you're an asshole. I don't like stupid assholes, either. I like intelligent ones--the ones that are armed with superb grammar and punctuation skills. Extra points if I look through your history and you troll a lot. But it has to be funny trolling. Sorry, stupies.

If you have shown compassion to a teen mom, post a comment. Don't PM. I'll PM you if I want to offer you a pizza.  P.S. I am/was a teen mom. No one could ever tell, though, and I made friends with highly educated women in their late-20s to mid-30s. Some people have even asked me if I had my PhD (which is common in the circles I'm a part of). I've always hated people who showed a lack of compassion for young mothers.  **Pizza given to shhhXdontXtell**  **Noticed 11 downvotes. 11 unhappy, asswipes hate teen moms which make Jesus and Richard Dawkins cry.**	True
t3_k1qwq	1314912801.0	hyloda	PIF	[Offer] Free pizza to someone who has already gotten one this week.	I'd like to offer pizza to someone who has already received one this week. Some jackasses here think that receiving pizza is something that should be done sporadically; that if you are receiving what they perceive to be "too many", that you're just some crazy, greedy basketcase. I beg to differ.  I can only order from Domino's or Papa John's, though, so make sure one is near you. You can decide to go pick it up yourself or have it delivered. I would like to use the verification system. If you don't know how to use it, you should probably figure it out.  Don't PM me first. I'm going to be posting a few offers, so I'd prefer if you'd comment here. If I want to give you pizza, I will PM you.  **Edited to add: Pizza was given to "menmybabies".**	True

t3_k15ls	1314870672.0	jesses_girl	jessesgirl	[Offer] for an Australian redditor in exchange for eyecandy	I've worked 12 hour days all week (and I'm still in the office) and I forgot to pay rent/credit card today. Oops.   I'll buy you pizza if you provide me with eyecandy in the form of Michael Fassbender, aka Erik/Magneto in the X-Men First Class movie :) Wallpaper, icons, a REALLY AWESOME picspam, etc. It's got to be awesome eyecandy though. No payout for half-assed untalented efforts. Sorry. This post isn't for helping people at all, it's just a way to brighten up the next few hours at work :)  If you think you can write me an X-Men fic, PM me and I'll send you a prompt and we can talk. If it's an awesome fic, I will send you a pizza feast that will leave you unable to move :P  I know the chances are slim, but hey :) They pay me to sit here late into the night so I might as well put the money to good use.  (International would be candy-spammers and ficcers - you can give it a go if you like and if your work is awesome I will try and get pizza to you somehow but you do it on the risk that pizza might not be able to swim.)

t3_k0rwz	1314837037.0	lessfrictionless		[Offer] Pizza to a person or family in need. No hoops to jump through. Just big cheese discs to receive.	I don't want you to paint a picture, write a story, send images of the moment of delivery, or even submit a post of thanks. I am not in the habit of making people in relative need dance for my amusement just so I'll toss a coin in their general direction. I just want to see someone helped through the direct transfer of food (not cash). I have given in other ways as well, to food-based charities with whom monetary donations enjoy low attrition. This subreddit, however, seems satisfyingly more immediate. I'm a bio-chem major with a 3.86 GPA at a major U.S. university and my grant this semester was slightly larger than what I need to sustain myself. So here we are.   Let me know your deal and I'll see if I can hook it up.  EDIT: Alright, I don't know how horrible this is going to sound, but I've been reading the requests through and I haven't come across one from a redditor with a well-established history, either in their user activity, length of membership in general, or the simple fact that they've shown high specificity to this forum. I have to request that the recipient use their main name just to reduce the BS potential. **This is not to say that the needs of a long-time lurker or recent registrant are less valuable--just harder to verify. If you wish to attempt to do so, be my guest.**  I want to make sure that someone would really be helped here. I'm sorry for the difficulty this may cause.	True

So I am buying a pizza tomorrow for someone who can write me the best story about a frog and draw a frog. Yeah I know it sounds strange, but I love frogs. I am not saying that the drawing has to be magnificent, but it has to look like a frog. And the story has to be about a frog and it has to be pg.  NO BAD WORDS OR NAUGHTY FROGS! I want it clean. I will pick the winner at 4 pm my time tomorrow (in Kansas) and I will pm the winner and get information from them to get you a pizza. And if anyone says anything about me not buying groceries or getting my gas on, well, I don't have enough to turn it on and I have a few groceries to get me and my daughter by and I know that I will be blessed by doing this. So please don't say anything to me. Okay, ready, set, story and drawing time. Good luck. OH and I will also look at votes for help in picking my winner.

t3_jyt6g	1314685400.0	luckytopher	pizza	[offer] A pizza, for you, but no sob stories please!	I was lucky enough to be gifted a pizza a few weeks back.  I could afford it, but I was upset due to a pending divorce and it was nice to have someone give a shit, someone that didn't even know me.  Reinforced my views on things.  So I promised I'd give back and now I'm going to.    My rules, because, hey, it's my pizza to give away, right?  * Leave a comment in this thread (duh) *  Tell me something interesting.  It can be a random fact.  It can be something neat you've done with your life.  Anything.  Anything EXCEPT a sob story.  I already gave mine and that's more than enough for the both of us, buddy. * Tell me what kind of pizza you like. * Tell me what kind of soda you like (particularly the kind that pizza guys deliver hint hint nudge nudge) * Please post a picture receiving/enjoying/munching.

t3_jyitj	1314664707.0	tromboneham	FAP	[Offer] US, Contest! Drawing poorly for pizza.	I posted this really really late last night, and I don,'t think many people saw it. So far only three entrants. As I didn't actually get the check I was hoping for, I have to extend this another day anyway, so I'm going to repost.  Copy/paste: I was lucky (or stupid enough) to win a contest a week or so ago, and now I'm expecting a rather large check today, so I can finally return the favor.  &nbsp;   Prefacing this contest with this: I have no real artistic skills beyond playing my instrument. I can't draw anything decent to save my life. As such, I'm requesting you make some sort of art, and trust me, it can be god-awful. I like to laugh, I'm a fan stick figures. Rage comics are boring, don't do that.  &nbsp;  Only rules: Needs to relate to two photos, and have either my username or yours with the submission.   &nbsp;  First photo: [Myself, in China, doing what I do for a living.](http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/s720x720/189442_747909007567_37606829_38879036_447129_n.jpg)  Second photo: [My kick-ass dog.](http://i.imgur.com/tFcPV.jpg)  &nbsp;  In theory, this will be for Monday evening, after I get back from classes (7 pm est). There's a chance the direct deposit on my check won't go through until Tuesday, so the ending time is a bit open-ended.  &nbsp;  With that said, make me laugh. I'm going to bed now, but I will see every submission. The amount of upvotes you get really has no bearing other than other people liking it, so please, if you see your fellow-contest-entrants with something funny, upvote it. I'm going to post the three that already posted. If I still don't get my check tomorrow, I got a small refund from my previous cable supplier today, I'll just use that.  Not at all ending this, but I'm definitely buying a pizza for prances_with_pantses, because I am for sure making that my phone's background. Keep submitting, I'll pick another (or two more) tomorrow  **Last Edit, for Now: Unfortunately I won't be able to help out more people today. When I do get my check (the department of Ed is so damn slow) I'll be contacting some people through PM's if they're still in need. Thank you everyone for the submissions, I laughed at every one of them, promise. Hopefully it'll be sooner I can hook some of you up rather than later. Until then, I wish you good luck in your pizza hunting.**	True

I ask people vote on the ones they feel deserve it most and i'll want some sort of a verification.  Show me a negative bank balance, a 2 month past due electricity bill, something to show you're having a difficult time.  If you're in school show me that you just bought tuition and books for like thousands of bucks.  I ask that you not make them into novella's as I can't read all that.  You don't have to post proof unless I ask for it in PM.  Again i'll be using verification and oh, if you've given pizza and have the icon i'll be giving you extra consideration.  Basically i'm going to pick the top 10 people i feel need it the most.  Others can comment with votes on why they think the person needs it the most as well.  I will check back tomorrow (monday) at approximately 11am to noon EST to sift through the people and pick the lucky 10.  All that I ask in return is that you let the mods know i sent and you post pictures of the pretty pizzas (and what you got on them, i am always curious).  Thanks for reading, good luck and post you stories.  	True

Reposted the contest with the same rules figuring this post is going to fade by tomorrow.]  This is a family offer for you lazy good-for-nothing teenagers who spend all your time on reddit instead of cleaning your damn room!  I want to shock and confuse your parents by suddenly buying dinner for the whole family!  I want you to take a pic with the old folks with you holding a drawing of a pizza with "BB" written on it.  The first winner gets a budget of up to $50 to spend on pizza.  It's $10/person in the pic.  So if it's just you and your single mom then it's $20.  But if it's you and and your sister and your mom and dad then it's $40.  Nothing for anyone under the age of 7 though.  They don't eat enough to warrant a portion.  They'll have to scrounge off the rest of you like the helpless babes they are.  But I'll accept grannies and grandpas if they're over and visiting.  Other conditions may apply:  * You must have >500 karma on reddit.  That's where you spend all your time after all. * The teenager must be the owner of the reddit account.  No calling your teenage kids into the room, reddit parents, sorry. * I'm ordering the pizzas to your house so you must be willing to PM your address/phone/firstName as well as detailed details about the pizzas you want if you win.   * You must be willing to eat the pizza today or tomorrow.

The judge's decision will be final (and in the case of a tie, possibly random), etc etc.   PS. The 500 karma point condition *may* be flexible if you seem extra likeable, but not **that** flexible  PPS. Previous pizza winners ARE eligible for this pizza.   	True

In your comment, write what toppings you want, or you can write "surprise me" and I'll decide for you if you're selected.

I'll let the winner come forward if they choose.  BTW, I'm a sneaky bastard as I hope you will soon find out.  Love and full stomachs to all! Tres**   ~~~~   ~~(Mods, if this is in violation of the rules please delete and let me know what part was in violation so that I can try again :)  )  I have a fantastic life and am very happy.  Happiness was increased today when I was told I am getting a little bonus for doing such a good job at work.  I want to share with RAoP and make someone's day!  I also want to spread joy and happiness through out a beautiful subreddit that has had a recent rough patch.  I will come back here between no later than 9pm eastern and select the winner of the delicious pie.  If you won't be home during those hours, don't worry!  If you win we can chat and determine a time that works best for you.  Rules (my money, my rules, right?).  1) You must use the verification system.   2) I will send myself an eCard and send the pizza with that.  3) Will only send to residential addresses.  4) I will be the sole judge of this contest.  I am in WV (USA) but will not show regional preference.  I'm not positive that the ecards work between countries.   To win:  Entertain me and the rest of the subreddit.  Write a song or song parody, write a story, post a picture, tell a joke, make a youtube, do whatever you want and whatever makes you happy.    To help you judge what might entertain me:  I'm a 45 yo lesbian, love dogs, love cats, love fart jokes, think rage comics can be hysterical, adore just about anything "inappropriate for polite company (except for violent/gross pictures)."  I also like things that make you go "awww."  I was going to require that the winner agree to post a picture of the pizza, but I don't want to rule out folks who don't have cameras.  A picture of the pizza would be awesome, though.  If you use a computer at a library, please don't hesitate to enter.  You don't have to receive the pizza tomorrow (later today), you just have to enter by then.  If you can only check in once every few days and you are the winner, you will have an inbox message from me the next time you stop by.  Love, cheese, and sauce to all!~~~~~~	True

But, I was just given a small cash reward for something that didn't deserve a reward, nor would they listen to me refusing it. So I'll pay it forward.  If you're *genuinely* hungry this evening, and you want a pizza, I'd love to buy you one. Please don't take advantage of getting to this post the fastest - honestly consider whether you really need one.  I'm UK based - but if I can get one via an international website (i.e. US), then I'll do that instead.  Edit: I've had a few messages, but they're nearly all from brand new accounts. Is this the norm round here? I've only got one pizza to give away, and scared I'm getting done. Am I wrongly cynical?  Edit2: I've ordered a disposable VISA card. It looks to be the only way I can order internationally, and I can help several people instead of one here in the UK. I'll repost as soon as it arrives. If anyone, in the meantime, can find a way I can order food (not just pizza!) to someone in the USA with paypal or similar, please send me a message   Edit3: Might have managed to get a Domino's e-card thing, waiting for confirmation  Edit4: Success - I have a Domino's eGift Card. I'm probably going to hell for this, but unfortunately cannot consider anyone with a brand new (zero day) account  Edit5: This has now been given to someone in need. I'll do what I can to help again next week, apologies it's not more often.	True

I contacted the requestee, got an email address and hopped off to get an e-gift card...to find I can't pay.  All the schemes I could find require a US address for payment and we're in the UK.    I'm now feeling really bad that the family I wanted to help may now be disappointed.  If there's anyone in the US who would like to facilitate some pizza donating I will happily paypal/western union/bank transfer money if you can donate or "swap" a gift with someone of your choice or dispatch an amazon gift voucher of the amount.  I realise this is not entirely what this subreddit was meant for but I would like to do my very best to get a family that is feeling a bit clouded over some pizza.    Please contact me if you have offers/ideas.  Thanks in advance

t3_iioa5	1310007067.0	mikkjel	pizza	[Offer]Pizza for clever person or clever person's person	I recently found random acts of pizza after I mistook it for "random facts of pizza" on [this poster](http://i.imgur.com/rS8hw.png). The problem is that I am 1) Norwegian (so dont live close to most redditors) and 2) on holiday in Canada without the authenticator required to pay with my visa card. I am therefore posing a challenge:  If you need a pizza and can find a clever way to pay for it with PayPal, I'll buy you a pizza.  If you don't need a pizza and can find a clever way to pay for it with PayPal, I'll buy a pizza for a person of your choice. PM me with pizza details of post in the thread. If you don't, I'll chose a suitable candidate.  Lastly, it would be nice to get some links together on the sidebar to help people pay with paypal, which makes it a lot easier for us european redditors to help with pizzas overseas.  EDIT: challenge update:   1) To qualify, I must be able to pay for the pizza with only a paypal account and a computer with an internet connection, and the receiving redditor doesn't have to do anything but pick up or receive the pizza.  2) It can use an intermediary site, but the site must not take a high transaction fee (whether or not it is reasonable will be determined by me).  3) For each month the challenge goes unsolved, another pizza will be added to the prize. If someone actively does something to make it possible (start a chain of pizzerias that accepts paypal, makes a pizzapaymentplan for paypal online OSTTE) they will receive double pizzas.  As of posting the challenge, Domino's pizza Israel and UK are paypal friendly.	True

t3_i4xo9	1308627478.0	datsik		[Offer] I can get you FREE $20 Papa Johns Gift Card	I released a how to get free pizza guide on this forum that I frequent and I ran into this subreddit so I thought I could help. Now this may be unethical to most, but it gets the job done. This will take about 2 minutes of your time and requires absolutely no purchase from you or me. A mod can do this to "verify" this method if he/she would like.   This will require Teamviewer so that I may do the method for less confusion/speed.  tl;dr I can get free $20 Papa John's Gift Cards but I need to connect to your computer because i've already done this on my IP.  The steps:   http://www.trialpay.com/campaign/?c=e6e0c92&cat=-1&tid=A7DeNX2      Find the Rogaine offer. It should be on the first page.      Sign up and use fake info if you want. Use an empty VirtualCreditCard. IF you need one PM Me. Once you enter in your VCC info, you should land on a order confirmed page. Stay there and leave it there. If you need one search here on TBN      Go back to trial pay and hit check my status.      It should've credited instantly and there you go your free $20 GC to Papa Johns.  Enjoy your free pizza!! Please post back on the post if it worked for you or not :). 	True

In this thread preferred but a PM will work just as well if you'd rather stay anonymous (But I hope you'll understand if I send your username to a mod, I think they like to keep track on who receives a pizza.)  I can't give out much as I'm still in a bind, but it would clear my conscious knowing that I've finally payed it forward.  EDIT: Sorry guys! Something came up but I should be back in an hourish. Please PM or put a message here anyway so I'll be able to send a Pizza ASAP when I'm back.  **EDIT: Going off to deliver a pizza.

t3_hueob	1307512842.0	anassakata	pizza	[OFFER] College student with a summer job--help me put my paycheck to good use.	I'm based in Portland, OR, but I don't mind venturing further afield.  I don't need the money I've been earning, and so many people in need are looking for jobs. Please help me feel like I'm doing something to benefit others. Nobody should have to live on bread or rice for a week while waiting for their next paycheck. If this remotely sounds like you, let me know.	
t3_hudet	1307508998.0	azzip_oAR	pizza	[Offer] Grad Student, poor-ish but I'd like to buy someone a pizza, maybe a couple/husband-wife/parents of young kids.	Basically, I'm a nerdy american engineering grad student, doing research, trying to change the world, etc. I'm making a bit of money but my parents are doing well enough now that they help cover some of my rent/food.   The reason I'd like to buy someone a pizza and why I have a preference about who it goes to (not that I mean to judge about who is "deserving") is that I'd like to help someone do what my parents do for me. I've tried to pay them back for things but they just insist I use it to treat myself to things, to enjoy school. So instead, I'd like to spend a bit of my paycheck on someone else's parents.   That failing, I'd be really happy to give it to a young couple who is struggling maybe. Here I have to admit that I have a bit of a different motive. The other reason I have a bit of money to spend on someone else's food is that I had some plans for it. I had been saving a bit of cash to do something nice for a certain someone but she's gone now so I figure, buying dinner for another young couple...to the universe at least, it's all the same no?   And yes, I did create a reddit account just for this purpose. I've never had one before, always just lurked (yes I'm a bit anti-social even on the internet), but this seemed as good a reason as I'll get to make one.   Ninja edit: I realize it's probably a bit late for ordering pizza for a lot of people but maybe if you'd like one for tomorrow we can arrange that? I'll be going to sleep by 11:30pm Pacific Time because I have to be up super early so working out something for tomorrow makes a lot of sense anyway since I have no idea how quickly people will respond to this.  Morning edit: apologies to everyone for not responding last night. I got called back into the lab and fell asleep at my desk. The offer stands! Thanks to anarchocap for following up on fuzzyslippers33 while I was asleep!	True
t3_hu9kx	1307499008.0	SaintNicholas_		[Offer] Pizza for someone with hungry kids	I have a young child, and I can't imagine having them be hungry.  I'd like to email a gift card to someone that is having a tough time keeping kids fed.  Only 1 to give away right now unfortunately.	
t3_hu77f	1307493043.0	sabin357		[OFFER] Not rich, but want to help someone in need. USA	I just won my company's "Biggest Loser" contest and the cash prize that went with it. Most of it is going towards my bills, but I want to help someone while I can. Please tell me why you need help as I can only spare enough to help one family, so I want it to be someone who needs it.  EDIT: I have found 2 people that really need a hand up. Sorry to say that's all I can do for tonight.	True
t3_hu2vl	1307482539.0	alienzx	pizza	[OFFER] Pizza/food to those who are in real need and hungry. I will give as much as I can afford.	Due to religious restrictions, I cannot purchase meat or meat products. I will only be able to offer delicious veggie goodness or awesome cheesy pies!  (preferably US/Canada users, but can figure out a way to help you elsewhere too)  EDIT: Hey guys, I am all tapped out for now. Please PM me if you are really desperate and missed out.

t3_htnn8	1307446163.0	awh		[OFFER] Pizza in Japan	I'm not super-rich or anything, but most of the time I can come up with the money for a pizza.

t3_htmsg	1307442887.0	noisymime		[OFFER] - A couple of pizzas going here, preferably in Aus.	OK, this will sound completely silly, especially considering this is actually my first post, but I figure if I'm giving away pizzas i should at least get to tell a story.   Last Friday, ignoring all my best instincts, I 'bought' and paid for PS3 on eBay using a bank transfer. Sure enough it was a scam and now I'm likely out $300, at least for the foreseeable future as the bank says I shouldn't hold my breath. Strangely, instead of being pissed off, this has actually made me realise how lucky I am that I'm in a position where this loss doesn't really affect me in a substantial way. I figure I should spread the love a bit for someone who needs some pizza.   Would prefer someone in Australia as that's where I am, but tell me a story and I'll consider anyone/anywhere as long as its not too hard.

t3_htgwx	1307421235.0	ginandtunic	FAP	[OFFER] - A pizza to the first person that has a genuine need for a hot meal.	One of my favorite things to do is help people less fortunate than I am.  I had a very poor upbringing but made the best with what I was handed in life and make a good living now.  I was helped out by very generous people growing up (people who donate time/money/clothes/gifts, etc to foster care are the best people on the planet, IMHO) so now I want to give back as much as possible.  EDIT: Due to the overwhelming response to this the offer stands for more than just "the first person". I've already sent one gift card to Dominos and plan on sending a few more pizzas out today. And a big thank you to anyone saying I'm awesome...I'm not awesome, just a human helping humans, hopefully this catches on and together we can feed and help people in need.   EDIT 2: 3 pizzas have been given out. More to come. Dominos thinks someone stole my card and is buying pizza for people! :) they're making me call and verify now so it may take awhile at this point. I'm in the process of moving so I'm doing this all from my phone. Also, if anyone is in the San Diego area and needs (or knows anyone that needs) any food let me know as we're getting rid of all my pantry food and I'd rather donate it than throw it away. 	True

If your story reaches out to me, I'll be more than happy to be an RAOP contributor.  EDIT: Sending Pizza to hungry students @ my alma matter.	True
t3_hiv6a	1306242477.0	Statertie	pizza	[OFFER] Pizza in the UK, eh?	This is my first post (link?) on Reddit and I just want to do something nice for someone.  I was planning on going on a pub crawl this weekend but I've decided I'd much rather spend the money (that I was inevitably about to waste on Sunday's headache) on a pizza for a special Redditor out there. It's Tuesday today so Dominos have that 2 for 1 deal on which might be a good idea but if you'd prefer something different, well that's all right too. I don't mind, it's your pizza.  I'd also prefer a UK pizza eater but if you're seriously starving and elsewhere, I'll see what I can do.  tl:dr: Want a pizza?
