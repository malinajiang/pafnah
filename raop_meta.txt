A guy using the account /u/muffinimilky (one extra i) scammed me into getting him a pizza as well. Kinda sad that people would do this when they could probably just ask for a pizza here themselves.

t3_5bcl0j	1478385142.0	daftne		[Meta] eGift card purchases for pizzahut/dominos refuse to go through...	Apologies is this is weird, but it's driving me bonkers.  My mom has been kind enough to offer me pizza from across the states (she's in PA, I'm in CA) and she has tried with multiple cards, all very much possessing enough money to purchase a pizza, only to have an email come back to her saying it was unable to be processed. I know it's not user error, she's more competent on a computer than I am lol And I've called customer service for pizzahut, at least, several times and all they can tell me is that "we're provided with no specific information as to why it won't go through, only that sometimes if a person doesn't write out the billing address in the exact same way (street instead of st if your cc has it as street) it gets rejected." Well we checked for that as well, and it's still seemingly this useless thing.  So now I'm here, the place where pizza dreams come true, asking you fine folks how the fuck you buy pizza for strangers in a world where they require the card holder to be present at the delivery location, when it seems all other options dangle the possibility of your pizza dreams being fulfilled, only to dash them with what I can only imagine are fbi background checks for cards being used for purchases?  ~  As I wrote this, I found amazon sells dominos egift cards, as does walmart, so she is trying that, but I thought I should still post this anyways, as I am genuinely curious what you folks use. I tried loading the chat but it wasn't working for me.  Wooops didn't use the right tag, sorry! Also, she managed to get the dominos card to go through via Amazon, so that's solved, but again, I'm still curious about your thoughts on the matter. :)

There's been an uptick in the number of users sending PM's using similar usernames to "collect" pizzas, or just sending PM's to ask for pizza outright.  When having a contest or an offer, I **highly suggest** not publicly announcing whom you have chosen, until you have worked with the recipient in private to gift them. Publicly announcing the winner beforehand allows someone to create a similar username, and PM the giver to try and scam their way into a free pizza.   If you receive a PM from someone trying the similar username trick, please notify the moderators-- Same thing if someone PMs you begging for a pizza. They will be banned.   Thank you!

I'm sorry if I'm not. I'm kind of trying to hurry for this guy.  A friend from the UK we play FFXIV with is depressed and hungry. He says he hasn't eaten in a couple days and there's some complication with the benefits he gets.  I don't know anything about that part, but he's never actually asked for anything.  Anyway, I just wanted to send him some pizza or groceries or...something. Preferably delivered because he's got some serious social anxiety issues.  The place he lives isn't within delivery distance of a Pizza Hut or Dominoes, apparently. And all of the independent shops' sites won't accept my credit card because of the address (also read that in the sidebar info).  I tried Tescos but I guess you need some kind of membership for there? I also think the holidays are goofing stuff up.  I'm not sure what else to try here, any suggestions? I can provide a town if that's ok and not too private. Or I can PM it to someone who thinks they could help me to help someone.  EDIT: We found someone that placed an order for us that I reimbursed via paypal for a big order of pizza and chips, etc. We're gonna figure out if we can get him some groceries or something to last until his benefits arrive.

t3_3xtzle	1450791101.0	jengomezthe3rd		[META] This sub seems to have turned into nothing but requests-- how do we get some of the givers to come back?	Just opening a thread for discussion. I originally found RAOP back in 2011 or 2012, and used to have fun giving away pizza on the regular. The community was vibrant, with a pretty even split on requests and offers. It looks like it's seen better days, as I can tell by the front page being mostly unfulfilled requests.   So let's look at ways to solve that. What would make you more likely to give here again? What can be done better? What is hindering the process, and if so, how can we mitigate that for you?   I'm not promising any changes to the current system, I just want to spark a conversation about how we can go from 20-30 people asking for pizza into a vacuum chamber, into actually being a community again.   	
t3_3xbizm	1450424536.0	Lxjones5	pizza	[meta] Got pizza'd recently but not in violation of rules?	I've seen multiple posts recently wherein the requester is being called out for having received pizza within the last week or two, or even longer ago, but is not in violation of any of the rules. For example, I've seen comments telling requesters to wait a couple of weeks after receiving a pizza before requesting again even though that's not specified in the rules. Will the rules be updated to reflect these new standards? There isn't anything that says a poster that was pizza'd 2 weeks ago and isn't breaking rules shouldn't be able to request/receive a pizza again. As a frequent giver, I always check user history, make sure the rules are being followed, and make an informed decision based upon someone's receipt history, but it's not necessarily against the rules for someone to have received pizza 3 weeks ago to be requesting/getting another. Can someone please explain this to me? Thanks!

I know that a post very similar to this has already been stickied but I got scammed out of 25 bucks today and would like to remind some people to be careful. Mods, feel free to delete this if you feel the need.  I offered to buy a redditor some pizza last night but everything was closed by the time she had got the message so we had to wait til this afternoon. After exchanging some messages, I decided to get a 25 dollar card for her (partially because you can get a free Large 1 topping pizza from Papa Johns if you purchase a 25 dollar or more card).   Hours later after sending the card I got a pm from the real redditor saying she was sorry for the late reply but that she was ready to get her pizza if that was okay with me. Confused as hell, thinking there was no possible way I just got scammed out of 25 bucks I went and checked my pm's and sure enough, a /u/abit0fhappiness had been talking to me this whole time instead of /u/abitofhappiness.   TL;DR: I was way too careless and lost 25 bucks. Be careful or there's a good possibility you can get scammed.

(I feel bad for his mom).  Here's a little trick: Go to Google.com and type in   site:reddit.com *add username*  Where *add username* is the person's username. You will see ALL of their submissions and comments, including the ones they deleted and thought were gone forever. To search on just RAoP you can even do   site:reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza *add username*  /u/desure has routinely used that username to scam people because of the rule here that you need an account over 60 days. People make multiple accounts and sit on them. Once they are old enough, the scamming begins. That rule is pretty much useless now considering that everybody has multiple accounts. That being said, use Google to your advantage. DON't BELIEVE SOB SToRIES!!  Give randomly, not because you feel bad for someone's story. They're all fake!

t3_3ditt7	1437065497.0	Dauss	shroom	[META] Keep the good vibes going, write a nice letter about your delivery guy/gal!	Earlier this week, I ordered a pizza for myself through Domino's. Now if you've ever ordered from them online, you probably know about the pizza tracker thing after you actually submit the order, a meter that will show up and tell you everything that's going on about your pizza up until the moment it leaves the store.  I noticed that a single guy was involved in the entire process of my pizza from order to door, a guy named Musa. He accepted the order, made the pizza, handled it in and out of the oven, and drove it to my door. Once he got there, he was super friendly and we had a quick chat while I paid him (with a decent tip of course) and off he went.   I realized I was smiling because he totally brightened up my day just by being a genuinely nice guy, so I took the 3 minutes out of my day to write a nice letter to Domino's corporate about how pleasant an experience it was to have Musa involved with my pizza ordering experience. The next day my phone rang, and I picked it up to have Musa ask for my name. I told him that was me and he was just incredibly happy that I'd done that little thing for him. He was speechless, saying he doesn't know how he can repay me for my kindness, that his boss was very pleased with him, and just endless amounts of praise, and all it took was me writing that little letter about what a nice guy he was.  So remember, it doesn't take a lot for you to make someone's day. Just write a nice letter if you thought your delivery person did a good job, you never know what it might mean for them and it's so little to do on your part.

You are looking to get a free pizza or give one away. None of your personal information is required to get or give one. What IS required? An email address, 30 days of activity and that's about it folks. If someone asks for your name, physical address or phone number, politely decline and inform the giver that it isn't required. If they force the issue... WALK AWAY. A $10 pizza isn't worth giving up your personal data.

t3_371z69	1432435902.0	chaintep93		[Meta] I'd like to say a few words to everyone here.	So a few days ago there was a contest held on here and at least thirty people, including myself, entered to win. One person won, and I'm happy they did but that's not what upset me.   What upset me was the fact that the contest was voted down so much! Just why? He wasn't asking for people to post a picture of themselves trying to climb a tree, or ask them to write a three page story about why they love pizza or even something as bad as to take a creep shot of a woman in a bikini top without her knowing!!  He didn't HAVE to give anyone a pizza, he did it because he was happy and wanted to return the favor when he needed a pizza. And I'm just angry he was downvoted so much. Whoever did out of spite, or you didn't like the contest or whatever, you should be ashamed.  And if your ever enter a contest, hold one, ask for a pizza or say thank you, all I ask is that you remember that every pizza given is out of genuine kindness from someone. So really, don't be an a-hole or as little as one as possible. That's all I really wanted to say.

I'm in USA, they ended up being in Canada. Firstly, when I placed the order via PapaJohns app, it never asked me for my card info...I was surprised. Ended up calling the location where the employee told me they can take card either in-store or at the door...after some persuasion she was kind enough to take my card over the phone; it declined TWICE because my bank saw it as suspicious. Ended up using my PayPal mastercard and it went right through.  So mostly a PSA, choose your payment method wisely, I was terrified I was going to look like a total douche :P

t3_29a5mo	1403911227.0	mastergrumpus	pizza	[Meta] The Perspective of a Pizza Giver	Hey, /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza!  I have been having a hard time recently finding someone to give a pizza to.  It's not that there aren't people posting or in need, but as some one blessed with a steady income that can cover the rent, when I buy someone a pizza here, I'd like it to be fun!  I have come over here several times to sift through the past few hours of requests, only to leave the sub uninterested in buying anyone a pizza.  Why is this?  Don't you feel nice after helping out a stranger in need?  Of course I do!  That's why I'll stop into a shop to buy a homeless person a bottle of water or a sandwich or volunteer time.  BUT, the reason I come to this sub is slightly different.  The point, name, and previous state of the sub is Random.  The reason I buy someone a pizza here is also because Reddit allows for funny, random things to happen and this is a great place to for that.  I get that the sub has become more focused on helping those in need, and for the most part that's great.  But, as stated in the sidebar, "...we are not a substitute for r/foodpantry or r/assistance".  If I had wanted to simply help someone in need with a bit of money or food, I'd be on there right now and not here trying (and failing) to find a Request that embodies the spirit of the sub.  **PLEASE try and make this sub just as great for Offerers as it is for Requesters!**  The general repetition of depressing stories (starving college student, down to my last can of beans, account is negative, someone close or a pet died, etc.) has chased me away several times when I was more than willing to give someone a pizza.  I've given about 10 pies at this point, but [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1mv2uy/offer_a_random_act_of_pizza/) was my favorite post, and the one I thought best exemplified what I first found fun about the sub.  [Pizza on, Reddit!](http://waltzofthesaltz.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/ch860927.gif?w=450&h=142)  Edit: **TL;DR:** If you are requesting a pizza, try and make it fun!!!  Offer to stand on your head or turn your shirt inside-out!  Most of us aren't looking to gain something of equal value (gift card, drawing, etc.), just to see someone out there do something silly.	1403915753.0

I've been seeing quite a lot of posts staying in essence "give me a pie and I'll pay it forward, or give in X amount of time" but either yo never see from them again or due to just so many requests they don't get a pie and hence never give one.  What if I told you that RAOP allows you to GIVE a pizza away without having to GET one first. You even get a nice little piece of flair for doing so and the more  you give the better chance of getting better flair.  The more people who "pay it forward" the more people who can get a pizza. I challenge everyone to give at least one pizza before getting a pizza in return and help change the whole "help me first" mentality.

t3_26gb2a	1401034529.0	Leg_Mcmuffin		[META] Do any other "Givers" feel guilty for not giving more?	Sorry, this is bothering me. I have given, and plan on giving at least once per pay period. it makes me happy to help someone, and I can afford it (barely). My only problem here, is I always seem to find someone who needs it more, AFTER I have already gifted someone.   What can we do to draw more generous people here? Has this sub become ridden with scammers or people who fabricate stories? It's so hard to tell sometimes.  I really think people should be limited to the amount of times they can be gifted in a time period. If you really need pizza from a stranger more often than not, you really need to reevaluate your life. I'm not saying that you aren't trying to better yourself, but I feel you guys are taking advantage of a beautiful service. What would you be doing if this sub didn't exist?  Sorry. Just speaking my mind.  **EDIT** - I just had this conversation with someone down below, and I would like everyone to see it.  "I really feel like maybe mods should make the Give-Receive ratio even. Just like credits with Redditgifts. Once you receive, you must give to be able to receive again. If you give a few times in a row, you build up "receive credits" and are able to attain pizza."  Thoughts?	1401047746.0

t3_22j6wl	1396978676.0	flobin	pizza	[META] How to buy pizza (internationally) with bitcoin!	^note: ^this ^guide ^written ^for ^people ^new ^to ^bitcoin  **Why?**   Buying pizza internationally has always been difficult. RAOP does have an [international ordering guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ns3dj/the_definitive_guide_to_ordering_internationally/), but it’s two years old. The main difficulty with ordering pizza internationally stems from the fact that often, when paying for something online using a credit card, you cannot have the delivery address and billing address be in different countries.  But not with bitcoin! A payment in bitcoin is the same regardless of where it was made. So if a merchant accepts bitcoin, it does not matter where the person making the payment is from. Awesome!  **Does it work?**     Yep. [I bought someone pizza using bitcoin](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/21oyfi/offer_buy_a_pizza_with_bitcoin/) a while ago. I live in the Netherlands, they live in the US.  **Okay, so what is this bitcoin thing, anyway?**   Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, digital currency. I know, that’s quite a mouthful. If you want to know more, just head on over to /r/bitcoin and check out the sidebar, check out the [bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page), [trybtc](https://www.trybtc.com/), [this youtube explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo), or [the coinlab bitcoin primer](http://coinlab.com/pdfs/a-bitcoin-primer.pdf).   **Requesting pizza**   The only difference between getting a regular pizza and a bitcoin pizza is that your pizza place needs to accept bitcoins as a form of payment. Sadly, not all pizza places accept bitcoin directly. But there are solutions!  If you live in the US, you can use [pizzaforcoins](http://pizzaforcoins.com/) to order a pizza from Domino’s.    Us Europeans are quite lucky, because Takeaway.com, which operates in several European countries, accepts bitcoin as a form of payment. You can actually order many different kinds of food through their websites. Here’s the list of their subsidiaries:   the Netherlands: [thuisbezorgd.nl](http://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/)   Belgium: [pizza.be](http://www.pizza.be/)   Germany: [lieferservice.de](http://www.lieferservice.de/)   UK: [takeaway.com](http://www.takeaway.com/)   France: [pizza.fr](http://www.pizza.fr/)   Austria: [lieferservice.at](http://www.lieferservice.at/)   Switzerland: [lieferservice.ch](http://www.lieferservice.ch/)   Denmark: [pizza.dk](http://www.pizza.dk/)   Luxembourg: [pizza.lu](http://www.pizza.lu/)   Ireland: [pizza.ie](http://www.pizza.ie/)   Vietnam: [vietnammm](http://www.vietnammm.com/) (I know, Vietnam isn’t in Europe, but I might as well list it, right?)  Sweden has [pizza24.se](http://pizza24.se/) and Norway has [pizza24.no](http://pizza24.no) (thanks /u/tearr). If you’re in Dubai, go with [thepizzaguys.ae](http://www.thepizzaguys.ae/).  I am unaware of pizza for bitcoin options in other countries, so if you know any, please do share!   **Ordering/Offering/Giving/Paying for pizza**   Ordering pizza using bitcoin is actually quite easy.  1. *Getting bitcoins*   Obviously, in order to buy someone pizza with bitcoins, you will need to have bitcoins. If you already have some, you can skip this step.   Bitcoins can be obtained in several ways. You can ‘mine’ it, using specialized hardware; you can trade goods or services for it (i.e. work and get paid in bitcoins), much like regular cash; or simply buy some. For our purposes, buying is the best option, as it is the fastest. Bitcoins can be bought on an exchange—a website where you can exchange fiat (dollars, euros, etc.) for bitcoins. The best exchange depends on your location—not all exchanges operate everywhere.   In Europe, some US states, and South Korea [Kraken](https://kraken.com/) is a good option. The number two most used exchange in Europe is [bitcoin.de](https://bitcoin.de/). A note for people with Dutch and Belgian bank accounts: if you want bitcoins instantly, use [bitonic](https://bitonic.nl/), as they use iDeal/Mister Cash.   In the US, the most used exchange is [btc-e](https://btc-e.com/), although personally I am wary of them. Another much used exchange for USD is [bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), whom I’m not familiar with, and there is [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/) as well.   There are many more exchanges, most of which can be found through [bitcoinaverage](https://bitcoinaverage.com/#EUR). And of course I have to mention [localbitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/), a global exchange where you can even meet sellers in person and pay in cash.   You should know that creating an account on one of these exchanges usually involves a verification process, often using scans of documents such as your ID or a bank statement. This process can sometimes take more than a day!   Now that you have bitcoins, the best thing to do is not to leave it sitting on the exchange, but to put it in a wallet you control. There are multiple options, many of which are outlined at [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). My personal favorites are [Electrum](https://electrum.org/) (OS X, Linux, Windows, Android) and [Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) (Android). 2. *Paying for pizza*   It’s time to pay for someone’s pizza! You can either post an offer, or respond to someone’s request. If you are responding to a request, make sure that the pizza place they are ordering from accepts bitcoin payments!   In order to pay the bill, you will need to know two things: the address to send the bitcoins to and the amount that you need to send.   You can either order the pizza yourself entirely, using the address someone gave you, or let them order for themselves. In the latter case, they can send you the URL of the transaction page; they can send you a QR code of the transaction that you can scan (the Android app I linked earlier would work well with this); send you the actual transaction link (it will start with bitcoin://) or simply pm you the address and amount. 3. *???* 4. *Pizza!*   And of course, if someone bought you pizza, don’t forget to say thanks!  That’s basically it. I hope this guide was helpful and that many a pizza will be bought using bitcoin. If you have any questions, feel free to ask—I will do my best to answer them.  P.S. Did you know [someone](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2013/12/23/the-bitcoin-pizza-purchase-thats-worth-7-million-today/) [once](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-infamous-bitcoin-pizzas-are-now-worth-6-million-2013-11) [paid](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/this-pizza-is-worth-750000) [10000 bitcoins for two pizzas](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1qq3ro/til_a_guy_paid_10000_bitcoin_for_2_pizzas_or/)?	1400774568.0
t3_21n5sd	1396058722.0	Lxjones5	pizza	[Meta] Gifted my first random acts of pizzas today. What I learned/tips.	I joined this subreddit earlier this week and offered a scavenger hunt contest on Wednesday. I gifted the 6 winners pizzas today. Here is what I've learned:  1. It feels great! The recipients are EXTREMELY appreciative and gracious.  I recommend any lurkers here with the means to make an offer. It is highly rewarding!  2.  E-gift cards may seem like the easiest route, but may not turn out to be. Domino's asks for recipient(s) names and if you don't know them, DO NOT enter some bizarre combination of the Redditor's username. This landed me in a security tangle that took many emails and phone calls to resolve.  This was just stupidity on my part, but I'm new at this! Just make up a normal sounding name. It shouldn't matter so long as the email goes through (I assume this was the issue, but never got confirmation of it).  3. Pizza Hut e-gift card was very straightforward and simple. They even send you a confirmation when the recipient opens their email, so you know they got it. That said, I did have the recipient's actual name.  4. Surprisingly, calling the local preference of the recipient and either a) ordering and paying for what they want for pick-up, or b) ordering them a gift certificate for pick-up, turned out to be the easiest. Plus you get to support local businesses and ensure the recipient gets what they really like!  Finally, I apologize if all of this has been said before. Again, new here and learned a lot that might be helpful for other new subscribers that aren't going to scour the threads for this. Thanks!	
t3_21inb3	1395939281.0	J_for_Jules	FAP	[Meta] Question about tipping a RAOP	I recently found this sub and it's pretty neat, but I have a question about tipping.

t3_21gib5	1395875567.0	jackelfrink	pizza	[meta]The typical once a month "this is suppose to be random pizza, not charity pizza" rant.	Im well aware that sob stories have always been the rule rather than the exception around this place. Even before I became an active member. And almost like clockwork, there are regular posts whining and complaining about how the sidebar says we are not a substitute for r/foodpantry or r/assistance and grousing about how the tales of woe and distress have gotten out of hand.  I have been around for a while now. I guess its my turn to make that rant.  For the first time in weeks, I finally saw an offer that wasn't just playing into the r/foodpantry -slash- r/assistance trope and actually honestly sent out a pizza at random. Maybe it wound up going to someone down on their luck. Maybe to someone doing well. Maybe to someone depressed. Maybe to someone who had a great day. It wasn't anything need based at all. Just a a totally out of the blue freebie to someone the poster did not know.  It had more down-votes than up-votes.  Now yes, the moderators can take some blame for actively encouraging sob stories and charity mentality. But actively down-voting something for not fitting into the woe-is-me guilt trip acts of mercy? Doesn't that signal that the community here simply prefers charity over randomness? Is it finally time to just admit defeat and realize that "today you tomorrow me" philanthropy is the ~real~ purpose behind this subreddit?  I know this post will get absolutely no place. And there will be another 'what ever became of the "random" in random acts of pizza' coming along after mine. But I just had to vent.	1395883757.0

So I deliver for a major chain. I don't make a ton of money, but I love what I do. Interacting with people, especially in a college town is a bunch of fun and overall is a pretty cool job for a college kid.  Now I'm going to assume, having thought out every possibility, that the pizzas are bought for your Redditor using a credit card. That's great and all, and it makes it really easy for me and the recipient at the door. But then they are faced with an interesting conundrum.  They get asked to sign for it. Okay, so what do you do? It seems like most people tip a little bit, understanding it is where most of our income comes from. But how much, if any, do you give using someone else's money?  The great thing is, you can leave a tip while ordering online, and the recipient can avoid the entire awkward situation, while I don't curse in my car for not making money. The option should be available when entering your credit card info. And if you're ordering over the phone, you can tell them you would like to add a tip. Anything works, and it'll make a second person's day even more awesome.  I do hope this post doesn't come across as pretentious, and if this issue has come across in another post I apologize. I am trying to do this for other drivers out there that work as hard as I do to make their living. Even a dollar or two is awesome and much appreciated!

While need based posts may get attention or garner the goodwill of others they carry no more validity or weight behind them than a person who simply wants pizza. A giver is allowed to choose who they wish to give to for whatever reason they deem fit (within reason).  As stated in the sidebar, we are not a substitute for /r/food_pantry[1] or /r/assistance[2] . If your situation is dire please seek help there.  Additionally the sidebar contains the rules you must follow in order to use RAOP, which, contrary to what some may think, is a privilege, not a right.  Due to the potential for/history of scammers on the board we can and will ban those who we feel are violating the spirit of RAOP.  TL;DR: Need based posts/sob stories carry no more weight than anyone just wanting a pizza.

I'd also like to remind the community that if you see such behaviors to report it privately to the moderators as we discourage starting drama on threads.  Always feel free to come to us with any questions or concerns you may have. 	
t3_1mfudb	1379263509.0	shrapnull	shrapnull	[Meta] International Giving	I have had zero luck sending pizza to other countries lately.  The ecards are all localized, and I'm looking for a better way to send from the USA to our friends across the pond.  If you have had an international giving success story, would you mind sharing how you pulled it off?  I'm done with direct transfers to PayPal (scammers), but paying for the pizza *with* Paypal directly to the store is still an option.  I'm just fishing for options here and hoping others can share their experience.  Maybe we can put it all together to update the old guide.	
t3_1mfjxf	1379252645.0	LordGrayHam		[Meta]Pizza night?	Hey guys, I'm an RAOP noob, but I had this idea.  Maybe if there was enough interest, we could have a night/evening where everyone hangs out in the chat room, and we can order pizzas for each other. Everyone gets a pizza, but with some extra love attached. People could try some new pizzas if they'd like, and we'd all have a happy, pizza-filled time.  Just a quick thing I thought up while browsing. Might have a few flaws, but I'm sure we can figure something out. Any suggestions are appreciated!

I have a few codes that I have not seen on the codes list, but they only work in Tennessee. You can also request these coupons from me if you are giving pizza to someone. If you aren't living in Tennessee, still message me and I will see what I can do. Don't forget "givers", the more pizza you order, the more Papa points you get which means MORE free pizza! Thanks guys! Keep on giving!

We wanted to bring in a little help before the [BBC interview](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1l7cew/meta_bbc_radio_4_call_for_stories_from_all_raop/) airs **worlwide** on October 7th. [Gadianton](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gadianton/) will have move information coming on that.      AutoModerator was a long time coming for us. It was created by a wonderful user [Deimorz](http://www.reddit.com/user/Deimorz/). All AutoModerator is set up to do is remove submissions by those who don't meet the minimum age requirements. This will save us from verifying every single user to make sure they met the one month rule. We are also throwing around other ideas that can be implemented with this, and we will let you guys know if anything else changes.      Lastly, play nice everyone. If you don't like a request there is no need to comment negatively. Just move along. If you see something that seems fishy message us, report the post, etc.      That's it for now. Thanks to everyone in this community because you guys make all this possible.

I realize that when someone posts an offer for a pizza, everyone would like to be considered. That said, downvoting a post in an offer thread into oblivion simply because you want your request to rise to the top seems petty, especially for one of Reddit's kindest subreddits.

Grift grub from the denizens of Reddit. In their quest for “karma,” redditors engage in what they call “random acts of pizza”: Do-gooders will email gift cards for free pizza if they’re sufficiently moved by someone’s plight. Here are some helpful tips for turning a (fake) sob story into a pizza magnet. —James McGirk  >Bill Hader’s Pro Tips: “DON’T bring a knife to a gunfight. DO bring a knife to a pillow fight. Or a pillow to a gunfight. Or whiskey to a cockfight. Or a cock to a whiskey fight.”  >DO be an everyman. People help those who remind them of themselves, so it’s better to act temporarily embarrassed than com­pletely pathetic. So: You just put your cat to sleep; you’re sick of ramen. Professional beggars constantly vary their pitches—follow their lead and experiment.  >DON’T use your real identity. You’ll need a variety of plausible sock puppets—an out-of-work hand model, a hungry gamer. To prevent abuse (ha!), Reddit requires accounts to be at least a month old before they can post on Random_Acts_of_Pizza. Be sure to create a few in advance.  >DO be willing to barter. The original subreddit has a fairly strict moderation system, but on the seedier forks you can post come-ons like “Wife has the day off and is hungry. Pics for trade?” Don’t use your own pictures, and use Imgur to strip any pesky metadata that might out you as a cheat.  >DON’T feel ashamed. Ask people why they send food to strangers and a common reply is “Feels good, man.” Get it? You’re making someone happy. As for whether it’s worth all the trouble, remember what Abbie Hoffman once said about shoplifting groceries: The food just tastes better. 	1373987677.0

On June 1st I was putting on a car show event at a place in Dallas called Autosource. We asked the secretary to order 8 pizzas for everyone, and she ordered 80. No lie.  It was our fault, so we paid for the pizzas... fed them to everyone... but still had 50 or so left over. What to do? No-one was sure what we could do, but I had an idea.  I asked the owner of the place, Al, if we could borrow one of his cars to fill to the top with pizza, and deliver them to the homeless on the street. He agreed! We choose a Fisker Karama because it was charged, available, and could hold nearly 50 pizzas. What we could not fit in the car was given away via craigslist in the free ad's.  I took a camera with us to film the delivery, and when I got back and actually got to see the footage I found it very uplifting. I realized that I am a selfish person and I need to do stuff like this far, far more often.  This was a Random Act of Kindness, and it was very rewarding for me emotionally. My friends who have seen the video agreed, and I figured maybe you guys on Reddit would too.  Thanks for the Pizzas Autosource. :)  Video link here. - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8tbBZgaM-s

We exist on the basis of gifting random pizzas to any person for any reason.  It can be for charity, it can be for boredom, it can be because they like your username...it doesn't matter!   I would like to reiterate that our subreddit does not stand for witch hunts.  Should you have substantial proof of a scammer (multi account user, similar nick trick, etc.) **MESSAGE THE MODS WITH YOUR PROOF.**  If you come across a post that is vague or confusing, ask the OP *tactfully* to clear up the discrepancy.  Should you desire MORE personal information on the OP, please be conscientious enough to know when to move your questioning to PM.  If you weren't going to gift the requester in the first place, please don't waste your time, the OPs time, and the moderators' time by turning the OPs thread into a flame war.    Our community is amazing.  Recently, you all have done wonderful things for Boston and Waco in their time of tragedy.  Let's keep this generosity and kindhearted spirit going.  If you see abusive comments report them.  If you see scammers report them.  Speculating and assuming is not enough proof to tear someone's thread apart and personally attack an individual.  You will be banned for doing so as we do not tolerate harassment.  If you suspect something dishonest always feel free to put the mods on alert with WHY you feel something is suspicious, and we will look into it.  We are here to help you.    Thank you for reading, folks.  Have a great weekend!	
t3_1djf9y	1367479507.0	OliverTw1st	linkpizza	[META] PLEASE READ!!! Information for Givers/Offerers.	    This post will be updated as needed (updated 11/7/2013)   Your incredible acts of generosity have kept us growing at an incredible pace. In the short time I've been here, the subreddit has nearly doubled in subscribers. We have been featured in several media outlets, numerous /r/bestof threads, and countless person to person referrals of the "magic" that goes on here. All this attention has brought it's share of more incredible givers, new requesters, and just like anything else, dishonest people that are looking for ways to game and scam the system.     **The only real way to combat these lowlifes is with an increased awareness in verifying who you are giving to.**  List of things to look for and best practices:  * **Account Name** - Verify that the person you are intending to give to is the person you are corresponding with. **The easiest way to do this is to PM them first!!!** I personally will not reply to any request related PMs unless I first initiated it. Use the [messages view in your inbox](http://i.imgur.com/mFOTk7Z.png) to help with this. It puts a conversation in a thread, with your portion in green text. The nature of way Reddit is setup allows for easy anonymity among its users. One of the things that makes Reddit great for some subs but troubling for ours is that throwaway accounts are so easy to create. People who are scamming generally create accounts similar to the ones intended to be given to by givers (for instance I am /u/OliverTw1st, a scammer might make an account called /u/0liverTw1st in an attempt to trick the giver.) The vast majority of transactions that occur are by sending e-gift cards directly to the recipient's email address and once they have gotten the e-gift card, it is used almost immediately. **The moderators and admins can't help once the order has been placed, and usually the companies that the GC are ordered through won't offer refunds or reversals onces the GC has been redeemed. If you feel you have been scammed, contact the GC company immediately!**  * **Account History** - Specifically AGE. **Scammers accounts are typically less than a day old, because they were created to look similar to the recipient that they just found out about.** We enforce  a 60 day account age minimum for posts and encourage gifters to use one when choosing a recipient as well. It takes less than 10 seconds to click on someone's account name and [verify their age in the top right of their profile screen](http://i.imgur.com/UONGNa7.png). If you use something like[ RES \(Reddit Enhancement Suite\)](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/), you can just[ mouse hover over their name](http://i.imgur.com/oHJtMt4.png) and it will tell you the account age as well.   * **Contests/Offers** - When you choose a recipient for your contest/offer, don't announce it publicly until you have made contact (by PM'ing them first) with the intended recipient. You can edit your post to add something like "Winner chosen, PM'ing them now" and go back and fill in the winner or comment on their comment in the thread once you have made the transaction. **It's a lot harder for scammers to impersonate someone if they don't know who to impersonate.**  * **When Responding on a thread** - Use the receiver's account name somewhere in your public response to the thread. If it's someone's request, say "PMing you now (account name)". If it's a contest/offer you are doing, you can also do that or edit your post to reflect you you gave to. **This helps us track the people who delete their posts to try to hide history of receiving.** They cannot remove your comments or posts that have their account name listed in them.  * **When you've completed a transaction** - Message the mods. Please include a link to the thread. We can then assign you and the receiver the appropriate flair. It also helps us establish a record when investigating deleted posts.    * **When in doubt** - Message the mods **BEFORE making a transaction** if you have any questions. We are here to help make the RAoP experience a good one. [Message us from the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRandom_Acts_Of_Pizza) or stop in to the [IRC Channel](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com/chat). There is usually someone around that can help. We do volunteer our time between work, sleeping and life in general, but we are pretty good at getting back to you within a reasonable amount of time. We will do what we can to help but as stated earlier, once the transaction has been completed, we can't really do anything about it.   [**Random Acts of Pizza**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza/) is an amazing community made up of Redditors from all over the globe and all walks of life, brought together by the simple fact that **MOAR pizza makes the world a better place**. RAoP has the most subscriptions of any Random Acts subreddit and is in my opinion one of the top (and easily the most thoughtful) reasons why Reddit is such an awesome social experiment in the digital age. **Our success can be solely pointed to our givers that make our subreddit such an amazing place and their generosity is responsible for helping to restore people's faith in humanity on a daily basis.**   In the year or so that I have been involved with RAoP, I have seen unbelievable acts of kindness on behalf of you all. From the truly random (and sometimes bizarre) request for pizza fulfilled, helping a fellow Redditor who is down on their luck, contests that spark the creatively genius and hilarious entries from participants, and most recently the tremendous out pour of relief during tragedies. We may only make the news from time to time, but I have the privilege of witnessing it every day.

When s/he responds, I check their comment history by clicking on his/her highlighted name after "from" to verify I've indeed been contacted by the person I want to donate to.  This helps prevent scammers using similar names to get unwarranted round pies of love.  **EDIT:**  A wise moderator suggested the following:   **You should PM the requester first asking for contact info and pizza choice. If you PM them first, then you don't run into issues with people with fake names PMing you.**	1367329220.0

t3_1bp45q	1365118743.0	SET_UP_US_THE_BOMB		[meta] Which of the "big 3" do you prefer? Why?	The recent post about Domino's white sauce has got me thinking (and I am sure this has been asked, but there has been a lot of new subscribers lately)!  I am always torn when I have the choice.  I prefer each chain for their own strengths:  **Pizza Hut -** STUFFED CRUST OMFG@@@!!!!!  Also decent the next day.  Go to if my wallet is full and I have a pizza craving (IE never).   **Papa John's -** Pretty good fresh.  Best of the 3 the morning after!  Definitely best for longevity.  Sauces are pretty good too.   **Domino's -** Variety and price.  Love me some thin crust + white sauce!  The 3 medium/$5 each deal can't be beaten when there's different taste buds in the house.  *I guess ultimately I would go with* ***PJ's***.  I like my pizza to last and I honestly think Papa John's is better on the second day than it is the first!  Viva la breakfast pie!

t3_1bbtap	1364685340.0	danielblakes	pizza	[Meta] an idea for coupon codes	Does anyone else think it would be cool to have some kind of system where RAOP users could put discount/free codes for pizza where everyone else could view them. Something like www.retailmenot.com but only for pizza codes (at the big 3 i guess), and that has some sort of distinction for region-specific codes (since, this weekend alone, for example, papa johns has 3+ region specific codes (magicwin, Rangers7, JaxEWS)).

This scam has been around for awhile now but seems to be revving up again.  It is safer to PM the person you are going to give to, than to have them PM you.  Comment so other people know the requester is being taken care of, then send a PM to the person yourself so you know that is who you are giving to.  IF you don't please pay attention to the redditors name.  If you are giving to iwantpizza, you may get a PM from iwantpiza or lwantpizza.

Some rules to emphasize, as they are banable offenses.      * Do NOT delete requests and comments. That includes entries in contests where you won.  * **You must have an account age of one month (where it actually says "redditor for 1 month" in your user page) in order to post.**   * Do NOT PM people for pizza   * Request once every few days   * Do NOT use multiple accounts      Also, a few things that aren't really rules, but are considered etiquette.      * Do not jump on others requests. If you see another request getting fulfilled, good for them, but it isn't a place where you should ask for one from the giver.   * There seems to be a lot of sore losers lately. If you lose a contest, there is nothing a mod can do. Please continue to report contests that never get fulfilled or if something seems off.      Please report any requests that don't meet the age requirement. Please message us if a user is deleting requests. Please report any posts that a verbally abusive or derogatory as it can be hard to check every single comment in the sub.      EDIT: Formatting/spelling	1361803547.0

But I often come across brand new accounts with no Karma.  (Note: Karma means jack squat to me, I'm talking about someone that's been on the boards for a while, just ran into some hard times and would like a treat...vs. someone just commenting for a pie.)  I guess I "trust" someone more that just randomly needs a helping hand.  Is that wrong?  Would anyone be mad if I gave out a Pizza in such a way?  Thanks for reading!

I plan on becoming an active pizza giver and give back as soon as I get an income of some sort since I have been shown kindness before. It's **not required** that I receive one to get breadsticks coupons so I'll give them out by **10pm EST** regardless. Just post anything. Thank you and good luck!

t3_13d1qe	1353179593.0	xur17		[Meta] Pizza Coupon Tracker	Full disclosure: I run this site.  This site was pretty popular when I posted it in a comment to a previous post, and it was recommended that I make a meta post about the site.  **What is it?** This is a site that tracks pizza coupons (currently Papa John's and Domino's), and shows which coupons work at specific stores. You type in your zipcode, select your store, and a list of working coupon codes appears. These codes are verified daily.  **Why did I make the site?** Most pizza codes only work at certain stores, and only work for a short amount of time. I really wanted an easy way to just find a list of codes that work for a store, without randomly typing in codes that I find on sites like retailmenot. I also had some free time between school quarters, and was looking for a project to teach me html, php, mysql, and python.  **Are more stores going to be added?** Not in the immediate future (I'm pretty busy with school), but I'm open to suggestions.  Feel free to ask any questions you may have, I'm happy to answer them!  Link: [PizzaCodes.com](http://pizzacodes.com)	1369111980.0

This will only be for those posting a request. Young accounts will still be able to participate in other aspects of the community (contest as per the givers rules, offers, posting coupons, etc). This will be a manual process at first then we will eventually put in a bot to do this for us. Please report any requests from accounts that do no meet this requirement for now. We also are removing requests at our discretion if we feel users are solely using reddit for RAOP. That means an account that may be exactly one month old, but has no history, may be removed as well.      There are a variety of reasons for this that we can discuss in the comments. We aren't trying to focus on being a charity, and unfortunately sites like WUAH and TOW like to use us as one. Keep in mind this isn't the only reason.      As always please remember to not use multiple accounts, don't delete posts, and follow all rules in the sidebar to the right.

For those who don't remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/11z669/meta_papa_johns_coupon/) was posted a bit ago.  Once it was deleted it was near impossible to find again, and no traces of the internet have it that I could see except for RAOP.  Today is Monday, the day after all the NFL games, and the code will not work.  Did this code *ever* work?  Does anyone know where to find a major coupon of more than 25% off for today?  I'm going to keep researching and post my results, any help would be appreciated!   Edit: As a test, I have put in addresses for locations in Texas, Wisconsin, Florida, Utah, Colorado, and now Virginia.  Nothing works...grr.  Edit 2: Works in Canada, where they do not have NFL teams, huh?	1352752922.0

By God's grace, your good vibes, and the 24/day work of power company workers from all over the country who headed to the Northeast to get us back from the stone age quick (yesterday, I was told it would be another week)  I am literally awestruck and humbled by so many redditors...*friends*...who were concerned, and even offered help.  Y'all know who you are.  And I'm humbled and blessed to know all of ya...and with so many people around here who lost their homes, and some even lost their lives, those are the people who really need help...money, supplies, and prayers...whatever I've lost is inconsequential compared to so many others in neighborhoods like Breezy Point, Queens and the Rockaways, and Staten Island...the borough most of us love to hate usually. They were all hit hard by the storm.  Not to mention, NJ and CT and other areas in the region.    Keep them in your thoughts and prayers...as you guys and gals are always in mine.  <3  JB

When you call, tell them you are donating to the Breezy Point deliveries. You don't have to pay for a whole pizza, just whatever you can. They are tracking where the donations are coming from as well and I'll try to update this with info as we get it in. If you call and it's busy, try back. Here's the link to the place that's doing it. http://www.pizzashops.info/NewYork/Brooklyn/PizzaDAmore/ They're trying to send pizza, hero sandwiches, and salads.   EDIT: If they get enough donations, they'll include Rockaway and some other areas.  EDIT 2: So far they've received $350 in donations.   EDIT 3: Delivery being made: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/fRemb.jpg) They'll do more deliveries as people donate. They are delivering to the Rockway Peninsula.   EDIT 4: over $700 donated. Last night they delivered 20 pizzas. 5 more pizzas and a large tray of baked ziti is being delivered to a clean up effort which involves a large family and 6 volunteer firefighters from Boston who came down just to help. At the same time, many pizzas are also being delivered to SilverGull Beach Club to feed the displaced residents. 	1352052989.0

t3_11yqd6	1351023136.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	[META] Downvoting Thoughts and Experiment	The mods have been experimenting with allowing downvotes in the past month.  Downvoting is a big part of other sub-reddits and we wanted to see if we could incorporate it here without abuse.    Unfortunately, so far most of us are seeing too much downvoting abuse.  The idea of downvoting is to remove abusive and inappropriate comments.  Things like name calling and hateful comments should be downvoted.  Everything else should be left alone or upvoted.  Right now we have disabled post downvoting, but have allowed comment downvoting with a pop-up reminder to only downvote abusive comments.    We are going to leave it like this and evaluate next week whether we'll keep the downvoting or remove it altogether.    Right now our inclination is to go back to no downvoting.  We'd like your thoughts on the matter.

Does it bother anyone else that so many people who have already been pied (most times multiple times, and haven't paid it forward) continue to post in contests and make requests? There's so many people here who are in just as much of a pickle who have never received a pizza, you'd think spreading the love around would be better. Not gonna name and shame, but there's a lot more than a handful of accounts like that. Is it selfishness? Am I just being jealous? Random acts of pizza hasn't really been so random at least 80% of the time. Is it just some people's stories tend to gain more cheesy love? Their way of typing? Being a student? Being a girl?

It seems like ALL this place is now is filled with requests from starving broke people looking for a handout.  The "Random" is almost completely gone!

t3_zptug	1347383585.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	[META][BRAINSTORMING][THE STATE OF RAOP] Donation links? 501(c)(3)?  Other ideas?	I know I have been low key for a while (I mostly like giving anonymously).   But RAOP is never far from my thoughts.  I have been thinking about a couple of ideas for RAOP for a while.  I have discussed this a bit a couple of times in the IRC channel.  (Everyone really should come hang out there... I'm on that chat channel all day during the work week along with lots of other awesome RAOP folks).  Anyway,  1) What do you guys think about adding some sort of Donation link to accept donations that we could then use for giveaways?  The reddit admins have added a couple of solutions that would let us do this.    Some of the ideas we've had is we could hold weekly/monthly giveaways, or use the donations to find un-filled requestors.  2) I have also thought about forming a 501(c)(3) charity that would allow donations to RAOP to be tax deductible at least in the US.    So let's use this thread to discuss these ideas and any other ones.    EDIT:  Ok after some discussion, what I am leaning towards is a 501c3 to bring in some tax benefits to givers along with personal liability protections for the people running it.  A donation link to the 501c3.  And a open accounting method with 100% going to the charitable purpose (admin costs donated so they will be 0).  Then we'd take those funds, as they allow, have a big giveaway thread to bring in more of the Reddit community, where the receivers are chosen randomly.  ... perhaps with some eligibility going to those that have given before... or some other combination.	1347411918.0

t3_zlfuw	1347178556.0	T_Dumbsford		[Meta] Tips for pizza delivery?	Serious question, please go easy on me if its a stupid one. I've lurked around here for a while now, never requested or offered but I'm pretty sure its a matter of time before I do both.  So I was writing in a tip for the pizza guy tonight and it just dawned on me out of the blue: Do drivers delivering Random Acts of Pizza get tipped? So many requests I see involve people being broke, no money, no food, etc. If you're destitute, you have no means to tip, right? I realize not every beneficiary of pizza is broke, and not every single pizza gets delivered, but enough seem to be that I'm wondering if this isn't a problem.  I worked in a lot of pizza shops back in the day, so I know how it is. If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to order. Some places will let you add a tip on credit/debit cards when you order, but its generally discouraged. And I don't know how you'd do it with a gift card. Online ordering for major chains have no provision for tipping. The only way I could think to make it work would be to call the place yourself, pay with plastic and hope they let you put a tip on there. That would involve the requester giving the benefactor an address and possibly a phone number, which isn't cool. So, just saying.  Maybe you guys have got this covered, I don't know. If so, please enlighten me. I don't want to gift a pizza if some wage slave somewhere is going to get stiffed because of it.

t3_zar3a	1346705502.0	Rollout	Rollout	[META] Changes	Most of you know I was going to go. Many have encouraged me to stay, and try to fix what I see wrong. Here we go...  Many people have complained about some things here. The RAOPBOT inaccuracy for one, removal of posts, and more.  While we all really applaud the work of the bot creator, the bot is gone. It was more annoyance than it was good to many. Perhaps in the near future we can come up with a way to duplicate a way to keep track. The flair system being updated with multiple mushrooms for receivers is one idea that I was thinking of.  Going forward, posts that are not formatted correctly will not be removed, instead (see the sidebar), they will be slightly smaller, and light grey. This makes them still clickable, readable, but should encourage people to format posts correctly without the need for moderator policing. Since this is an automated process it will be completely the responsibility of the poster to get it right.  In the start of this we did some things very differently. We let the community police itself up to a point. The community would downvote, or ignore users that they felt were taking advantage, or being dishonest. I would like to see that again.  The overriding rules here are to be nice, and remember that we are just talking about a pizza, it is most likely going to someone who needs/wants it. If someone does take advantage, oh well it is what 10 bucks or so?.  If you don't have something nice to say, don't say it. If you do not want to buy someone a pizza, then don't do it, don't even comment in the post. If you have some proof of a scammer, or a otherwise dishonest person, let the mods know. We are here to keep the peace, which includes removing the people starting witch hunts, and those taking serious advantage... Keep in mind that we do allow people to ask every couple days, as long as they are up front and honest about how many times they have gotten before (this in no way makes it so that you have to buy them a pie...)  Please remember that ultimately the gift of a pie is up to the giver, so is any research. If a giver does not look through a users history, see if they have been a redditor for a while, see that they post in just assistance type sites, use of the verification system, etc... It is all on them... It is up to them if they just want to give, or be cautious..  This is supposed to be a positive community, let's all do our part to make it that way.  More changes to come... Some quite big, like a community donation pool, with giveaways and such....  We always welcome suggestions, but keep in mind that the focus here is to not be a police state, and just keep us mods as peacekeepers. We tend to push people away when we go too far, thus the current changes we are making.   Edit: Also, as I noted in a comment below... Why is it that we give so much attention to these scammers? It seems that is one of the number one words around here. The majority of the people here are honest, and we should remember that. Do not let a few bad apples spoil the batch... 	1346719169.0

Sorry if this seems a little irrelevant, but I'm cross-posting it here because a lot of (pizza) giveaways happen here. Hopefully this site will help someone. (Mods, feel free to include this in the sidebar or anything :))  Raffling on reddit can be a big pain, since you usually have to pick a number, and OP has to random it, and find your number. This can cause a lot of problems if you're late to the party, or want minimum age/karma requirements (to prevent alts).  If you're holding a raffle, please use my site instead of making people pick random numbers! It's kind of a pain for both the participants to pick numbers, especially if you're late to the party and have to find one that's not taken.  This site automatically detects multiple entries. If you post more than once, you will only be entered **once**. The raffler may choose to use filters to *only* enter comments with "entering", or not enter comments with "not entering" (for example, these filters may be any character/words). You may also specify minimum comment/link karma, and account age. Once again, these are filters for the raffler to specify himself.  Do let me know what you think, either here on Reddit or via the [contact form](http://redditraffle.com/contact.html).  Thanks for reading!

t3_uwcjk	1339432782.0	qyll		[Meta] Domino's pizzas are 50% from 6/11 to 6/17.	I don't know if this works everywhere, but at least where I live (Boston), if you order online, you can put in the code "50OFF" and get any menu price pizza for 50% off. Artisan pizzas are now 4 bucks a pop.  Just a heads up for all the kind RAoP'ers out there.

t3_szv2l	1335800869.0	way2funni	pizza	[META] Papa Johns is doing 9 buck large pies today with promo code  899T4T	Just go to papajohns.com and order as you like and use promo 899T4T and you should see the discount. ALL large pies are 9 bucks. Meat lovers, THE WORKS etc etc - up to 7 TOPS. LOADED PIES.  [edit] Normally their Large Pies are $12 - you save 3 bucks which is their normal delivery charge anyway so it works out to free delivery. It's been pissing rain here in North Miami Beach for 3 days straight so the timing worked out for me - I'm not leaving the house if I don't have to.  P.S If you happen to buy a Pie (any pie) for someone here on RAOP today by 6pm EST drop a comment right here and I might buy you a pie - or give it to the Redditor of your choice.  Drop a public comment pointing me in the right direction for confirmation and let's feed some hungry folks some pie!	True

Also, I don't think I've ever seen so many threads of thanks as in the past week or so.  I don't have much tenure in this subreddit, but I must say the generosity of 99.9% of you is truly admirable.  Keep the pies coming and remember to message the mods when a pizza is given or received so we can update flair accordingly.  Thanks for being awesome!	
t3_spgxf	1335241795.0	elgreco927	dragon	[Meta] Why the big surge in RAOP subscribers?	We've just passed the 15K mark.  It seems like we were just at 14K a few days ago.  Does anyone know why there's been such a surge in subscriptions in recent days?	
t3_sjzp4	1334943542.0	xtr2009		[META]  Bad Experience trying to help.	Last night we heard about a local family, mother with 3 children, whose father had passed away recently from cancer and the mother was now diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer.  We heard they needed help with groceries, meals, etc.  Wife and I decided to buy dinner for them in the Spirit of Random Acts of Pizza.  So, we got some information about favorite types of pizza, etc. from the mother and ordered.  A few minutes later the grandmother called and said the family was going out to a science fair at a local school and that they would not be home for the next couple of hours.  This is a problem because the pizzas were being made at that moment.  So, we called Papa John's and had them stop the order.  We asked if they would just deliver the pizzas 2 hours later, but we were told the sale would have to be refunded to our debit card, which would take 7-10 days, and that a new sale would have to be run through on the card for the new purchase 2 hours later.  What?  When I worked at Pizza Hut we had people call in and pay for pizzas to be delivered hours later all the time.  We cannot, for the life of us, figure out why Papa John's has this policy.  The end result, we were not able to assist the family last night and, until we get our refund, we won't be able to assist for another 7-10 days.  WTF?	
t3_s00lu	1333932559.0	tanyagal2	pizza-gold	[Meta]  Reminder:  Watch out for a slight variation on usernames in PM's! It's a scam!	I just caught one where someone replaced an "m" with an "n".  The only way I actually caught them was that I had gifted this user before and remembered that they had a unique email address.  	
t3_pq3ek	1329272965.0	raspberryseltzer	pizza-gold	[META] Guys, please say thanks!	If this is violating the rules, please remove this, mods.  I will not be offended.  However, there were a TON of pizzas given out today--hooray!--and most of you took pictures to get said pizza.  So, I'd like to ask that you all also take pictures of yourself with said pizza and post them with thanks to the fabulous person who took time/money to provide the pie(s).  This can either be in the original thread or a separate post.  I did not contribute to this fantastic giveaway, so I have no stake in this.  However, those who give LOVE seeing smiling faces with pies and, though it can be a bit of a pain, taking those few seconds to take a picture can make a giver's day.  So, c'mon, DO IT!  Pookie85--see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ppyqg/did_you_participate_in_the_valentines_giveaway/)--is compiling pics, and this will make his/her job easier, as well.  Please x/post your links for them so they can make a fantastic video of everyone getting their noms!  Happy Valentine's, regardless, you fabulous folks!
