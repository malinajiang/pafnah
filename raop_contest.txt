t3_50s6ng	1472803436.0	videogamesandtears		[Contest] Recommend a song for me. Best one wins a medium 2-topping pizza!	I'm looking for some new music, and you're looking for a free pizza. Everybody wins! Give me a song to look up. Make sure to provide both the song title and artist, OR provide a YouTube/Soundcloud link.  The song I like best will be the winner. If it's a song I already know and love, it may still be considered.  The pizza will be from Dominos. Medium, up to two toppings of your choice.   I'll leave this up for one week, so until Friday September 9th.  RULES: -Provide the full title of the song and artist OR a YouTube/Soundcloud link. A simply a title with no artist will NOT be considered -Only ONE submission per person PER DAY. Which means each person can have up to seven submissions, as long as they're submitted on different days -Any and all music is accepted. This includes covers, original music, instrumentals, avant garde, etc.  I wish I could help you out by giving you some of my favorite genres, but it's such a wide variety. Modern country if probably the only one that I'm really not a fan of. But honestly, my playlist ranges from punk to folk metal to disco to doo wop to vaporwave (I am not even joking). It's a gosh darn mess.  Anyways, good luck! I'll probably be upvoting some of my favorites periodically throughout the week. Winner will be announced ON THIS THREAD next Friday. I will be contacting them that same day prior to the announcement, and we'll set up the best time for pizza. :)   EDIT: Some typos.  UPDATE 9/5: I've listened to a few of the songs already. Some are pretty good, a few are ok. I haven't heard a single one I outright hate. You guys have some good taste. So far there's been one that REALLY grabbed my attention (I say no more ;) ). I still have more to listen to, and Friday is still days away so keep em coming :)	1473073919.0

t3_4msmk6	1465215391.0	ht00040	pizza-gold	[Contest] $25 Domino's eGift Card for Longest Freshwater Fish	Good morning! I've been busy the past week.  I got a new boat and the kids are done with school for the summer, so we've been doing a lot of fishing.  That gave me an idea for the next contest, which will be an online fishing contest.  This contest will run until next Monday morning to give folks plenty of time to enter.  To enter you must write your Reddit username and the current date on a piece of paper.  Carry that paper with you when you go fishing this week.  When you catch fish, take a picture with the fish, a measuring device (tape measure or ruler commonly found on boats that shows the length of the fish), and the piece of paper.  The Redditor with the longest freshwater fish will be the winner.  You must post a public picture containing those three elements (fish, length, and paper with your Reddit name and the current date) and the public post must also contain text indicating the species of fish and it's length.  You may enter as many times as you like.  Good luck!  &nbsp;   I will also want to have proof that a pizza meal was purchased.  The winner of this contest will be my 20th pizza recipient, so I'm hoping you are able to post a picture of the pizza you receive.  &nbsp;   **Reminders:**  RAOP requires 300 karma or more. I can't see your post if you have less than 300 karma.  Please do not send me a PM asking for pizza.	
t3_4l4txs	1464261992.0	ht00040	pizza-gold	[Contest] $25 Domino's eGift Card for Supporter of Youth Baseball/Softball Game	**Edit:**  Well, that was disappointing.  Looks like I struck out on that one.  Can't hit a home run with every contest I suppose.  &nbsp;   Good morning! This will be my last contest for the week.  This past Sunday I watched a youth baseball game and made a quick offer before I had to leave for the game.  There wasn't enough time for anyone to claim the offer so I suggested Redditors that go to a youth baseball/softball game take a picture at the game with a piece of paper containing their Reddit name and the current date so they could be eligible for a future contest.  Well, that day has come, and it's time to collect your pizza.  Please post the youth baseball/softball pictures you have taken from earlier this week.  &nbsp;   This contest ends today at 4pm CDT.  &nbsp;   I will also want to have proof that a pizza meal was purchased.  The winner of this contest will be my 20th pizza recipient, so I'm hoping you are able to post a picture of the pizza you receive.  &nbsp;   **Reminders:**  RAOP requires 300 karma or more.

t3_4ku1vz	1464100350.0	ONinAB		[Contest] 4/13 - Pizza Across Canada: Saskatchewan Edition	Hi folks! I am continuing my Pizza Across Canada campaign! Over the next while, whenever the mood strikes me, I will be giving away a pizza to someone in each of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories.    This post is for pizza give-away #4 of 13. The province I've randomly chosen for this give-away is SASKATCHEWAN. The winner will be awarded a $20 e-gift card to Boston Pizza and will be required to use the mod-approved verification system, and provide me (via PM) with a valid their email address for e-card delivery. I've chosen BP's not because I think they're the best pizza - I'm sure your local pizzeria is great! - but for ease of transferring pizza e-cards, and because they're a Canadian company that began in Edmonton.  Rules:   * Don't try to scam me with a similar user account as the winner - I will notice and the verification system will find you. Plus, that's a shitty thing to do.  * No PM's - you must post in the comments photographic/video proof that you live or are currently in SASKATCHEWAN.   * The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and the date. Some ideas include:  * A famous landmark;  * A valid student/work ID from a university or municipal/provincial government;  * A GPS showing your location;  * A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the province;  * A Canada Post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark;  * Something incorporating your best Riders sad face, along with any of the above;  * ...or come up with another idea! I should be able to look at the pic and say "Yep, he/she is in SASKATCHEWAN."   This contest will close Friday, May 27, 2016 at 1pm MST.   Remember: The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and the date. After the contest closes, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment.   Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win!    Past Contests: NFLD & LAB, YUKON, BRITISH COLUMBIA, and a bonus ONTARIO award.	1464100790.0

t3_4jw5z8	1463570414.0	ht00040	pizza-gold	[Contest] $25 Domino's eGift Card for Solving the Short Riddle	**Edit:** I wasn't intending to award an eGift card since time had expired, but perhaps there was a miscommunication, so in the end I did provide an eGift card to /u/rubynights  &nbsp;   **Edit:**  Times up.  Nobody was able to answer the riddle before time ran out.  &nbsp;   **Final Note:** I have a lot of Shimano gear.  My road bike has Shimano components and a bunch of my fishing reels are made by Shimano.  That is why I picked them and then picked bands and then songs to create the riddle.  Thank you to everyone that participated!  I had a blast and I hope you had some fun too.  &nbsp;   At about 8:23am CDT this morning /u/ForgotDeoderant asked for an explanation on why people were making their guesses and wanted to know the thought process.  Shortly after that /u/hiddenmoose made a comment indicating it was about 3 songs.  That is correct in that  is the first step in unlocking the riddle.  The comment was subsequently deleted and I assumed /u/hiddenmoose deleted it so it wouldn't help others.  I was sure /u/hiddenmoose was on the right track to solving the riddle.  **Hint #1:** The riddle refers to 3 songs.  You need them to unlock the next step.    **Hint #2:** The songs are: Zamboni, The Divided Sky, Walk on the Ocean  **Hint #3:** The songs were only the first step.  The name of the band will get you to step #2.  **Hint #4:** Today people have guessed: Martin Zellar, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Phish.  The three bands are: Gear Daddies, Toad the Wet Sprocket, Phish  **Hint #5:** I only have one name.  The keywords from the band names are: gear, sprocket, fish  **Hint #6:** I make gears, sprockets, and fishing reels  /u/rubynights was the first to guess Shimano at 8:43pm CDT.  When I did a Google search this morning with gear, sprocket, and fish they came up on the first page.  &nbsp;   **Edit:**  Starting at 8pm CDT I will start unlocking the riddle in about 5 minute increments to see if anyone can figure it out with a little help.  If not I will reveal the answer by 9pm CDT.  **Edit:**  *Note to self: they aren't quite ready for riddles...*  &nbsp;   Good morning! Today you can earn some pizza by solving my short riddle.  &nbsp;   **Riddle:**  I have only one name, and I like to ride my Zamboni across the divided sky so I can walk on the ocean with you.  Who am I?  &nbsp;   This contest ends today at 8pm CDT. I will PM the contest winner to give them the eGift card information.  &nbsp;   I will also want to have proof that a pizza meal was purchased.  &nbsp;   **Reminders:**  RAOP requires 300 karma or more. I can't see your post if you have less than 300 karma. Please do not send me a PM asking for pizza or money.	1463624641.0

I'll definitely do a contest again in the future when I have some more extra cash. :) Thanks for all your stories!**  $20 to wherever you want. I'm located in US. Chains are obviously the easiest. I don't know how to give overseas but if someone shows me and it's not too complicated, I'm willing to do that. I received from here when I was a broke college kid in a very stressful financial situation.  I work in concert production and I can say I love going into work. Every job has good days and bad days, but I wouldn't want to be in any other industry. I whole-heartedly believe that most of the time it is better to live modestly in a job you love rather than make a lot of money and still not being happy.  Tell me what is good about your job! What makes you smile? Are your coworkers fun? Do you like your customers? Do you just really like doing math for your job? Does your coworker have a funny dog?  Bonus points for cool or funny pictures. I want to spread the joy! (Extra pizza to a band on tour who wants to take a new lighting tech.

t3_42cr6a	1453583595.0	jarrettbraun	PIF	[Contest] Super Bowl & Creativity, for a bitter fan...	**CONTEST CLOSED** I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed, but I blame myself. Maybe I put it up too early. Maybe I expected too much out of people. Maybe the community is dying... Whatever the circumstance, I'm saddened by this.   Because I couldn't give anything away this time around, I'll do something new later. I still want to have fun with this. There's nothing I love more than giving away pizza, especially when someone puts at least a LITTLE effort into earning it. I'm not asking for anyone to spend money. Creativity is free and art is everywhere. I wasn't expecting Picasso's or Coen's. I just wanted SOMETHING. *sigh*... On to the next thing.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I give away pizza, I like to get the creative juices flowing. It's important to let yourself shine, regardless of skill levels. I've done creative contests and a Super Bowl contest, so I'm going for the best of both worlds!  I'm a Vikings fan from MN. You can probably guess how I felt watching Blair Walsh attempt that field goal... *sigh*  ANYWAY, I want to some how remind myself about it for the next couple of weeks, until Super Bowl Sunday. THAT'S WHAT THIS CONTEST IS FOR!  I'm looking for creativity and effort. There's a reason I'm posting this two weeks early. **What I'm looking for** is your interpretation of that fateful kick that ended the season for the Vikes. How, do you say? IT DOESN'T MATTER!!! *As long as it's legal!*  **RULES:**  Put in some effort towards something creative. FREE YOUR MIND! Show me the kick, in your own re-telling. This can be ANY art form, from poetry, painting, photography, filmmaking, sculpture, [macaroni art](http://southparkstudios.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/south-park/clip-thumbnails/season-3/0309/south-park-s03e09c05-macaroni-picture-of-the-last-supper-16x9.jpg?), etc... It just SOMEHOW **needs to relate to the kick.**   When creating your masterpiece, please make reference to your username & the date, visually. If your art is poetry, use something other than a computer to write it up, and post it by picture or scan. Real handwriting preferred. Feel free to PM me with any questions  or concerns and I'll be happy to clear them up.  **DEADLINE: SUPER BOWL SUNDAY, FEB 7, 2PM CST. US ONLY.**  The prize will be a GC to one of the big three, in a value of my choosing. I may even pick multiple winners, if I see fit. Good luck to you all!

Maybe it's not so much of a contest as it is a guessing game, but it should work nonetheless. I enjoy rap music. There's a specific rapper who I would say is my favorite of all time. Guess who it is, and I'll buy you a pizza. First one to get it wins, and everyone gets 2 guesses. The artist is not new, not dead, and not finished making music. Good luck RAoP!  Edit: I have to go to work at 5:00pm CST tonight until 8:00pm. While I'm there I will most likely be unable to answer or give hints. If someone or more than 1 someone guess it during that time, I'll let ya'll know ASAP.  Edit 2: it was Kanye. Congrats to the pizza winner, canisithere!	1452651132.0

t3_3vc0b5	1449179155.0	ONinAB		[Contest] 3/13 - Pizza Across Canada: British Columbia Edition	Hi folks! I am continuing my Pizza Across Canada campaign! Over the next while, whenever the mood strikes me, I will be giving away a pizza to someone in each of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories. This post is for pizza give-away #3 of 13. The province I've randomly chosen for this give-away is BRITISH COLUMBIA. The winner will be awarded a $20 e-gift card to Boston Pizza and will be required to use the mod-approved verification system, and provide me (via PM) with a valid their email address for e-card delivery. I've chosen BP's not because I think they're the best pizza - I'm sure your local pizzeria is great! - but for ease of transferring pizza e-cards, and because they're a Canadian company that began in Edmonton.   Rules: * Don't try to scam me with a similar user account as the winner - I will notice and the verification system will find you. Plus, that's a shitty thing to do.  * No PM's - you must post in the comments photographic/video proof that you live or are currently in BRITISH COLUMBIA.  * The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and the date.   Some ideas include:  * A famous landmark;  * A valid student/work ID from a university or municipal/provincial government;  * A GPS showing your location;  * A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the province;  * A Canada Post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark;   * Your sweet new bear bite;   ...or come up with another idea! I should be able to look at the pic and say "Yep, he/she is in BRITISH COLUMBIA."  **This contest will close Friday, December 4, 2015 at 2pm MST. That's just under 24 hours from now.**  Remember: The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and the date. After the contest closes, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment. Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win! Thanks for playing!

We're super pumped to announce that we have FINALLY launched our site [Endangered Box](http://endangeredbox.com/)  I created [Endangered Box](http://endangeredbox.com/) for the same reason anyone tries to change the world. The world needs change and people willing to do. I am one of those people and I actually plan on getting my hands dirty every step of the way. I looked to Reddit for my staff and content because I knew there was a worldwide source of charitable people searching for purpose, just as I was.  My main goals for [Endangered Box](http://endangeredbox.com/) are as follows: Preserve invaluable wildlife for our children and their children, to create a new form of charity (one not built around tax write-offs) and to help people with similar interests achieve their goals of saving these precious creatures.  Our goal for this RAOP is simple. To bribe you into signing up for our mailing list, so that we can eventually convince you to buy a box, and in the process help us make a real difference in this world. Animals are awesome. Pizza is awesome. So enjoy a pizza on us, and in doing so, help us save some animals. Pretty sweet eh?  The rules are simple:  1. Head over to our website [www.EndangeredBox.com](http://endangeredbox.com/) and sign up for our mailing list. (Make sure to confirm your e-mail address).   2. Sit back and wait. We will contact you via e-mail to let you know that you have won.  3. [Tweet us](https://twitter.com/EndangeredBox) a picture with the hashtag #EndangeredBox of you enjoying that sweet, sweet pizza and telling us what your favorite animal is.   Easy peasy.   Edit: We will be selecting five winners at random over the next 2 weeks. Sorry for any confusion. 	1442084661.0
t3_3fqym8	1438697490.0	ONinAB		[Contest] 2/13 - Pizza Across Canada: Yukon edition	Hi folks! I am continuing my Pizza Across Canada campaign! Previously, no one from NL & Lab was interested - but I want to make sure I cover every province and territory! Over the next while, whenever the mood strikes me, I will be giving away a pizza to someone in each of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories. This post is for pizza give-away #2 of 13. The territory I've randomly chosen for this give-away is the YUKON. The winner will be awarded a $25 e-gift card to Boston Pizza and will be required to use the mod-approved verification system, and provide me (via PM) with a valid their email address for e-card delivery. I've chosen BP's not because I think they're the best pizza - I'm sure your local pizzeria is great! - but for ease of transferring pizza e-cards, and because they're a Canadian company that began in Edmonton. I am aware that there is only one BP's in Whitehorse - but free pizza is free pizza.  **Rules:**   * Don't try to scam me with a similar user account as the winner - I will notice and the verification system will find you. Plus, that's a shitty thing to do.   * No PM's - you must post in the comments photographic/video proof that you live or are currently in the YUKON.  * The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and the date. Some ideas include:  - A famous landmark;  - A valid student/work ID from a university or municipal/territorial government;  - A GPS showing your location;  - A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the territory;  - A Canada Post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark; ... or come up with another idea! I should be able to look at the pic and say "Yep, he/she is in the YUKON."   **This contest will close Friday, August, 7, 2015 at 2pm MST.**  Remember: The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and this week's date. After the contest closes, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment. Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win!  Thanks for playing!	1438697858.0

I picked the 2 winners and have been in touch.   The first is /u/edodes who asked for me to pass on the pizza and give to a [charity of their choice, which I've done](http://imgur.com/xqJKxby). Thank you for the work you do with the Georgia SPCA!   The other I'm waiting to hear from and will update as soon as they contact.   Mods can we improve the reddit by making contests more visible?

t3_3cxtnr	1436642098.0	plastic_apollo	FAP	[CONTEST] For the past two years, I've traded a pizza for a photoshop birthday surprise. Let's make it three years in a row! Details inside.	Hi RaoP, I'm thrilled to be making this a tradition with you all!   For the past two years, I've traded a pizza every July 13th in return for some funny photoshops of our dog, an American Eskimo named Albus. The first year, you delivered in a big way and enabled me to create a hilarious Three Eskie Moon shirt. The second year, you allowed me to create an album of our dog in destructive moments of history. [Here's the thread from last year to see some of the pics you created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2ahrk0/last_year_i_gave_away_pizza_in_return_for_your/).  Well, big changes from last year...we no longer have one dog, but two!   The running joke we have is that the two dogs, Albus and Ajax, are mortal enemies, willfully opposed to one another. (It's just a joke, though - they're buddies and love each other, we promise).   **So, this is the contest:**  Create a photoshop of the two dogs in a way that captures the idea of 'enemies meeting, posing, or fighting together.' Be as creative as possible! Ideas include:  -Harry and Voldemort fighting -King Kong holding the lady -Churchill and Stalin meeting -Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker -Etc. - really, anything you can think of that fits the bill. My husband really likes the Legend of Zelda, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and...Jaws. He really likes Jaws. Just do whatever you want that fits the bill!   Really, any two 'enemies' you can think of, fictional or otherwise, will work. I'm thinking that this sort of photoshop will require mostly the use of the dogs' faces, so [here's an album of shots that show their faces pretty well](http://imgur.com/LjWLotZ,MB7Owpe,7yyE27f,0OYSoAk,kwcsgZn,5sfkq7k). Small note: In that first picture, don't use Ajax's face on the left with him in a crate (that pic was from a before/after adoption pic from the first day we got him). Let me know if you need better pics and I'll do my best.  **How to win**:  The winner will be the person who makes me laugh the hardest and who does the best job with their shoop (don't worry, I'm not looking for technical flawlessness - my photos are potato-quality, so I just mean it's a step up from, say, paintshop).   I'll choose a winner by 2 p.m. on July 13th, Pacific Time, and buy you a pizza from your choice of Papa John's, Pizza Hut, or Domino's (whichever I can order from online).   **Tl/dr: Photoshop our dogs for my husband's birthday, win a pizza!**  Thanks RaoP!

So, I'm going to have a contest in her honor.  Write me a limerick about Debbie, the lying, cheating, skank, and I will pick the best one to give a Pizza Hut Gift Card on Friday. **Be sure to follow the rules and keep it safe for work**. /u/DebbiePolizki - you're not eligible. If you wanted a large with extra sausage, you shouldn't have banged Joey "the Fizz" Fizucco under the bleachers during Homecoming in 11th grade. I thought it was going to be different between me and you that time, but I was wrong.  /u/Dynosmite - you're totally eligible still, but the limerick had better be awesome.  **P.S.** Bonus points for drawings of zebras. A winner will be selected Friday at 2:00 PM CDT  **EDIT**: Some of these rhymes are getting... erm....out of hand. Remember to keep it SFW!  **EDIT EDIT**: WE HAVE A WINNER! /u/usernotimportant - Congratulations!

I've got an album of inspiration [here](http://imgur.com/a/WLgGj/all).  I'm going to compile these drawings into a present for my wife, as her birthday is coming up. And I think she'll like anything from /r/dinosaurdrawings to /r/drawing quality, so I'm accepting any submissions not necessarily just drawings either. I mean anything, if you want to sculpt a mini-Dexter in clay, or paint him, or make a 3d model in maya/blender, anything goes.  One winner will be decided by reddit aka most upvotes. The second winner will be decided by myself as most technically difficult. The third will be decided by myself as most unique.  Feel free to make more than one submission, though if you do please separate them into separate posts so the most upvoted will rise to the top.   **Prize Information**  Winners will be decided Friday when I get home from work, between 5 and 6 CST.  In the event of a tie, or one submission wins two categories then that user will receive a $30 gift card and a runner up will receive $20 (there will always be 3 winners).  I'm based in the USA so the $20 gift cards I'm expecting to give out are to Papa John's, Pizza Hut, or Dominos any winners abroad may have to accept dogecoins instead.

t3_33o4m9	1429843639.0	Broken_Slinky	pizza	[Contest](United States) The "Clarissa Explains It All" theme song	I suddenly got the urge to use my Free Papa John's Pizza offer to help someone out this evening. But i didn't want to just hand it out to somebody with the most convincing story.   So instead I ask you to upload a video (anywhere) of you singing the "Clarissa Explains It All" Theme song. Someone to do it decently or creatively gets a free large pizza with three toppings and a side.  Since it's getting a little too late for deliveries on the other side of the US, I will hold off on my decision until evening when I get off work.  All I ask is you be somewhat in need of a free meal. If you can afford a pizza please move on.  **In the video state your Reddit user name, my user name, and the date, be visible, and absolutely no cuts. if *any* of these rules are not followed it will result in a disqualification**   Don't give me a story in your video as to why i should choose you, it wont disqualify you but I will ignore it and if its a really shitty reason it will count against you.  Be creative, just because you're not the first to post doesn't necessarily mean you lose. If the previous poster half assed it and you killed it I will choose you over the other. Also, I may choose more than one winner if I am impressed by multiple people. you can either PM me the video or comment it. If you PM it to me it will remain private even if i choose you as the winner. A winner w  I believe that is everything.   Thank you and good luck  Edit: Formatting

Over the next while, whenever the mood strikes me, I will be giving away a pizza to someone in each of Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories.   This post is for pizza give-away #1 of 13. The province I've randomly chosen for this give-away is NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. The winner will be awarded a $20 e-gift card to Boston Pizza and will be required to use the mod-approved verification system, and provide me (via PM) with a valid their email address for e-card delivery. I've chosen BP's not because I think they're the best pizza - I'm sure your local pizzeria is great! - but for ease of transferring pizza e-cards, and because they're a Canadian company that began in Edmonton.   **Rules: Don't try to scam me with a similar user account as the winner - I will notice and the verification system will find you. Plus, that's a shitty thing to do.** No PM's - you must post in the comments photographic/video proof that you live or are currently in NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR. The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and today or tomorrow's date. Some ideas from /u/elgreco927 include:  * A famous landmark * A valid student/work ID from a university or municipal/provincial government * A GPS showing your location * A driver's license (with personal info redacted, of course) from the province * A Canada Post office, or a piece of snail mail showing a post mark * ... or come up with another idea! I should be able to look at the pic and say "Yep, he/she is in NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR."   This contest will close Friday, April 10th, at 2pm MST. Remember: The photo/video MUST incorporate your username and today or tomorrow's date. After the contest closes, I'll review the entries and pick a winner based on whatever whim strikes me at the moment. Creative photos that take more effort are more likely to win!

A few months ago, one awesome redditor gifted my family with glorious pizza and now, thanks to our tax return, we want to return the favor!

Leave a comment with how many kids you have and share a funny story about your little one(s).  Winner will be picked tonight at 10pm est and I'll send you a PM and update this thread.    EDIT: sorry everyone- I updated from my phone last night and I guess it didn't take? This app is the worst. Anyway, we've got a winner! Gonna PM and update again. We loved reading the funny stories, thanks so much for sharing everyone!  	1423575173.0
t3_2uguqo	1422841182.0	DavidShields	shroom	[Contest] I want to hear what makes you happy.	~~~ THIS CONTEST IS NOW OVER~~~  I said I'd pizza forward, and I am fulfilling that promise since I got my check last night. I will be giving away 2x $15 USD, 1 to each winner, giftcards to your choice of the big 3 (Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Papa John's).   I will leave this contest going until 8pm PST for the first winner and give away the second tomorrow at 5pm PST. I will not be choosing the winners per se, but rather reading entries and entering names into a random drawing from my Halloween candy cauldron. If you enter but do not win for the first drawing, I will leave your name in for the second.   The Contest:  I want to hear about 3 things that make you really, really happy. It could be a book, an action figure, a concert ticket stub, a certain time of day, person, animal... Anything, so long as it makes you happy, and it matters to you.   Furthermore, I want to see a picture of at least one of those things (close matches via pictures on the internet are acceptable, I know not everyone has a camera and I want to keep this accessible to as many people as possible).   The Rules:  * No bashing on anyone's entries. If you bash anyone's happiness I will remove your name and curse it with whatever I can.   * Entries over  3 paragraphs long will be disqualified. Generally try to keep your entry to a paragraph or two. I know that we all like to gush, but in the event that this becomes a heavily entered contest, I need to have time to read the entries!  * You can include more than one picture, but please share no more than 3 links unless you're going to make a quick gallery on imgur. The maximum picture allowance will be capped at 10 for time reasons.   * No NSFW pics. We all like to see parts of anatomy from time to time, but let's keep this PG please.   * No extreme language or graphic details os the NSFW variety. Same as the last rule, keep it generally PG please.   * No sob stories/stay on topic. We all have them, I get that. However this contest is not one of the emotional variety. I want this to be a positive experience for everyone.     That's pretty much it kids! Let's do this thing!  ___________________________________________________________________________  _EDIT 1_: Don't forget to include at least 1 picture guys! (Technically I didn't say it was required, so while I still prefer it, it's not a DQ for not having it there).  _Edit 2_: I forgot the I have a dinner to go to tomorrow night, so the deadline for the second drawing got moved to 5pm PST. Sorry about that!  Winner 1: Crack_the_nut!  Winner 2: Emilyeverafter!  _Final Edit_ Thanks everyone for entering. If I were a rich man, I'd giver everyone pizza, but I am a broke college student, so two is all I have in me for now. I hope that I can do this again sometime. You were all great and I hope that you have a great day and manage to get pizza from someone!	1422925288.0

t3_2t7knl	1421873062.0	Jimothy_Riggins	pizza	[Contest] [US Only] $25 Domino's e-gift card goes to the person with the worst, lamest, or pathetic excuse for needing a pizza. Winner will be announced at 7pm Central.	**EDIT:** This was more fun than I anticipated. There are a lot of lame people out there with terrible reasons to deserve a free pizza. I was also cursed out, threatened, and stalked. Yes, I am a Royals fan and yes [this](http://cdn2.sbnation.com/assets/3233953/fatguykc.gif) is me, your threats to announce it to the world won't sway me.  **AND THE WINNER IS /u/thekingearl, for being in too high of a tax bracket ever qualify for anything free.**  **Thanks again for playing, this was a blast. Keep an eye out, I'm thinking about doing this again.**  **EDIT 2:** Shout out to my new hype man, /u/jack_gray. He gets a consolation $10 e-gift card for literally commenting on all of my stuff.  There's certainly nothing wrong with being charitable, in fact, I encourage it. However, with this contest, I only want to hear pathetic, petty, and lame reasons that you deserve a pizza from me.  I'm giving away the pizza, so I get to be the judge. Upvotes will not determine my decision, but could influence. You have a bigger chance of winning if you make me laugh and/or your response is creative.  The contest ends at 7pm central and is an e-gift card from Domino's. When I declare the winner, you claim the prize by PMing me your email so I can send the card.  Admission to violent crimes, being racist, or a Yankees fan will disqualify you. I'm looking for a person with a bad excuse for needing pizza, not Satan.	1421888328.0

t3_2sk0lc	1421356025.0	amsoell	pizza	[Contest] Enjoy a delicious Papa John's pizza for me	I love pizza. I also love my wife, and she has roped me into this crazy [Whole 30](http://whole30.com) diet for the month. No grain. No cheese. No processed foods. In other words, no pizza.   It's not all bad, but I do miss digging into a delicious pie. I'm particularly craving some Papa John's which is weird because I'm not usually wild about theirs. But today is payday, and I'm looking for someone hungry for some Papa John's who can enjoy a pie for me.  So if you're in Papa John's delivery range (most of the US, right?) post what you like on your pizza. The comment with the most delicious-sounding pizza gets the pie.  EDIT: Oh man, I'm really regretting starting this post—all I can think about are these awesome sounding pizzas! I PM'ed the author who made me drool the most, but keep 'em coming in the event that The Papa doesn't deliver on their area. 	1421369043.0

t3_2q0z9f	1419213865.0	MCRAGEQUIT	pizza-gold	[Contest] One topping pie from Papa John's if you can guess my favorite Christmas song.	**CONTEST OVER:**  **Congrats to /u/Skim74 for ["Happy Xmas/War is Over" by John Lennon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXaLu7bvke8) and Congrats to /u/armedliberalinmo for ["Do they know it's Christmas" by BandAid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjQzJAKxTrE)**   **There ya go!  Now you know my two favorite Christmas songs.  Merry Christmas everyone!**  .   My husband spent all day putting up lights (better late than never!) and I finally got around to decorating my mantle and wrapping all the gifts for friends and family.  We were in no mood to cook, so I ordered a from Papa John's, but instead of paying directly, I bought a gift card to cover it and that gave me a code for a free one topping pizza.   I am fortunate to not need that code, so **I am giving it to the first person who guesses my favorite Christmas song.** I will be checking in from time to time and add hints if need be.    .   **UPDATE** I realized that I actually do have 2 favorite songs.  Congrats to /u/Skim74 who guessed *"Happy Christmas/War is Over" by John Lennon* which is the song I was referring to!  .  **Now, I do have a second favorite, which my husband reminded me of, so there is still a chance.  This song is a little embarrassing to admit that I like, but hopefully offering a pizza in return will cancel out the shame.  Same deal, guess the song, get a free one topping pizza from Papa John's.  Good luck!**  .  **Second song hint:** A lot of people make fun of it.  Actually, most of the time I hear people talk about it is to make fun of it or say something bad about it.   **One more hint:**  This song is newer than my first song, but not much newer.  	1419228217.0

t3_2lk8br	1415346385.0	Boodah93	pizza	[Contest] Lets have some fun, shall we??	Okay first off a little about me; I'm 26 years old, worked as a corrections officer since I was 19 made it to a Lieutenant then left, now currently working in Asset Protection. Long story short I've always worked in professions where myself and my fellow officers are commonly mis construed as assholes or pigs or that we are heartless bastards etc. But outside of work I'm just a regular that likes to have a good time. Now onto the contest.   In the spirit of helping further the notion that not all guys or ladies in law enforcement are assholes, I would like to have a mini scavenger hunt where the winner will be gifted with a pizza!! The rules are simple.  1. Pizza must come from a pizza place that will take online orders so I can place the order( dominos, Pizza Hut. Papa johns etc). As long as I can place the order online with my info it can be any pizza place.   2. Hunt starts as soon as I post this and ends November 8th 2014 at 3pm CST. There will be two winners. The first person to complete all tasks will get a small pizza and a drink of their choice. The grand prize winner is a large pizza of their choosing and a 2ltr drink. The person that wins the grand prize will be selected after the hunt ends. The Grand Prize will be the person whose entry has the most upvotes if it is a tie I will select the one that had the funniest salt and pepper picture and the funniest joke written. Also just a heads up, One of the 4 items will be taking a picture with a cop if you would prefer your face isn't shown then pm me and I'll blur it out before posting it in this thread or you can blur it out before posting public ally as long as i can prove it is you.  See very little rules, short sweet and to the point. Now let's see the items that will be needed for the hunt shall we!!!  1. Take a picture with a cop. The cop can be anywhere in the picture as long as you are in it also. Truthfully the cop doesn't even have to know that he is having his picture taken lol. Have fun with it!!  2. Take a picture of a salt and a pepper shaker where it looks like the salt and pepper shaker are engaging in a "sexual" activity, this is so the world can finally see how Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper had baby paprika on Blues Clues(yes it's lame but idk it made me giggle when I thought of it lol). Get creative if you wanna draw a face on the shakers or whatever do whatever you think will be the funniest!  3. Paper with an actual leaf from a tree(any leaf) on the paper, with the current date and the time of which you are making your post, and a joke and your favorite kind of pizza written on the paper beside the leaf.  4. A receipt for 37 cents worth of gas.    Well there ya'll have it. I think it is a very simple scavenger hunt contest!

US Only!	**CLOSED Winners are: [idkman420 and tank1805](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2kvu2o/contest_papa_johns_in_your_mouth_us_only/clpiiu1)**  Lets get our halloween on up in here! What's at stake? A pizza from Papa Johns and hell, I'll even throw in for breadsticks! That's right, Pizza AND breadsticks!!!  What's the rules?   1. No sob stories. You tell me a sob story, you are disqualified, This contest is sob free. What I want, is you telling me what you would do for the pizza. Kinda along the lines of "what would you do for a klondike bar". The more outlandish and spectacular the better. Give us something good to read! Keep it PG 13 please. 2. Must have been active on reddit as per rules one on the side bar. I'll be checking.  3. Damn, it's hard making up rules for a pizza contest. Wow.  4. You have to be comfortable with giving me  your address & phone number so that I can order the pizza.  5. Yeah, I think I ran out of ru- Nope! This contest ends at 2pm CST. So that I can ensure that pizza can be doled out in an appropriate amount of time.   SO ALLONS-Y as my third favourite doctor says and get cracking, the safety of your stomach is at risk here!!	1414790552.0
t3_2knhdn	1414563084.0	turbo240	pizza-purple	[Contest] Best House of Cards gets sweet, sweet pizza!	Feelin' froggy and generous. Fuck your sob story, life is hard, deal with it.  So, I dunno, make a House of Cards. Ever done it? Harder than it seems. Best I've been able to do is a simple three level triangular structure. So, get creative, and have a steady hand. Bonus points for use of a Nudie Deck. No cheating, you dicks. Glue, tape, staples, use of the force, etc; all cheating.  Post imgur links to your pictures, along with a handwritten card with your username and the date in the pic. Best one wins. We'll say till...Friday, 10/31. Good Luck!  **EDIT:** Really people? You people come to this sub, beg and plead for free pizza, and then all you have to *build* *a* *house* *of* *cards* to get it, and only **2** people respond?! Guess all these sob stories really are bullshit. I'm speechless.   **Final** **Edit**: /u/SamuraiDDD wins, and with a personal note, I am utterly shocked by the lack of participation. This easy contest proves that you sorry sad sacks are full of shit, if any of you really needed food you would *at* *least* submitted *something* because the winner's submission was so small it can barely be considered a house. As such I've **doubled** the prize to **$50** worth of pizza. Fuck you all!	1414822331.0

t3_2fz4jm	1410321430.0	AlkyIHalide	pizza	[Contest] Pizza for a randomly chosen MBTI type	Here is how this will work: I have made a [pie chart](http://imgur.com/aVKmxGI) based on the data from [this site](http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/my-mbti-results/how-frequent-is-my-type.htm). The pie chart will be printed out and taped over a dart board. Since I have terrible aim throwing darts, it may as well end up almost anywhere. Because multiple people may have the same personality type, I will then collect the usernames of all the people who have the selected personality type and throw it in a RNG to pick the winner of a fine pizza. The contest is open from Wednesday 12am to Friday 12am in EST.  If you don't know what MBTI is or haven't taken a test, this is a test for it: http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp  Details: 1) If you win, you must use the [verification system](http://rikbrown.co.uk/rop/) or I will pick another person.  2) I understand that population frequency of a certain type skews a type in favor. So this has been adjusted accordingly. 3) The winner gets a maximum of $25USD for pizza. 4) If I PM the winner, please get back to me within a day. 5) For entry, just post your MBTI!  I don't want to limit it strictly to the US. Perhaps if it is allowed, I can use an honor system to send money to the winner via Paypal where he/she can post a picture of the pizza. Have fun!  **Edit:**The contest is closed. Thanks for playing guys. Here's some data on the people who posted: ISTJ-7.2% ISFJ-8.4% INFJ-9.6% INTJ-20.5% ISTP-8.4% ISFP-7.2% INFP-10.8% INTP-6.0% ESTP-0% ESFP-1.2% ENFP-4.8% ENTP-3.6% ESTJ-2.4% ESFJ-3.6% ENFJ-3.6% ENTJ-2.4%  Conclusion: INTJ's are attracted to pizza. ESTP's are out at a party somewhere wondering who will order the pizza.  And of course: my dart ended up picking **ENTJ**. There were only two ENTJ's who posted. So I decided a coin flip between /u/PelorTheBurningHate and /u/cb_. It appears /u/cb_ won! Thanks again for posting everyone!	1410496570.0
t3_2fwf3t	1410264779.0	VelocityRD	pizza	[Contest] I turn 26 today and feel like giving more than receiving, so here's your chance to win yourself some pizza!	**EDIT 2 (9/10/2014, 8:40AM):** Last night, after several readings of the page, I whittled my entries down to the winners. Yeah, winner**s**. I planned on doing this all along, but decided to keep it a little secret until I awarded the two prizes. I actually gave away *two* $26 gift cards last night: to /u/Eroy and /u/creativexangst, for their great gift stories ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2fwf3t/contest_i_turn_26_today_and_feel_like_giving_more/ckdr7ur) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2fwf3t/contest_i_turn_26_today_and_feel_like_giving_more/ckdhzbx)). Thank you all for entering -- this was great fun!  **Note: This will be the first time I've given through RAoP, so bear with me.**  Today (September 9) is my birthday! I'm now in the upper half of my 20s, which according to the girl I'm dating means I'm officially a [crotchety old man.](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/2126096/grumpy-clint-eastwood-o.gif) *So, uh, get off my lawn or something.*  To celebrate, I'm going to give away **$26 worth of pizza goodness to [the pizza chain of your choice]**! What does that mean?  * If you prefer one of the Big Three, it'll mean an online gift card! * If it's not one of the Big Three (e.g., your favorite local joint), you'll have to keep the order total to $26 (delivery fee not included).  I'm offering that second option because when it comes to food and dining out, I really enjoy finding and trying local places instead of the typical chain offerings. One of my favorite pizza places was actually a small, one-store place in my hometown, called The Barn. (It actually looks like a barn, too. Sadly, no cows were on premises -- they'd milked their fame and [acted like this](http://33.media.tumblr.com/d2ab949e1bddad229149b2d9dc13ff66/tumblr_m96lls57wz1qdlh1io1_r1_400.gif) all the time.  *"Okay, okay, we don't care, how do we win this contest?" -- you, probably*  *sigh* Fiiiine, I'll get to the rules. Party pooper.  1. United States only. [(Sorry, Canada.)](http://ioneglobalgrind.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/41806-emma-stone-are-you-crying-gif-71rm.gif?w=600&h=335) 2. You have to be following the rules to the subreddit. Yes, those, over there. ----> 3. If you win, **you must verify with the verification system under [subreddit Rule 4](http://verify.randomactsofpizza.com/).** If you don't, I'll have no choice but to move to the next-best entry! 4. Once I decide the winner (at or around **5pm EDT today**), you'll have **one hour** to respond to my PM before I move to the next-best entry. (*"But why one hour? That's so not cool, what if I'm doing something between 5-6pm?!"* Hey, if you're jonesing for pizza today/tonight, it'd be nice to be able to get it for dinner, y'know?) 5. After I PM the winner and get verification, we'll go over the necessary information for getting your award to you. 6. **Only top-level replies to this post will count as entries.** Replies to top-level posts won't be considered. Feel free to comment on others' entries, but please, no vote brigading! 7. To enter, answer the following question: **What is the *best* birthday present you have ever received?** It can be because of monetary value, sentimental value, its coincidence with a significant life event, whatever -- just tell me *why* it was the best! **(Wanna make your entry even better? Show proof of the gift!)**  Remember, the winner will be chosen based on my [totally never wrong](http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Yeah-Sure-Okay.gif) personal opinion, so make your entry a good one! Really sit down and give it a good think.	1410352910.0

You can make  an "okay" joke because of August-us Waters (The Fault in our Stars).   You can make a seasonal joke about August.   Anything related to August is fair game, though if I can't see the link between the joke and August, I might ask you to add a source or explanation.

t3_2afoi9	1405094993.0	KunSeii	FAP	[Contest] Buffalo, Booze, and Buddies (NJ)	Hey everyone. I'm sure anyone who is here would agree with me that there are few pleasure in life greater than kicking back with a few friends and enjoying a slice with a couple cold ones.  Some of the best times of my life have been had over pizza, and that continues to this day. I always tell people that one of the things I love about my job is that, by coincidence, my dad works right down the street, so we get to have lunch together every day.  We've been going to the same pizza place for years, and early on we discovered they have the best buffalo chicken pizza on the planet. I've taken friends there, and every one has agreed with me.  Hell, I've thrown parties and driven from Mahwah to Whippany to get pizza for it.  This is such a great place, and I've decided I want to give back, and here's how:  I will hand deliver (Yes that's right. To increase the potential eligible participants) the following to 1 lucky winner:  -One Large Pie of the best Buffalo Chicken Pizza in the world.   -One 6 pack of beer (Your choice or I will surprise you) If winner is over 21.   Eligibility Requirements:   **-Live within driving distance**  My daily commute takes me up and down 287. If you live between exits 39 and 59 or close enough, then you're probably within distance. I'm not trying to shut people out, but I doubt anyone will want pizza that arrives several hours later and cold. PM me if you want me to let you know if you're close enough.  **-Have an account older than 60 days**  **-Be active on a sub other than a RA sub**  **-Be prepared to show ID if you want the beer**  **-Be available on the date to receive the pizza**  If you fit the criteria, post whether you prefer blue cheese or ranch on your buffalo chicken pizza, and tell me your best story involving pizza with your buddies.  One random winner will be chosen at midnight EST on Thursday, July 17th. The pizza will arrive Friday, July 18th around or after 6 pm EST.  Best of luck!  P.S. Delivery date is not set in stone. If you will be out of town that day and you win, just let me know. We'll work out another day.  **UPDATE:** I spoke with the owner today, and they do have gift certificates.  So I'm prepared to offer two alternatives for those who might live too far for the delivery.  1. I will give you a gift certificate good for one buffalo chicken pizza. Pick it up whenever you can get there.  2. I will meet you at the pizza place myself where I will buy the pie for your group (lunch or dinner) and pick up the six after.  After speaking with the mods, I'm going to be keeping the name of the pizza place secret until a winner is selected, however I will say that it's in Morris county, Whippany area, within 5 miles of Rt. 10.  **UPDATE 2:** Winner chosen!   http://i.imgur.com/hGbG4KB.jpg  Congratulations to /u/squigi on winning this contest.  You've earned yourself a six pack of beer (provided you're over 21) and a large Buffalo Chicken from Pronto Pizza in Cedar Knolls (Formerly Ridgedale Pizza) PM me your details along with which of the three options you would most prefer.	1405659841.0

I'm going to watch the documentary on jodorowsky's unfinished dune. The only jodorowsky movie I've never seen, by the way.   I wanted to end on a positive note but Damn, people, when I say I've seen every movie and ask for something old or foreign, and you recommend the top movie from IMDB or every big budget release of the past 6 months, I worry about you!	1402270154.0
t3_27k33n	1402159767.0	i_ll_do_one	pizza	[Contest] Triple crown Trifecta (pizza) box	**Update:**  Well dang, ***another*** Triple Crown missed.  Really thought California Chrome had it.  Looks like the upset really messed with any chance for Trifectas, so I'm going to award the pizza to the only correct exacta (top two horses) in the sumbissions, /u/bubblegumtrees.  Please PM me for the pizza of your choice.  ***Contest closed, see ya next year folks.***  In a few short hours the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes will see California Chrome try to be the first Triple Crown winner in 35 years.  Could Wicked Strong play spoiler?  You tell me.  A trifecta box in horse racing is a box bet picking the top three horses (in any order).  Put down your picks by ~~5:30~~ 6:15 PM, and when I get back from the tracks tonight/tomorrow morning I will provide the first person with the correct trifecta with the large pizza of his/her choice tonight or tomorrow (U.S. please).  If California Chrome indeed picks up the triple crown I'll send out up to three individuals for the correct Trifectas, assuming there are that many.  * California Chrome * Wicked Strong * Ride On Curlin * Commanding Curve * Tonalist * Medal Count * Samraat * General A Rod * Commissioner * Matterhorn * Matuszak  Pick 3, and obviously no edits please.  Affirmed is about to go down.  Edit: post time a bit later than what I remember to be.  A bit more time to place your bets folks.	1402189418.0

t3_23s7lu	1398274375.0	Caulkpunch	pizza	[Contest] I need some custom photo-shopping done, and am willing to pay in pizza for the best one	Hi. I'm taking an English class at my community college, had to write a persuasive paper on an open topic. Naturally, I chose the destruction of the 2nd Death Star in ROTJ and it's lack of moral justification. Theme of my paper is comparison of the Rebel Alliance's tactics to modern day terrorism. All pretty straightforward so far, right?   Here's where you come in... I also have to do an oral report on my paper, which must include a visual aid. I'm working up a power point, but I can't find any existing images of the Rebel Alliance dressed as terrorists. I also don't know shit about photoshop, so I need someone to make this for me. However, I don't expect anything for free, so I'm going to buy a pizza for the best image of the ROTJ Rebels dressed like Al-Qaeda.  Feel free to post links to your images in comments, or pm them to me if you prefer.  Rules: Images must be received by 9:00am PST Sunday the 27th. I will announce winner and send that person a $20 gift card to any of the "Big 3" pizza chains on Monday morning. Thanks!

t3_21ngmg	1396067652.0	capt_badass	pizza	[Contest] Tell me a story about making it through a big change in life	20$ e-gift card to whichever post I pick.  So here's some background - I quit a decent job with a good career path on my 25th birthday to move for a very high paying job with not many future prospects, but the chance to live and work internationally.  This was about 8 months ago.  Yesterday, I put in a resignation letter.  I do not fit in with the work culture of my current company, even though I love the expat lifestyle it's not good enough.  It's a good thing for me, really, I've weighed the options and made pros/cons lists, the whole nine yards.  I've already got a job lined back up in the US, in the city with my SO.  But, it's still a huge change and I'd love to hear some stories about the BIG CHANGES you've made in life, and the consequences (good or bad).  I'll close the contest at around midnight CST tomorrow.  EDIT - Contest closed.  I've PM'd the winner.	1396155582.0

t3_1xx5ce	1392405274.0	Swedish_Chef_Bork_x3	pizza	[Contest] Happy Valentine's Dough!	Many couples send flowers to each other's work places on Valentine's Day, but I'm not really a flower-type person. Mostly because I'm a dude. Earlier today I got a text from my fiancee telling me not to go anywhere for lunch, then a pizza guy showed up to my office! Turns out she ordered it for me, which is really awesome because I was going to get pizza for lunch anyway. The dude actually walked in at the same time as someone else delivering flowers from a SO, it was pretty funny.  I want to give my fiancee some kind of surprise tonight, but I don't know what. We aren't really the type of couple to do anything fancy, so we don't have reservations at a nice restaurant or anything like that. I'll be home from work in about 2 hours and she'll be over at my house maybe an hour and a half after that. I'll send one pizza to whoever comes up with the best thing I can do for her, given that I only have about a 1-1.5 hour window to prepare. Let's hear some ideas!

Offer is here in America, but in the spirit of the Olympics, I'm going to do my best to include people from all parts of the globe!	/edit - So many awesome stories and memories...it was hard to chose a winner, but /u/trickedoutdavid wins! Thanks everyone for sharing these incredible stories :)   I'm going to be really honest with you folks. I am...not super patriotic. As a matter of fact, I don't really understand patriotism. That is...until it's Olympic time. And then I turn into a crazy patriot. It's so weird. But these athletes from all over the world inspire me so much. I can't imagine what it must be like to dedicate your entire life to something, and then have that moment in which you realize *you are the best in entire world at what you do at that moment*.   So, in honor of the Olympics, I want you to tell me your favorite Olympic moment. Bonus points if you include video! I love rewatching this stuff! Tell me why it was your favorite! I'll pick one or two people come Monday for a giftcard!   I'm really happy to include the entire WORLD in this contest, but if someone from outside the US wins, I'll need you to be patient with me while I figure out how to get a GC to you, ok? Also, since it's a bit more expensive, I might have to get it to you next weekend (I wait tables).   Can't wait to hear what everyone comes up with!  A few other things to note:  -If you've won a contest or been gifted a pizza in the past couple of weeks, please don't enter. Let's spread that cheesy goodness around!  And I know this is going to sound petty as hell, butttt   - If you've won a pizza at any time *and didn't make a thank you post to whoever bought you the pizza*, please don't enter here. There have been SO many requests filled lately by kind people, and I mean, MAYBE one or two thank you posts a day. That's ludicrous. So yeah. If that's you, don't bother.   - Finally, be prepared to do the verification thing. And please have an account older than three months, and please have posted in other subs besides this one (or the other random acts subs).   Thanks again everyone!! :D	1392075126.0

Thanks to EVERYONE for participating in this. I enjoyed my warm welcome back to this sub. I look forward to future fun. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ **EDIT:** About 3 hours left! I want more to participate. So, if you're someone who isn't watching the game but wants some 'za, tell me why you're not watching the game and show me a pic of what you're doing instead. Can't take a pic? DRAW A PICTURE! This will still be a random contest, but I will only include names of those joining in on the fun. GOOD LUCK!  **EDIT 2:** Thanks to everyone participating. My day has taken me on a little adventure, so I won't be able to give away pizza for another hour or so. Sorry about this, but I promise pizza will be coming soon.   **EDIT 3:** Just made it home in time for kickoff. Winner announcement very soon!   **EDIT 4:** WINNER HAS BEEN CHOSEN! Waiting for verification and I will keep you all posted. Sorry it took so long. My laptop decided to not work for some random reason... ______________________________________________________________________________________________  For my first contribution to this thread, I would like to give away some 'za on the biggest junk food eating day of the year, the **SUPER BOWL!**  **Let's make this a contest:**  If you're planning on watching the big game, post a picture of your set-up. By this, I mean your TV, favorite chair, beer, etc... Show me how you plan to enjoy the game. With that post, include which of the big three chains you prefer and who you're rooting for in the game.  **THAT'S IT!**  Now, I do have a catch and this will only succeed through an honest winner... If you're my lucky (random) winner, I would like you to post another picture of you enjoying the pizza with the game on in the background.  I hope this all goes well. I have faith in this community and I know a lot of good has come from it. Let's make this a fun Super Bowl Sunday. If my experience goes well, I was thinking of returning to give away more on my upcoming cake day... So you can see that as an opportunity for the future.  As I said, I'm new to this. I had a brief negative encounter in the past and I feel now is the time to try this again. I've never received, but I'd love to give one away and make someone happy while they watch football (but mostly the commercials/Puppy Bowl).  I will pick my winner by **5PM EST**. That should give enough time to get some delivery before the game starts. If you have any questions or comments, please post them. As I said (three times now... ?), I'm new to this. Anything anyone has to help me out in making this a more magical and successful contest, let me know! It's bed time now. Good luck to you all. I look forward to your entries!   **SHOW ME THOSE LIVING ROOMS!!!**	1391387743.0
t3_1wputr	1391246118.0	capt_badass	pizza	[Contest] Pizza for travelers	Alright team - I'm trying to come up with a good idea for a week long trip to take with my SO.  We're planning on something at the beginning of March while she is on Spring Break.  The interesting caveat is that we both live literally across the world from one another, and I'm trying to think of a good place to meet that doesn't require one of us to fly 30+ hours to where the other one is living.  I'm in SE Asia, and she is in Texas.  That said - show me your favorite travel photo and share some kind of story.  I don't really care where it is, whether it is the Grand Canyon or Lake Baikal.  Which ever photo/story combo is my favorite after 24ish hours will win a 25$ gift card to one of the big three, or if you have a local pizza chain where I can order online, I'm open to that as well.  Contest will be closed ~4 AM EST tomorrow (2/2/14) morning.  Messaged the winner, thanks guys for the awesome entries.	1391346732.0

Or, if you don't play games, what is something on Netflix you believe I should absolutely watch?	/edit - /u/hungrydyke is the winner! Thanks everyone for the awesome suggestions! Y'all are pretty freakin rad :D   Hey there RAoP! It's been awhile, and I have some extra money to spare, so I thought I would have another contest! The rules are pretty simple...I just want to know what your favorite ps3 game is, and why you think I should absolutely check it out. I finally bought one for myself over Christmas, and I absolutely love it, and I've had the best time checking out new games. Especially indie ones for some reason (seriously...*Limbo* and especially *rain* are two of the most gorgeous, poignant, and fantastic games I've ever played). In case anyone is wondering, my favorite game is *The Last of Us*, and I'm also a huge fan of the *Bioshock* series.   And for those of you who may not play games, Feel free to tell me about stuff I should check out on Netflix! I'm always up for checking out new movies and TV shows :D  I'll pick a winner sometime tomorrow, and you're all competing for a $15 GC to your choice of the big 3! So good luck everyone...can't wait to hear all your awesome suggestions!   OH! I forgot to mention that the winner will have to use the verification system. I hate doing that, but it seems like there's been a lot of scamming happening lately, and that makes me sad. So yeah. Better safe than sorry and all that. 	1390181812.0

EDIT #3: We have 1 winner /u/Panic_Panda- Congrats!  We will still check back @ 5pm EST to see if there are any other cool submissions we deem worthy of some pizza love.   EDIT #2: We have not yet found a winner but would like to give away a pizza. Rules are a sketch of one of the photos... not photoshop. We think the best thing to do would be to again push out the deadline for contest submissions. **We will pick a winner (or maybe 2) at 5pm EST tomorrow (Sun 11/10/13).** Although the photoshopped ones are damn funny, we would like to stick to the rules we initially set up for the contest.       EDIT #1: This is /u/purplefartmonkey on behalf of /u/novaguy28 - We will be extending the to 11pm EST... he fell asleep after dinner and I don't feel right deciding without him. There are some *awesome* submissions so please keep them coming.   It has been some time since we have held a contest. A move to a new state, looking for jobs and the such will do that. Now that we are back we have a new contest.  We are including three pictures we have taken at random times. We thought it would be fun if you could re-sketch one of our photos or maybe add one of your own design in our likeness. My wife enjoys flowers, monkeys & gem mining, myself poker and the Redskins. This is something we could enjoy looking at for years to come, so please let your creative juices flow!  We will announce a winner(s) this evening - let's say the cutoff for submissions is 8pm EST.

t3_1pn1ad	1383250527.0	sun-eyed_girl	PIF	[Contest] Show me your awesome Halloween costume!	Happy Halloween, fellow redditors! Today is my monthly payday, and I'm finally in a financial situation where I can offer some delicious pizza (I won a contest ~1 year ago, shortly after finding out about this sub, and want to pay it forward).  Since I'm a grad student whose friends mostly live in other cities, I won't be doing anything to celebrate this evening. That's why I want to see your costumes, and even your candy haul if applicable. Share the joy with me!  There are several rules involved with this contest (if you don't like them, just move on...poster chooses rules!), so please don't waste your time applying if your submission won't fit the following criteria:  1. You must be an ACTIVE redditor, no exceptions. I don't care if you have the coolest costume I've ever seen; if you only use your account to ask for pizza, you won't be considered.  2. In the same vein, I will not be considering submissions from folks who have recently requested on this sub, or related subs. I'm not trying to be a meanie, but I want this to be a FUN pizza party rather than a subsistence pizza 'party.'   3. The goods must be shared with at least one human friend if you win.  4. Your costume must be homemade (no bagged costumes, please!) and either creative, funny, clever, intricate, or otherwise unique.  5. Your costume must actually be yours - take a photo with today's date and your handle as proof.  6. A winner will be chosen at 10 p.m. EDT, to give all U.S. folks some time to participate. U.S. submissions only, please.  7. The prize is a $20 certificate to your choice of the Big 3.   Now have some fun, and show me what you've got!

t3_1o54a7	1381411121.0	themystif		[contest] I need a logo for an Etsy business that my girlfriend and I are trying to start. Can you make a tree?	Cause I can't.  I'm looking for a logo I can use for the page, business cards, and small icons, as icons for google pages, facebook pages, whatever we might try.  We're naming the store Emerywood, so I wanted a kind of simple tree. This **[here](http://imgur.com/pBjrQ1V)**^link looks like something I'd want, but I don't want to violate any copyrights. I really like the split tree thing going on there, and the fact that it is one color, so it's simple to print.  I'll give a gift card of $30 to whatever is your preferred pizza place (As long as I can make an online giftcard to that store) to whoever I choose as the best logo. Feel free to ask any questions about anything. I'll give the gift to the best one, if I actually end up using it or not, as long as it's an acceptable logo. **Edit:** United States Contest. I will choose a winner on Monday Oct. 14th, by 12pm EST  EDIT: **Winner decided.** Contacting... **EDIT:** Sent $30 to /u/JustSayingMan!

t3_1o34j3	1381347507.0	BlackLeatherRain	FAP	[CONTEST] I need a fancy Craigslist ad. Do you know HTML?	I need a fancy Craigslist ad to promote a photography business.  It will need tables, space at the top for the company logo graphic, and a way to show a gallery of 5-6 pictures without relying on the Craigslist photo system (which is suckage, by the way).  Essentially, I'm looking for a flyer, but the free flyer websites all use CSS and I'm just not talented enough to translate their code into what I want.  I speak (to a degree) HTML, but not yet CSS.  Will keep the contest open through the weekend to give any hungry amateurs a chance to throw this together.  Most spiffy/professional design (as agreed upon by myself and the photographer) gets a GC to either one of the big three OR to any delivery place local to you that allows for e-GCs.

It's the first one to guess, not the guess with the highest point level.**  Okay, one a little less conventional for this one. I'll provide edits with clues after so long without the correct answer. A $25 gift goes to the lucky redditor who can guess one of my two favorite Pokemon, and a $10 order to the 2nd Pokemon. Please only 2 guesses per person until a clue update comes.   * Clue number 1: both are from the 2nd generation of Pokemon. (Gold/Silver/Crystal era) * Clue number 2: one is primarily dark in type * Clue number 3: Both are stage 1 evolutions, and do not have a stage 2 (I.e. Charmander is basic, Charmeleon is stage 1, Charizard is stage 2) * Clue number4: One's shiny form completely makes it green  Also, the first one has been guessed!

I would like to offer a $15 giftcard to whoever can make me feel like a horrible person for enjoying the blessed life I have been given.

I'll be back about this time tomorrow to select a winner so you have pizza for the weekend.  Edit: Thank you, everyone for submitting your stories. The whole spectrum of stories showed up and I decided to award two winners, RaoulDuke209 and Quickee_ss. I'll update again once I've sent out the pizzas.

I don't know how to describe it. But something like the above. (*Contemporary*, mind! Nothing before 1990.)

t3_1l4298	1377519096.0	jackelfrink	pizza	[Contest] Saturday Aug 31 is International Bacon Day. Bacon themed contest with $80 in total prizes	**UPDATE** *Contest over. Unfortunately I dont feel I can award any prizes at all. Only one person posted a pic at all and that pic did not have any real actual bacon in it of any of the requested forms. Only photoshoped inserts.*  You may enter by posting a time-stamped pic with one or more of the following in it.  * Bacon  * Wearing an article of clothing with bacon on it  * Holding a book by Francis Bacon  * Holding a film staring Kevin Bacon  * Standing in front of a street sign of Bacon Rd, Bacon street, bacon lane, etc  The pic does not have to contain every one of them to win. Bonus points will be awarded for creativity and originality. (Flatliners on laser-disc and three other items would be more points than X-Men: First Class on DVD and all four other items.)  The entry has to be one picture. But if things are blurry and out of focus you can post close up shots to follow up. No fair posting five pics all posted at different times and locations each showing a different item.  The pic must be *OF* you. And time-stamped with your username.  If you come up with some sixth bacon related thing to include in the pic, thats bonus points too. Again, I will reward creativity.  $50 first place and three $10 runner ups get eCards to their choice of the big three. I will decide winners sometime the morning of Saturday Aug 31.  Its my contest so I am permited to be a dick if I want to. I can disqualify anyone I want for any reason I want.	1377956051.0

Thanks to everyone for their entries, I really enjoyed seeing them!** Hey there RAOP-ers! My name is Benjamin and I'm the Community Manager for [Gamepedia.com](http://www.gamepedia.com), the world's largest host for video game wikis! Among the 250+ wikis we host are [Minecraft Wiki](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki) and [Terraria Wiki](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Terraria_Wiki), some of the largest and most complete gaming wikis in existence!  Wikis are all about community and cooperation, and in that spirit we have decided to give away all kinds of awesome goodies to our users. We're in the process of getting a system set up on our site where we're going to give away a pizza a week for an entire year, but we just couldn't stand to wait until our developers finished that system to get started!  **In order to enter this contest, we're asking that people submit some kind of photo that relates to one of the many, many games that we have wikis for** (for a list, [check here](http://www.gamepedia.com/wikis)). It can be of you wearing a shirt or with a figurine, or even just simply of your copy of the game, a screenshot, WHATEVER!   I'll assign a number to each entry, and tomorrow (8/22) at 3pm Central I will use an RNG to pick the winner, who will receive a $20 card to their choice of a national US chain.  *Our lawyers insist that I tell everyone a couple things, so forgive me for this. This contest is open to US residents ages 13 and over. The winner will have to fill out and return a short form verifying eligibility before we can transmit your prize. Its a pain, I know, but I couldn't convince them to let me off the hook this time. You will be able to submit the form via fax or e-mailing a photo of it to us.*  PS: Everyone is eligible to register for [our free t-shirt giveaway](http://www.gamepedia.com/sweeps/gamepedia-t-shirt-giveaway), one winner each week for the next year!

t3_1kmbv7	1376853880.0	IronTek	pizza	[Contest] $25 Gift Card - Photographic proof that your username best fits you.	Just like the title says, I'll give out a $25 eGift card (so I guess that's Dominos, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns -- USA only, sorry) to whomever can produce photographic evidence (of whatever person/place/thing is appropriate) with the date and your username present in the photo, showing the RAoP community why your username was the perfect choice for you.  So, for an original example, a random user /u/catlady12 could produce a photo with her username on paper and 12 cats in it.  That might very well win.  But creativity will count, no doubt!  Speaking of cats and users, given the nature of the contest, /u/I_RAPE_CATS is specifically ineligible from competing in this contest!  The winner will be decided by some combination of upvotes and which one I like best (in the event of an upvote tie or if I suspect some vote manipulation occurred, to provide two examples of when upvotes won't be enough).  Contest ends at 8:00pm Eastern time tomorrow (Monday, August 19, 2013).  Also, the winner will still go through the verification system.  Update: Okay, so I guess I didn't check in on this until 9:45pm EDT.  And DaveLinger and ShreddyNeddy are tied with 11 upvotes each.  We will no go into sudden death overtime where each will choose a number between 1 and 10,000.  I will then go generate a random number at [random.org](http://www.random.org).  Closest to the number wins.  PMs going out to both with these instructions.  Update 2: Notices went out, and my random number was generated ahead of time and sent to the mods, so I can't be accused of playing favorites.  Final: My number was 8997.  /u/ShreddyNeddy wins!  Congrats!  Thanks everyone for playing!	1376999522.0

t3_1jyjtf	1375974855.0	thoughtyousaidweest	FAP	[Contest] Best long-distance gift idea earns a $20 e-gift card for one of the big three (US only)!	Edit 5: Alright, the winner has been contacted! If I don't hear from them within 24 hours, the second place poster will be contacted. Thanks so much for all of your submissions! I'm so excited to send my bf his gifts :)  Final Edit: /u/blarglznoflo is officially the winner!! Thanks again for playing. Hope you all get your pizzas soon!  ------------------------------------  Edit 3: Just a reminder that I haven't abandoned this contest! Winner will be chosen TONIGHT at 9pm eastern. If you have an idea that hasn't been listed in the comments, there's still time to submit!  Edit 4: Alright, haven't had much activity since I first posted so winner is tentatively chosen. I say this because I have a feeling I won't have internet access right at 9pm. But know that one of you won and I'm going to be messaging you ASAP!  ------------------------------------  Alright, so here's the deal. My long-distance boyfriend celebrated his first birthday by himself at his brand new job and was sad to hear from basically no one. So I've decided to turn this birthday around for him by sending him 31 days of gifts - who says you can't celebrate all month ;) - and hopefully when he looks back on this year, he'll have a happier memory to take away from it :)  That said, I am a grad student and my stipend is not phenomenal (but hey, it's money) so all of my gifts will have to be free/very cheap. I'd like as many to be physical gifts as possible, but online gifts could be okay too, depending on what they are. Please help me think of some ideas! The best one will get a $20 e-gift card. Contest ends this Sunday (8/11) at 9PM EST!  Here are some ideas I already have to give you guys a place to start:  * a coupon book with 23 coupons (one for each year)  * going to do my best to find him a Picard birthday card! all about that Star Trek lately * a parody of a song he likes with lyrics written for him (I've done this before. It's not as dumb as it sounds, lol I promise) * he asked me for [this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594746370/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) for his birthday. I had already gotten him something else, but since I'm doing this I figure I might as well send it to him for his 8/5 gift - gotta be the biggest one :) * a sexy Dropbox collection (keeping our LDR fun ;) ) * some origami, maybe like Yoda or something * a giant list of reasons why he's so wonderful  Excited to hear all of your ideas! Good luck!  Edit: formatting  Edit 2: Ahh you guys!! These ideas are so great!! I'm still in lab and haven't had time to respond to your comments, but seriously, thanks so much for all the help so far!! Even though there are tons of ideas here, I'm sticking to what I said and am leaving this open 'til Sunday, so please don't hesitate to submit between now and then if you think of something that hasn't been said yet!	1376332930.0

I will pick the winning story the morning of 8/15 based upon whichever story invokes the biggest emotional response. It could be happiness, laughter, sadness, rage, etc... I know, very subjective of me, but it's my vote... I'm a pretty unemotional/objective person most of the time, so this is me exercising my emotional side :D	1376668257.0

t3_1i8yav	1373763058.0	novaguy28	novaguy28	[Contest] Novaguy28 @ my wife PurpleFartmonkey Sunday contest---Details inside!	As some of you know, I got in trouble when I was young, paid my dues and have been on the straight and narrow for the last 20 years or so. Something that has always bothered me was the fact that after someone is released from prison, they are not given any tools to rebuild a life for themselves. I was fortunate and had a support system, but many do not. My wife and I created a sub call /r/ExCons and our hope is to provide a place where people can offer advice / support, suggest any community resources that may help, offers to help with resumes / job applications, links to articles, offer an old suit for someone to use for an interview... or just a place to vent. Our new sub is what we are basing today's contest on: We will deliver a large 5-topping pizza from Papa John's to any one in the US who gives us the best ideas, links, resources, offers... anything to help get our sub off the ground.You can either post on our sub or here in the contest. If you post on the sub please include a link so we can check it out!  Our focus is to help people who made a mistake, paid their dues and need support rebuilding a positive life for themselves... so for contest purposes ~ the sky is the limit! We will leave the contest open until 3 pm EST so someone will be able to have dinner on us. US only (sorry) & no PMs for this contest will be acknowledged. This cause is very dear to my heart.

Totally jumping on the one-man bandwagon that /u/plastic_apollo started, but I thought it was a fun idea to get some photoshop in return for pizza. I've had this [picture of my dog] (http://i.imgur.com/cKRYnCW.jpg) for a while and was just wondering what kind of hijinks reddit could get him into. Preferably something spider-man related since that's his costume, but no specifics other than that. The image itself can be modified or he can be put into some other image, be creative!  About 5:20 EST here so give it about 24 hours to call a winner. Will send a $20 e-gift card for Papa John's, Domino's, or Pizza Hut.  Edit 1: To add to the exposure, I x-posted this in /r/picrequests and /r/photoshopbattles, so I will count entries from there as well.

t3_1f1apz	1369500474.0	relinquospes	pizza	[Contest] Name my kitten.	I have been lurking here for some months and haven't requested or contributed anything.  I cannot be a giftee because there are no chain pizza places who will deliver to me, but there is another way you guys can help me.  My boyfriend and I have a sort of exotic pet zoo going on in our house, and I'm honestly sick of coming up with names for all of them.  Right now I have tons of nameless tarantulas, snakes, monitors, and various other little critters.  My one and only cat got pregnant days before her appointment to be spayed, and my boyfriend has decided to keep one of the kittens because she likes his shoe.  So she needs a name but there's a catch, all furry animals in this house are named after a food item (her mother's name is Sandwich).  Whomever comes up with the most clever food-based name will receive a $20 gift card to the chain pizza place of their choosing.  Bonus points for ironic names for my spiders or dragon names for my reptiles.  Offer ends at 7 pm EST.  [Picture of kitten](http://i.imgur.com/U6xTPGQ.jpg)  EDIT:  Since my boyfriend is the one who decided to keep the kitten, he is taking on full responsibility for her and therefore he gets to choose the name.  I see a lot of names here I love, but the final decision is his and there's one here he likes a lot.  But there's still another hour and a half so keep 'em coming!!  EDIT 2:  Just for clarification, this kitten is a FEMALE.  EDIT 3:  CONTEST OVER!  Boyfriend is currently picking the name and I'll announce the winner very shortly.  FINAL EDIT!!:  The boyfriend has picked a winner: Chalupa submitted by /u/Steamy-Nicks.  I have also decided to give a $10 gift card to /u/_justforyou for the spider name "Arachnus Deathicus", which will now be the name of my Goliath Bird Eater.	1369524684.0
t3_1d6qvq	1367019785.0	Blackmere	pizza	[Contest] Help me order dinner.	**EDIT 2: The Winners**  I picked Ramza_Claus's Mexicanish pizza. My wife picked chameleon10's Philly cheese steak ~~heart attack~~ pizza. Although, we'll be ordering these next time because she brought home Round Table without asking first. She's inconsiderate like that. ;)  Also, I picked two honorable mentions for the great write-ups they submitted even if I didn't want to order the pizza they described.  Congrats!  ----   **EDIT: WINNERS PICKED AND PM'ed.**  I really liked reading all the pizzas, everyone. I hope you liked the contest. I'll let you know who won when I've completed the transactions.   ----  **The Contest:**  1. Describe what pizza you'd order from Domino's.  2. The first two that I think sound good will get a $10 e-card.   **The Rules:**  Only one pizza description per comment. If there's more than one, it's an invalid entry. If you choose toppings that Domino's doesn't offer, it's an invalid entry. Your first valid comment that describes a pizza is your entry. If you go on to describe other pizzas in other comments, you did that for the hell of it. I will pick the two I like  (that's 1 pizza from two different people) and announce them probably when I order dinner (about 1-2 hours from now). DO NOT PM ME YOUR ENTRY.  **Winning Criteria**  I like the sound of the pizza you describe. Yup, it's 100% subjective. This is all about the 'za. Your personal story will not factor in to my decision (let's keep it light hearted). You have to be in a part of the world I can send an e-card too. I think that's the US only but feel free to let me know if I'm wrong.	1367030045.0

[xpost RAoA]	We love this place, the people are super friendly and they are always so kind to the kids... but EVERY TIME we go they give us a page out of a random coloring book and the menu.

You can sign it if you wish!  A few things about the restaurant: It's called Huckleberry Square Restaurant. They have a Native American theme on the inside and on their menu.

I will pick a winner on Monday (4/15/13).  I don't mind how old your account is, nor do I care when your amazon items were added (this was posted on RAoA, so we will change it to pizza, or even an email Walmart gift card  so you can go buy ypurself some pizza--and soda---or what ever!) I am thinking I will do a $30 limit (but am flexible if you go above and beyond!)  I look forward to seeing what you come up with!

t3_199qrn	1361901568.0	shdwscrp	pizza-gold	[Contest] Restore My Faith In Humanity	Throughout my past I've always helped those in need expecting nothing in return because it's my belief that the individuals I helped will pay it forward in one way or another.  I started a personal mission a few years back where I take in a homeless person, help them write a resume, get them a suit, and help them find a job. I've been successful on 4 occasions and they are all living fairly awesome lives right now, but as of late I haven't had the time to continue it; Though I do hope to start up again soon.  Over the last 2 months I've given out a total of 7 e-gift cards to various pizza joints to the point where Domino's stopped accepting my orders one day because they thought someone stole my card and was putting fraudulent charges on it. That being said, it should be quite obvious I enjoy helping people.  In the last couple of weeks things have been going downhill (Possibility I may be losing my job in the next few months because of cuts, loss of a friend, etc).   So I ask, please restore my faith in humanity.   *****  **Contest rules are as follows:**  - Write a story of the most selfless act you've done (preferably something you can prove with pictures or something to that effect, but if you don't have any don't let it deter you, a good story is still valid)  OR  - Make a video of helping a random stranger out with absolutely anything, could have been done in the past, but it has to be proven that it's you (i.e. say your reddit username in the video at some point in time).   *****  Top 3 posts (my choosing) will receive a $25 gift card to one of the primary 3 of their choosing.  Contest will close this coming Saturday (March 2nd) at 12:00 PM PST. Results and PMs will be sent out and posted Sunday. RAOP rules still apply and for the love of whatever deity you do or do not worship do not delete your posts. I know others will take solace in your words. Also, multiple submissions are more than welcome, but you can only win once.  For those of you that took the time to read this, thank you. For those willing to participate, I commend you.  Additionally, if I believe that your story/video is tear-jerking enough and you're not part of the top 3 I have no problem rewarding you as well with a $15 e-gift card.  Lastly, if anyone wants to donate to my efforts, please feel free to PM me with what you're willing to part with and if you'd like to help judge.   ***** **Winners**  **^Top ^Prizes**  [Dananator](/u/Dananator) - PAID!

t3_195ctt	1361737873.0	brom333	PIF	[Contest] introduce me to a new song/band	So I have been working as a volunteer mental-health therapist for low-income people for the past 6 months and as such, haven't had any extra money. I just got a new job last week and while I haven't made any money yet I would like to pay a pizza forward.  Up for grabs is a $10 E-Gift card to your choice of Dominoes, Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.  Whoever can introduce me to an enjoyable new song/band I **haven't** heard of before will win! I will select the winner in 24 hours from when this was posted.  I enjoy a broad spectrum of music such as: Girl Talk, Daft Punk, The Bird and the Bee, Pretty lights, Caravan Palace, Parov Stelar, Mumford & Sons, and [jazz like this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=HMnrl0tmd3k).  **EDIT 1**: I will make a strong effort to reply to posts that I **Have** already heard.   **EDIT 2**: links appreciated.   ~~**EDIT 3**: Currently a more than 80  participants who want pizza, but only a few upvotes - that's a weird ratio...~~    **EDIT 4**: There were a lot of great entries and I am very pleased with the results. Because of the diversity of the music, it is difficult to declare a clear winner. As such, I have compiled a list of the best entries and then used [Random.org]( http://www.random.org/) (a random number generator) to select the winner. If the winner doesn’t reply to my PM within 5 hours (enough time to check the contest) then I will use Random.org again and select another winner from the **Runners up** list. Thank you everyone for your participation. It was a blast for me, and hopefully other participants learned of some new music too.    The Winner is: theriddler41!!! Congratulations! I have sent you a PM. You have 5 hours to reply.  **Runners up:**   Teenagegothgirl – [Goldfish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-tNUur2YoU)  have very visually entertaining videos.   Damascius – [Chet Baker - Almost Blue]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4PKzz81m5c)   theriddler41 – [Gramophonedzie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uT8OEtf5r1U)   cappy321 – Chaos Chaos. I really love the instrumentals and vocals of their song [“My Hands”]( https://soundcloud.com/chaoschaos/my-hands-by-chaos-chaos)   CapoGuy – [Grum – Through the night]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N_yF7I1VIE)   Instame – [Metronomy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PnOG67flRA)    **Honorable mention to:**   MissM00gle85 -  [Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4iLkdaK_uo) had great instrumentals and the lead singer had a great beard, but I just couldn’t get behind his vocals.   gerbillionaire – [Alt-J has very interesting vocals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVeMiVU77wo)   philo-sopher – [Bohren & der Club of Gore]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECyfX1OR_nk)   A_Wet_Towel – [Fleet Foxes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSB74LZDNr0)   Ninjakabob – [Kenny Garett]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usnjclLNnTI)   wolf_redrum – [XXYYXX - slow down]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8Q5kzUlim8)    **EDIT 6**: theriddler41 has confirmed.

t3_192fjn	1361597459.0	_jeth	FAP	[contest]  $15 to one of the big three if you can make me squee!  	So I've given some pizzas and I've gotten some pizzas and now my finances are back in the giving territory and it's time for a contest!    Between now and Sunday, February 24th at 9am CT you may post one (and only one) entry for this contest.  The content of your entry must be a video (short clip please), animated gif, or a pretty effin' adorable picture of some creature doing something cute or funny that will make me squee.  By creature I mean to suggest animal.  Baby humans don't really do it for me, sorry.  Whatever makes my partner and I squee the hardest wins $15 GC to one of the big three.  Must be an active redditor (at least one month of activity on the site and at least 100 karma), only open to US-based individuals or those who can put a US-based GC to good use somehow, and may the cutest, most squee-tastic video/gif/pic win!  P.S.  I have seen a lot of contests lately where people are actually down voting other people's submissions in hopes of raising their own up.  Please, I beg of you, don't be that dude.  Let your entry stand on its own merit.  Thank you for your time.  /soapbox  **Alright, closing up the entries now. We will judge and then report back with a decision today. Thanks. :)  Final Edit:  Alright, my partner had to go to work early so I got to judge these myself which is why it took awhile.  First off, thanks to everyone who participated in it.  This huge volume of squee was exactly what I needed this morning and I will be bookmarking this thread for future squee-usage.  That said, I was going to give away a few different pizzas in a few different contests but the sheer volume of awesome in this one deserved a bit more than a one pizza reward, so I'm awarding three pizzas.  I wish I could award one to each of you because your entries were awesome.  :D  In no particular order, pizzas go to:  /u/kramdiw for the kangaroo/wombat babies post (wombats are one of my animal weaknesses)  /u/potently-potable for the corgi freaking out every time food is offered (and then dragging its bowl off camera like a dead body)  and   /u/Dblueguy for kitten pillow trap (the kitten, clearly, gives zero fucks and continues trying to play)  I am messaging the winners now.  Thank you everyone for your participation and I hope to do this again sometime soon.  :D ** 	1361741956.0

t3_18o5it	1361067603.0	dam360	pizza	[Contest] $20 to your choice of the Big 3!!! (U.S. only)	It's time to play find an awesome shirt for me to judge. Find a shirt you feel I will enjoy and post a verified picture of it being worn. My favorite gets $20 to their choice of the Big 3!!! Here are the rules as follows.  1. Account must be at least 1 month old.  2. Your entry must be verified. Any picture that is not verified will be disqualified automatically.  3. The shirt you are using as your entry must be worn in the picture. I don't want you looking for a shirt on google or finding something out of a magazine. If you don't own a cool shirt, go to Wal-Mart/Target/ any place that sells T-shirts and take a picture. You can also use a person you randomly found on the street.  4. 1 entry per person.  5. If you are worried about the verification covering up the shirt or are afraid of posting a picture of yourself to the internet, you can take two pictures. Have one where you are wearing the shirt without showing your face and another with the shirt on your bed or something, the latter being verified.  6. The deadline is Monday at 8:00pm CT. Any post after that is automatically disqualified.  7. I understand that your surgery failed and as a result you can no longer move any part of your body except your mouth which magically still has the power to consume food. This is a contest and begging will get you nowhere. If you do beg/whine/complain, I will probably just forget your post exists.  Well, I think that's everything. Oh wait, I forgot. My wife loves being a judge of this contest. That being said, there will be 2 winners, one I pick and one my wife picks. Both will receive a $20 gift card. It could also be that my wife and I love the same shirt, in which case that person will win $40. In other words the stakes are high. Here are a list of our interest to give you something to work with.  Husband: I love nerd games like D&D. I also love video games, musicals, and super heroes. My favorite is the Green Lantern. I am also a huge Star Wars fan, as in I have read a lot of the books, seen all the movies, etc.  Wife: I like cute. Or funny. Preferably both. Dumb jokes usually work best for me. I love Harry Potter, Futurama, and comedy movies (Idiocracy and the like).  Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot to this contest. Good luck everybody, and happy hunting!!!  **We are now judging. Any post past this point is automatically disqualified.**  **Thank you everyone for your awesome entries. Unfortunately, we can only pick two shirts, but I shall have you know that we would happily own every single shirt posted. The results of the contest are as follows:**  **Husband: kramdiw**  **Wife: annpanda**  **Thanks again everybody and may your shirts always be nerdy.**	1361239619.0

t3_17scws	1359859929.0	dam360	pizza	[Contest] $30 to your choice of the Big 3!!! (U.S. only)	**A reminder to everyone that there has only been one story posted and the deadline is tonight at 7:00pm CT. Good Luck**  **Sorry I'm late, but I'm now reading everything. Because of how late it is I will have to but the pizza tomorrow. Again, my apologies.**  **Congratulations aroracle. You are the winner. Tomorrow, I will buy you An e-gift card to your choice of the big 3. Please pm me with your choice as well as your e-mail. Also, not sure why, but only 2 people posted even though I was late.**  To be blunt, I have been wanting some good reading material. As a result, I decided what better place to find great and original reading material than from reddit. Here's how the contest will work.  1. Accounts must be at least 1 month old.  2. You must post that your are interested in taking part in this contest. I will only allow the first seven people who post to take place in this contest. If by tomorrow at 7:00pm CT seven people have not posted, I will cut it off then. If only one person responds saying they want to participate I will do the contest another day.  3. Once seven people respond, or we reach the deadline, I will randomly select a genre for you. You will then have to write a short story of whatever length you feel appropriate without being longer than 1 comment length that fits into your genre.  4. The deadline to turn in your short story will be one week from tomorrow at 7:00pm CT. If you don't submit it by that point you will be disqualified.  5. I understand that you may have 10 starving children whom you can't feed because your sick and dying aunt is demanding food, however, this is a contest. Posting that you are in such a predicament will not help you win, but might make me forget to acknowledge your post.  That's it everybody. First 7 to comment saying they want to participate have a chance to win a $30 gift card. Good Luck.  **Here are the results of the random genre generator as follows:**  **RockyCoon: Fantasy**  **Weldhelmet: Romance**  **wonderland_lily: Sci-Fi**  **t_l_m: Horror**  **destinyisntfree: Mystery**  **aroracle: Drama**  **LaurenroseV: Comedy**  **You have till two Sundays from now at 7:00pm CT. That is 2-10-13 at 7:00pm CT. Feel free to submit your post any time before that. Good Luck.**	1360551077.0
t3_17g6bm	1359405436.0	RorySBarnes	pizza	[Contest] Ever wanted to make a video game? (UK Only!)	Finally, I am in a stable enough financial situation that I can Pizza Forward! So I'm going to. I'm going to in STYLE.  Ladies and Gentlemen of RAOP, I am RorySBarnes, I am an independent games developer, currently at university to improve my skills, and last year I received a pizza in my time of need, and I will now give forward in triplicate.  Tomorrow is Tuesday, and for everyone in the UK, that's 2 for Tuesdays. There are 3 up for grabs (3x2, that is, so, 6 in total) and to win, you must do the following:  Create an idea for a video game.  The best idea will earn you 2x Large Dominos pizzas of your choice (woop woop!) A 1.5ltr bottle of whatever your poison is (soft drink poison, that is...), AND I will attempt to make your vision a reality for either my February or March Game of the Month, as part of my OneGameAMonth attempt!  The two second best ideas will receive 2x Medium Dominos pizzas of your choice. I might use your idea in the future, but I can't guarantee it. D:  You have until 5pm GMT tomorrow to pitch your ideas! GET TO IT!  EDIT: I've had to shorten the contest since I just remembered I am going out tonight, and will not be home when I planned on finishing the contest. Hurry up! There are only 3 entries so far, so it looks like the winners are obvious unless some other people take part! :D  EDIT2: It's 4:30pm, and I'm officially calling it!  First Place: Odd-One-Out, with 20:13!  You win 2 large pizzas of your choice from Domanomnomnominos, a 1.5 ltr bottle of your choosing, and like I promised I will do my utmost to make your game a reality. I didn't imagine that there would be so much effort put into the idea, though, so it's going to be later rather than sooner, but I can assure you IT SHALL BE DONE!  And the runners up, each bagging 2x medium pizzas of their choice, are gak94 (pizza'd!) and robin_hoodie_ (pizza'd!)! I'll attempt to make those two in the future, too!  I'm actually surprised that there aren't many more UK-ers who took part to be honest! It was close! :D I'll PM you separately.	1360505350.0
t3_17ddcm	1359301116.0	thetruedarkone	FAP	[CONTEST] USA, it's time for a free pizza	I wish I could pick 2 people. I have to look at my budget, I'll announce the winner shortly!   TheUserNameTaker is the winner! I'll PM you	1359756186.0
t3_17cpo0	1359259560.0	dam360	pizza	[Contest] $20 to your choice of the Big 3!!! (U.S. only)	After the success of my last offer I decided I'd like to do another contest, but it would be boring to just do the same thing twice. As a result, I asked my wife for ideas and she came up with a new twist to my last contest. Instead of looking for cars, you're looking for shirts. Here are the rules of the contest as follows.  1. Accounts must be at least 1 month old.  2. All shirts must be worn by a person and verified. If you can't fit the verification into the picture without covering up part of the shirt, take two photos so we will still be able to see the shirt in its entirety.  3. Begging/Whining/Moaning about how I am making you grovel will just get your post ignored. I understand that you might be in a tight spot, but this is a contest, not a charity.  4. Only 1 entry is allowed per person. If there is more than one shirt in your picture, say which one you wish to be your entry.  5. The deadline is Tuesday at 7:00pm CT. Anything posted after that point will not be judged.  6. Unlike last time, you cannot use a shirt from a magazine or the like. I reserve the right to say that your entry doesn't count. To avoid this, go out and actually find a shirt in the real world.  Also, as I said before, my wife helped me come up with this contest and as a result wants in. Because of this, there will be two winners, one picked by me, the other picked by my wife. Both people will receive a $20 gift card. It is also possible that we will both pick the same person as our winner, in which case that person gets a $40 gift card, so the stakes are high. Here is a description of our interests.  Husband: I am a nerd at heart. I love Star Wars and well as D&D and superheroes. I am also a pretty big video game fan. I also love movies, preferably dark movies with a great story.  Wife: I like funny things, mostly. I do like some nerdiness, but mostly jokes. Nerd jokes work pretty well. Or cute things. Or just interesting things.  My apologies for my wife's vagueness. Her exact quote after she typed out the above paragraph was "I wanna confuse them. I can't make this too easy." Anyway, good luck on your journey and happy hunting!  **My wife and I are now judging. Anything posted past this point is automatically disqualified. After some debate, fisticuffs, and various shenanigans we have finally decided our winners. The results are as follows**  **Wife: Tangoberry**  **Husband: Aprilynn**  **I can only be on the internet for a little while longer, so please pm me your e-mail address as well as your choice of the big 3. If I have to leave before we figure everything out, I will get on it first thing tomorrow. Thanks guys for such a fun contest.** 	1359508338.0

t3_16wl24	1358643546.0	dam360	pizza	[Contest] $25 to your choice of the Big 3! (Details inside)	So, here's the deal. I love cars. It's not that I know a lot about cars, but rather that I enjoy them. As such, the purpose of this contest is to post a verified picture of yourself with a car of some kind. I will pick the car I like best and that person will receive an $25 e-gift card to their choice of the Big 3! I will also give out a second place e-gift card worth $15. Here are the rules as follows.  1. Anyone participating must have use an account which is at least 1 month old. No exceptions. Also, U.S. only.  2. This is not /r/foodpantry or /r/Assistance. If you are desperately in need of food for whatever reason, feel free to go to one of those sub-reddits. Sob stories, as well as complaining, will get you absolutely nowhere with me. In fact, I will probably just ignore your post altogether.  3. Your picture must be verified. If you are worried about having your identity posted on the internet, then take a picture of a car with just your username included in the picture. I just want to make sure that you didn't find this car through Google, but rather that you went out and searched for it.  4. I will be determining the winner this coming Monday at 7:00pm Ct. If you post your picture after that, you will be disqualified.  5. In case you haven't realized it yet, the car you post a picture of does not need to be your own. If you don't own a cool car, look around for one. I have given you 2 days to go searching, so time shouldn't be an issue.  6. My interpretation of cool can mean a lot of things.  A Ferrari will not necessarily be the winner. It can be interesting or cool for a number of reasons besides its actual worth.  7. There is only one car per entry.  I believe that's everything. If you have any questions, feel free to ask away and I will do my best to answer them. I do not have 24 hour access to the internet, so you will have to be patient with me. Good luck and good hunting!  The winners are as follows  1st place goes to GhostRider22  2nd place goes to skinlessmonkey  Thank you all for making this such a fun contest. I can only be on the internet for about smith 30 minutes, so p.m. me with your choice of the Big 3 as well as your e-mail address.	1358816881.0

t3_13folk	1353300287.0	psm321	psm321	[Contest] sentence-picture results/voting thread, plus a twist (= more pizza prizes available)!	**Intro**  This is a followup to my offer [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/13e2fs/offer_lets_play_sentencepicture/).  Unfortunately, AlchemicalMusical had to pull out due to an emergency, leaving only 2 players.  At first I was going to cancel, but then I thought of a way to improvise and make it work by participating myself.  AlchemicalMusical gets a $5 gift card for providing one of the starting sentences.  ---  **The Games**  There were only two games.  *First set:*  * Sentence by me: The merry-go-round spun faster and faster until everyone on it threw up and then started having hallucinations.  * Picture by Sabromex: [http://i.imgur.com/9MREb.png](http://i.imgur.com/9MREb.png) (took significantly longer than the allotted 15 minutes)  * Sentence by blargiznoflo: The hairy Ferris wheel caused many parkgoers to puke.  *Second set:*  * Sentence by AlchemicalMusical: The spinning record on the turntable was shattered by falling bowling balls.  * Picture by blargiznoflo: [http://i.imgur.com/FZQlm.png](http://i.imgur.com/FZQlm.png)  * Sentence by Sabromex: The black record fell swiftly onto the jukebox playing a song called What's new Pussy Cat.  ---  **The Voting**  Below, you will see two comments by me: one for Sabromex and one for blargiznoflo.  Give one of them (or I suppose both, though that seems pointless) an upvote for their contributions.  The person with the most upvotes by 11pm EST on Tuesday, Nov. 20th will get an extra $10 card.  **Downvotes do not count.  Please don't use multiple accounts to vote.**  ---  **The Twist -- Read carefully!!**  There were delays and other time idiosyncrasies on the part of both players.  This prevented a second game from being completed.  However, Sabromex was able to draw a picture for another sentence that I provided.  You can find this picture here: [http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png](http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png)  I will post a third comment that says "Make a sentence for this picture: [http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png](http://i.imgur.com/1bKyC.png)".  Out of the replies **to this comment**, around 11pm EST on Tuesday, Nov. 20th, a $10 prize (US Pizza Hut eGift Card) will go to the most upvoted reply (again, downvotes don't count), and another $10 prize will go to the reply that comes closest (in my judgement) to the original sentence I provided Sabromex.  Sabromex and blargiznoflo are ineligible for this portion.  One entry per person please, and again please don't use multiple accounts to circumvent this or upvote multiple times (but feel free to upvote multiple entries).  ---  **Update/Results**  * Sabromex wins the extra $10 with 9 upvotes to blargiznoflo's 7.  * ohitsthatguy86 wins a $10 card for the most upvoted sentence "Reddit is sad over the amount of trolls looking for pizza" with 5 upvotes  * The sentence I gave Sabromex, from which he drew the picture, was "The kind Redditor was insulted by a troll for having too many rules in his pizza offer.".  In my judgement, Dendo1 came closest with "A sad Redditor was offended by a troll because he had a list of rules for his pizza giveaway", so he wins a $10 card.  * Why so many downvotes on things when I said they wouldn't count?  Just wondering...	1353471130.0

THANKS FOR THE FUN.  :D**     So between coin roll hunting and never spending any of my change I amassed this http://imgur.com/TyDUb.jpg mound of change. Last night I rolled most of it up and counted it all. **What do you think the total amount is?** There are nickels, dimes, quarters, halves and dollar coins included. I'll let this run all day and pick the person that guesses the right amount, or the closest without going over (yes, like the Price is Right but a $1 bid here will suck) when I'm done working and doing my errands. I'm EST and will be checking throughout the day in case someone gets it quicker but I don't want to put an end time in case I'm not at a PC at that very minute. Good luck, winner gets a $20 gift card to your choice of the big three.  **Totally random, but I do require that accounts are at least 30 days old and active on subs other than looking for free shit.**  **The total was $1141.15!

t3_12vi0p	1352406594.0	NikkoE82	pizza	[CONTEST] Help 60 college students get a pizza party and I'll give out FOUR gift cards! Pick a number between 1-4,000.	Here's the story. Today, my professor offered my class a chance for a pizza party.  If we can get at least 1,000 likes for his non-profit's Facebook page, he'll buy us all pizza.  If we can get 2,000, he'll throw in cupcakes.  If we can get 3,000, he'll throw in cold soda.  This is the Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Big-Sell/130452977004303  It's a cool event he holds once a year where entrepreneurs have an opportunity to pitch their idea and win a chance to see that idea realized.  At the time he offered this, the number of likes was roughly 415.  Here's what I'm going to do for you guys:  Automatically, I'm going to give away a $10 gift card to whoever comes closest to the number I've assigned to that amount by 7PM EST tonight.  Then, I'll give away a $25 gift card for every 1,000 increase in likes from 415 up to 3,415.  So, at 1,415 I'll give away the first $25 gift card to who ever is closest to the number I've assigned to that gift card.  The best part for you is we have a couple of weeks to get those 1,000-3,000 likes. So that part of the contest will stay open as long as it can.  One number per person, please. I wanted to come up with a way to give those who actually "Like" the page a chance to pick two numbers, but I couldn't come up with a decent way of determining that. If you have a suggestion, I'll take it.  EDIT: The $10 gift card has been won by *drumroll* rebelfeather12 with a guess of 2424. The number was 2415. Congrats, rebelfeather12! Remember, everyone else, that the remaining gift cards are still in play!  EDIT II: Sorry, everyone. This contest is over. We gave it our best but it just didn't cut it. It was fun, though! And my teacher seemed to really appreciate my effort.	1354896505.0

Once someone claims it I'll reveal how it was done.  -------  edit 2: **Contest is NOT over yet** There is still $6.42 on the card.  -------  edit 1: It looks like we have our first winner, the card balance is down to $6.42 now.  Here's a hint for anyone still working on this if you want to try to get the $6.42: the numbers below are in hexadecimal.  -------  Hi all,  Been a while since I've posted; I thought I would do a contest this time.  This one is for computer programmers, or someone with at least a little bit of computer knowledge.  I have a Pizza Hut gift card that has $35.40 left on it -- and I'm going to tell you what the number is.  The catch?  The number is encoded.  I'm not going to tell you how it is encoded.  Here's what you need to decipher:  4d4441784d5441784d5441774d4445784d4441774d4441774d5445774d5445774d4441784d5441784d5441774d4445784d4441784d5441774d5445774d4445784d4441784d5445774d4441770a4d4445784d4445774d4441774d5445774d4445774d4441784d5445774d4445774d4445784d4441774d4441774d5445784d4441784d4441784d4441774d4441774d4445784d4441774d5441770a4d5445774d4445784d4441784d5441774d4441774d4445784d4441784d413d3d  The end result, should you get it, will be 12 numbers followed by a space followed by 4 numbers.  Good luck!  P.S. Here's proof that the card exists: http://i.imgur.com/t8LHa.png	1349387414.0

Maybe a rubber room...  Still hanging out around the reddits and will be throwing out some pies here and there.  I've enjoyed doing this this thang for the past year and happy I was able to to it.    As I said previously, I'm simply diverting some extra $$ to /r/RandomActsOfChristmas to help out parents without the financial means to provide their kids a decent Christmas day.  /u/pookie85 helped start the sub just last season...and was a complete success.  The Christmas day pics users sent in...the looks on those kids faces made it all worth while.    So if you're able to be a "Santa" or need one, or just curious... check it out :)  Should be going within the next few weeks.    Cheers!!       	1348874440.0
t3_10a7eg	1348284439.0	Quaquaversal	pizza-gold	[Contest] Geeky Mash-Up Sketchery-Artiness (US Only) Open to Any IRL Age, Any Skill Level	**Contest is now closed!**  **Champion winner** - I contacted both the first and third placers twice but never heard back, the 2nd and the 1st 4th prize winners have already claimed their awards, so that makes **youdneverbelieveit** the Champion prize winner! Woohoo and congratulations, sir!   **You're Number Two!** winner is **hBoBh**, with the clever combos of Back to the Future screen shots (Marvin!) with MLP and Star Wars.  **Charmer Prize** goes to wolfulez, who garnered the most votes with two clever takes on fairly famous pop cultural icons - seriously, Jareth as a DJ? XD.  **Random Surprise Prize Pizza** ($7.99 for Dominos Artisan, or for $7.99 towards any other chain) goes to **Cyae1**, whose Minecraft creations I thoroughly enjoyed being taken on a little narrative tour through (especially the casual reference to the Tardis :P), but mostly because you got me on to *The IT Crowd* which is freaking hilarious.  **. . .**  **Guess what? I'M NOT DONE YET!!! No indeed, I have not finished. I have instead gone utterly mad! Wooo! You know why? Because EVERYBODY wins something! Ha ha! Ha ha!**  **voodoobreath**, you too get Random Surprise Prize Pizzas, because I liked your submissions (but it took me a while to 'get' get them, sorry)! And I'll get your $7.99 'zas in motion as soon as I hear from you.    It's that time again, when I have the urge to give away a pizza, while also turning it into a mildly evil little challenge. Because that is my idea of fun. Ha ha ha ha HAAAAA!     I’m a geeky person, or maybe I just like to think I am, and I like random artiness. I have a soft spot in my heart for the art mash-ups of my favorite shows/movies/books/etc which I see scattered all over the internet, all created by artists of various skill, age, and walks of life.  So the contest is this:   **Draw, sketch, electronically paint, photoshop (or similar), or doodle a mash-up drawing, sketch, electronic painting, photoshoppery image, or doodle about, including, or relating to *at least* two of the following:**    Doctor Who, Star Wars, Star Trek, Sherlock (any incarnation), Leverage, My Little Pony, Big Bang Theory, Avengers (both the British ones and the Marvel ones are cool), superheroes, Chrestomanci, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Psych, IMF, Buckaroo Banzai, Labyrinth, anime, superheroes, reddit, or anything reasonably recognizable as having a fandom.   Why those? Because those are my favorites that I could think of off the top of my head at the time I wrote this. If you have a great idea for something not on the list, and worry I might not "get" it, let me know what show or comic or whatever it is and I’ll get myself as much up to speed on the subject as possible before the close date so your contribution gets the fairest shot possible.   **Loose-ish Rules**  1. ALL skill levels welcome.  2. Contest open to US redditors who are any age IRL, but whose accounts are at least two months old and whose RAoP histories aren't mostly about getting pizza and not thanking anyone. I like manners. Manners are nice.  3. Any approach is fine (excepting exceptions below). I’m particularly a sucker for: funny, cute, clever, epic-ish, thought-provoking, action-adventure-y, twists, suspense, or all of the above.  4. Any style is fine (excepting exceptions below). This is *not* a beauty contest. Draw/create/etc. according to your ability, and maybe keep it to something you can do in under a couple of hours. After all, in this contest, a stick figure cartoon with a caption blurb could win out over anything Van Gogh's ever done. It is for fun and pizza! Please don't drive yourself bonkers over that.  6.  Submit as many submissions as you like until the contest closes.  7. If someone submits something that breaks a rule, you spot it before I do, and you feel compelled to say something - please do so nicely. Everyone is welcome to re-work any of their submissions until the contest closes.  8. Submit links to your artwork here, so everyone can enjoy them.  **Rules the breaking of which will result in immediate disqualification**  1.  Keep it safe for all ages. No porn, no gore, no swearing, no drugs, no nudity/nearly nudity, no suggestive anything, no mean-spiritedness, no R-rated anything (well, except for Die Hard. Die Hard’s awesome. But still try not to traumatize the kids).   2. No trolling, bullying, name-calling or nasty behaviors of any kind, including the sneaky passive aggressive kind, ’cause that’s just not cool. Do your best to be excellent to each other.  3. No submissions from accounts that are as many days old as this contest - or less - will be accepted.  4. No representing someone else's already-published work as yours. Plagiarizing is *bad*. Plagiarizing for pizza is bad and sad.  5. No bullying the winners. The contest owner also prefers not to be razzed, but if I missed something I'm open to constructive criticism, and will adjust as needed.  7. No trying to gain an edge on everyone else by sharing your sob story.  8. No breaking the law! Banksy's cool, but if you don't have the property-owner's permission, put the aerosol paint down and back awayyyy from that wall.   **The following are the prizes**:    **The Champion**, to my favorite submission of all: One large 3 topping pizza from Papa John's, for delivery or carryout.   **You’re Number Two!** My 2nd favorite: The best pizza that can be had for $15 from a franchise near you   **Third One’s the Charmer** I like it and so do your fellow contestants/redditors. Woohoo! This’ll go to the one with the most upvotes (after the ones previously rewarded): The best pizza that can be had for $10 from a franchise near you.   **Possible Random Awesome Surprise Prize Pizza**: This one is a maybe. It's a thing I like to do sometimes IRL, but it depends on how a particular event goes. The two hints I'll give on it are: even redditors who have no entries in this contest have a chance at it, and it's not a random lottery.  **Contest ends:** Next week at 8pm (MT) on Friday, September 28. Winner of the Papa John’s pizza will be notified by PM on the 28th, and will have 24 hours to respond. This is because that prize is being paid for out of the ‘free’ points I got from a Papa John's deal. The points expire on the 30th, so if I haven't heard from you by Saturday, I'll move on for my own peace of mind. Everyone else can take up to a week after being notified to get back to me on where to send the pizza/card.  **TL;DR:** Contest to draw a mash-up involving geek pop culture, any age OK, keep it clean, have fun, three main prizes with qualifying winners will be announced on the 28th, possible 4th pizza depending on how things go; oh, and all creators retain full rights to their work. Yay!  EDIT: Grammar tweaks  EDIT 2: Realized I left out that Photoshop (and similar wizardry) is ok. Photoshop is OK, guys!  EDIT 3: Learned how to correctly spell "aerosol"	1349230986.0

Here's what I'm looking for....  **Draw the the first poster's username interacting with your own username.  (No X-rated drawrings, por favor.)**  It doesn't have to be glamorous or fantastic, just amuse me.  Here's what you win:  The artist will get a *$20 GC* to one of the big 3.   The "model" will get a *$10 GC* to one of the big 3 for being a good sport.    You can only be the "model" once or draw once.  You can play or draw, but you can't play play or draw draw....er something.

We are donating proceeds to the public schools' arts programs in our area. For the prologue, we decided on projecting an animation sequence. We thought white line art on a black background would look great. Our graphic artist had to drop out because of a death in his family. If someone on here can create an animation that we can use in our production, I will gladly provide a $50 egift card to the winners choice of the big three. Just pm your work and I will review it and make a decision. The deadline for submissions is Sept 7th and I will announce the winner on the 8th. Thanks!!  EDIT: to be more specific - Listen to the prologue of beauty And the beast (Disney's) and create an animation of the story. Perhaps it's not possible to pm the work to me, but is it possible I email it? I'll PM my email address to you if you have something to submit  Sorry. Words are hard...	1345911298.0

t3_x5p8f	1343257368.0	Just_another_man	pizza	[Contest]Are you a fitness buff? Prove yourself in this contest.	I love fitness. I work out extensively, and am focused on bodybuilding. I have a strict diet that I follow, and am meticulous about my health. I don't even eat pizza, or any type of fast food. I cook all my own meals.   However. I do love pizza. And I do love the premise of Random_Acts_Of_Pizza. So here is my contest to give away some pizza.  Post your workout routine, be proud of yourself! Tell me all about it. Diet, workouts, everything. I love hearing about it all.   Post pictures of your progress if you are comfortable and proud of yourself. I assure you this is a judgement free zone! Be vain in this thread though! I can't say that pictures will earn you bonus points, but  they might help a bit!  You've worked hard in the gym, now reward yourself with some pizza! I don't have a whole lot of money, but I am offering a $20 gift card to a pizza place yet to be decided. I will say this is my first time giving pizza, so you might have to bare with me as I get the hang of it. Also, American only, as I'm not sure how to give internationally. Though if you can provide help on doing so, I have no problems with that either.  Curious about me, are you? [Here's an album](http://imgur.com/a/zaqcg), but the pictures are not in order. Just a few random ones. Let's see what you got!  EDIT: KEEP THEM COMING! I'll keep it open for another 24 hours and then I'll announce a winner. EDIT: Alright folks thanks for all the submissions! I'll announce the winner tomorrow!  ALRIGHT! I decided on the winner! It was a tough call but I decided inflexiblemadness wins! I really liked his diet and his motivation! Everyone else was really pretty close and it was a tough call. I've been swamped with work lately, but will work on getting a gift card set up for the winner! Thanks everyone!	1343689131.0

I know this is quite annoying and I apologize, but original post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/wcmuz/contest_making_a_new_raop_video_soon_and_i_need/) and it would be very nice if you would leave your comment (and picture!) in that post.  That way, it's easier to keep up with everything.   Thank you very much.	
t3_wcmuz	1341957181.0	pookie85	FAP	[Contest] Making a new RAoP video soon and I need YOUR thank you photos!	Yes. This is a contest! Woohoo!  All right, so I've made a few RAoP videos in the past, and I've been slacking severely lately.  Who can participate?  **Anyone who posts a previous thank you picture (from the months of April to recent)**, OR if you just want to snap a picture right now, saying thank you to RAoP for being such an awesome community..that totally works!  In my opinion, thank you pictures have been dwindling in the past half year or so.  I don't see half as many as I used to, which is sad.  I understand some people don't have a camera and what not...but not even a thank you post.  That's not cool.  As a giver (it feels awesome to say that now), it's nice to see someone's smiling face enjoying the pizza you were able to provide to them.    So..Rules for the contest?  Post a picture with you holding a sign saying "THANK YOU RAoP!"  Or to someone in particular if you wish.  **Who can participate?**  EVERYONE IN RAoP!  Someone is going to get a pizza. : D [But you have to post a thank you picture!](http://i.imgur.com/MQwOk.png)  **The deadline?**  Friday night. 8:30 PM.  This will give me time to pick a winner and ship out a gift card, etc.  This is EST, so keep that in mind. **Please live in the states**, and if you don't..hopefully we can find a way around that!    **Note:** I am working on getting more givers involved with this so there may be a **chance** of more than one giftcard here.

t3_vzact	1341326475.0	_jeth	FAP	[CONTEST]  Paying it forward!  A pie in exchange for your worst first date story.  	So the other day I was the recipient of my first RAOP from Yunododat and as I was quite literally broke this weekend (and sick) it helped save my ass when my date refused to cancel because of my plague (so sweet) and it went so well that we were still hanging out late enough to need to order a pizza.    So long story short, RAOP helped me have an amazing night, but I know that it could have gone very, very differently.  So the contest I propose is as such:  I want to hear your absolute worst first date story in excruciating detail.  In exchange for your worst, most cringe-worthy story I will be awarding a $15GC to the place of your choice for the person whose story made me cringe and shriek the most.    Contest runs through 8pm CT on Tuesday, July 3rd.  One winner will be chosen by me.  Make me cringe, get a pie!  It's that easy.  :)))  Edit1:  Half an hour until I curb the entries and there have been some stunners so far.  It's going to be very hard to pick one winner, but you all have given me a lot of mirth on my breaks and on my work lunch today.  :D  Edit2:  Entries are closed!  (last contributor was ericasohodge)  I will go and read through them all carefully again and announce a winner as soon as I can make up my mind.  Some of these are downright BRUTAL.  You all have restored my faith that being a Socially Awkward Penguin is more common than you'd think.  :D  Edit3:  Okay, I want to stress that your entries were AMAZING and some of your experiences were BRUTAL.  From getting t-boned in intersections, finding out you were on a date with your teacher, to dead animal picker-uppers, it's clear that bad first dates do exist and if I had pizzas for everyone I would hand out pizzas for everyone!  But ultimately there were two stories that stuck with me as I kept reading through this, and so I asked a friend to come online, read them all, and tell me his honest opinion as well and he hit on the same two stories I did (without our discussing it previously).    So it is with great pleasure that I announce that we will have not one, but two winners and those winners are [crazyfordisney](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/vzact/contest_paying_it_forward_a_pie_in_exchange_for/c58zg2r) for vividly capturing what it's like to be on a date with a judgmental prick, and [sarahmj13](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/vzact/contest_paying_it_forward_a_pie_in_exchange_for/c58y4mv) who should NOT stop going to the coffee shop because of one awkward date, and whose story was way too close to my own last week (it would have been ramen in my house as well if I hadn't been gifted a RAOP).  Ladies, please message me with the email address where you would like your GCs sent to as well as your preference for restaurant (anywhere I can do an online GC - even a grocery store - is fine by me).  Thank you everyone for sharing, and hopefully I will be able to do this again soon!  :)))	1341365897.0

t3_tynt8	1337656447.0	PastafarianTwit	FSM	[Contest] WILL U MARY ME?!?!	edit 3:  **Contest is over!**  Winning story:  * http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/tynt8/contest_will_u_mary_me/c4qvo4g  Runner up gets a card for another great story:  * http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/tynt8/contest_will_u_mary_me/c4quajh  OK, so here's the deal... 3 entrants per story.  First person leaves a comment to the main thread "Will you marry me?"  Second person replies "OMG, I love you" and the Third person writes the story about how their marriage will go in the future.  The best story will win all 3 participants in it a $20 gift card to the pizza place of your choice of the big 3 pizza places (pizza hut, papa johns, dominos).  Now, the dirty rules. You can participate at **MAX** one of each type of entry (first, second, and third types mentioned above), which also means you get 3 chances to win in this contest if your fellow contestants help you out well.  If you enter more than one of any given type, you will be disqualified.  Also, each thread should only have 3 entrants.  The first person to reply in any given marriage story will be the one counted, so pay attention to time stamps.  If you plan to enter as a 3rd person writing a story, I encourage you to write a place holder reply saying "I've got this story" and follow it up with your story within 30 minutes of claiming it.  If you make a placeholder and haven't written your story within 30 minutes, the story will open up to everyone else.  Timing is important.  Yay timestamps!  Please make your placeholder and actual story two different replies as well so we can keep track of times.  Gift cards will be donated and chosen as a team effort by Tarable and myself.  Winners will be chosen tomorrow (5/22) night at 9PM CST.  Get your creative brains on and have some fun!  Help each other win some pizzas!  edit: one person is allowed to marry RAoPbot if they so choose...  edit 2:  **Come on people, write some stories and help your fellow redditors out.  Without the story, the 3 people in the chain aren't eligible**	1337743733.0

t3_tfmyy	1336610292.0	Rollout	Rollout	[Contest] Anyone like trivia? Details inside...	RAOP has a trivia bot, it was getting a lot of use, and now it is slow...  The highest score by the time I wake up on Saturday (May 12th) gets a 25 dollar Dominos e-gift card. I wake up late, as I work night shift. I might do a runner up prize, have not decided on that yet. If anyone wants to pitch in on this that is welcome too.   Don't worry if someone has a big score, they can not play all day... scores add up quickly....   A FEW RULES: No cheating : Meaning no googling of answers. It is not fair to the rest of the people, and it is quite obvious when people are doing it. Some of the mods will be in the channel keeping an eye on this.   Use the same name in the chat as your reddit name.  Now, to join the trivia you simply go to http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#raop-trivia  Put in your username, fill in the captcha, and hit connect... If you have a irc client (such as mirc, or xchat), you can join us on freenode in channel #raop-trivia ...   If you have, or download a irc client you can get an advantage, you can join the same server as the bot, and decrease your lag time. This matters when multiple people are playing.  The bot is always there, and free to use anytime, not just for the contest, but I thought this would be a cool thing to do ....

Pasta beat me to the punch by a couple minutes, I knew I should have waited to get coffee. Our dear "friend" mitch3910 is in fact deploying, and we wish him well. So here is another contest in his honor to get that scrappy kid some good karma vibes or something.      All you need to do is write your favorite story about mitch3910. It doesn't have to be real. His likes include Buster from Arrested Development, juice boxes, trains, not so pleasant encounters with women from OK Cupid, throwing up in Boston... just check his history for more ideas! Winner gets a $20 egift card to one of the big three.      In all honesty, good luck mitch3910 and let us know if we can pizza you half way across the world!      **EDIT:** FourFingeredMartian has won!	True

One of his favorite things in life is trains (the locomotive kind, get your mind out of the gutter).  I can spare 3 -$20 gift cards to papa johns or pizza hut.  If either of these don't work for you, we might be able to work something else out, and if the winner is international, I'll try and get you some pizza, but I can't guarantee having much luck.  Anyway... ONE (1) gift card goes to someone with the best train drawing.  ONE (1) gift card goes to someone with the best train related story.  ONE (1) gift card goes to the an honorable mention out of either category.  Let's see some cool pictures and hear some interesting train stories. =)  **EDIT: Winners have been chosen!**  * **rose_tyler_fan gets the winning story**  * **jaredcheeda gets the winning artwork**  * **zdigital13 hits it home with the honorable mention!**  **Thank you all for participating and I hope mitch3910 the best as he heads off to Afghanistan.

t3_sj87k	1334900820.0	Better_with_salt	salt	[Contest] US - Funny Costumes or Draw My Fish!	Be creative. I would either like you to post a picture of yourself in funny costume(s), preferably with a way to tell that it is you... or draw your interpretation of my fish, including his tank. Please allow me to tell you a little more about him...  His name is Dexter due to his murderous tendencies. He kills his fishy pals by eating them whole, and has been rewarded with his own private tank to protect the finnocent. I often think he is planning my demise, but that is beside the point. He is a tiger oscar by breed, and he often does an excited wiggly dance when he sees me holding his bag of food pellets (now that I have finally weened him from his taste for blood). Entries must be made by 8PM Pacific time on 4/20.  Edit: Okay, now I'm really torn. I have narrowed it down to Terable and BlazikenTrees. I love the style of Terable's, but BlazikenTree's picture is so close to what my actual set-up looks like that it is uncanny. The only differences are I don't have a crab, and Dexter is on the right... I will decide shortly.  Edit 2: I talked it over with one of my roommates... The winner is BlazikenTrees!!!! We felt that BlazikenTrees' picture best captured Dexter's situation!  Thank you to everyone else who entered. I will have more contests soon!	True

t3_sihet	1334870763.0	Northjayhawk	pizza	[Contest] (US) Giving away 2 $15 e-gift cards tonight	CONTEST OVER: Congratulations to momoffiveky, and pvcducttape.  Contest ends at 8pm ET, and soon after that time I'll give out 2 $15 e-gift cards to two different people from either Pizza Hut, Papa John's, or Domino's. Winners will be chosen with a random number generator. You don't have to tell me a number, I'll just handle it all.  To enter, just comment that you'd like a pizza. If you post a picture of a cute or cool animal (not a cat), you will get 1 extra entry into the random number generator. If you post a picture of a cute or cool cat, you will get 2 extra entries. If you post a cute or cool picture of a cat with today's date (4/19/2012) written, displayed, or printed on an object or piece of paper somewhere next to the cat, you will receive 5 extra entries.  These extra entries per picture are cumulative, but no more than 1 per type. Maximum possible is 8 extra entries from 3 pictures. For example, if you post a cute or cool picture of a non-feline animal, and another picture of a cat, and a picture of a cat next to something with today's date written on it, you get 8 extra entries into the random number generator. If you post 2 pictures of cats next to something with today's date written on it, you only get 5 extra entries.	True

t3_s8n2o	1334355269.0	Quaquaversal	pizza-gold	[Contest] Movie Dialogue Stories 	**And . . . time! Contest is now closed. Winner is . . . springbroke! Congratulations!** I've sent a PM and hope to hear from you soon. Thank you to every one for participating; I had a lot of fun reading your stories and seeing the different directions they went in.  **Edit: A special Good Neighbour Award goes to elgreco927, who generously gave me helpful advice on how to keep the contest going even though doing so meant his entry would have more competition.** (Besides, have you *seen* how many pizzas he's given away? It's about time he received one himself ;) )  **What the contest was:**  Hello, folks! I am suddenly overcome with the desire to give away a pizza, but only after holding a totally random contest. I love cinema and I love good dialogue. There are so many great lines in so many films, that I think it's possible to build a complete story out of movie quotes. It might be a short and awkward one, but I bet it can be done, and even make sense. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to prove me accurate.    This contest is open to: US redditors who have been with Reddit for a minimum of two months, who have not received more pizzas than they have given, and who are here, reading this post to the bitter end . . . Note: I will be asking the winner for a verification code before I send anything.   The prize is an e-card from an establishment of your choice, so long as it offers e-cards.  It will cover the cost of one of their largest pizzas with as many toppings as they'll allow, a side, and a couple of drinks. Or if you win and you happen to know of a verifiable place that'll deliver to you without asking for the cardholder's ID before they hand over the food, I'll order you all of the above from there. To claim this prize, the winner must provide a verification code within 24 hours of winning, or I will go on to the next person.   It could take some time for anyone to have an entry ready, so I'm leaving the contest open until midnight (PDT, US time) on Thursday, April 19. A pizza e-card, or a delivery, will go out after I have checked out the winner's verification code. I'm aiming for April 20 for prize delivery but it depends on how this goes . . .     The challenge:       Assemble a short story mostly out of memorable movie quotes! Yay!   **The rules**  Each story must:       - contain lines from **at least** three different major blockbuster films. You can use other films, as well, but every quote has to come from ones that are/were successful and well-known in the States (I make an exception for "I reject your reality, and I substitute my own!"; the line is allowed because it is awesome).    - be fictional    - have a plot, complete with a beginning, a middle, and a real ending ("to be continued" and "it was all a dream/hallucination" won't count as endings)                           - make sense    - have characters, who speak only in movie quotes    - be family-friendly. If you need to pull in certain, shall we say, *fraught* lines from Die Hard, for example, go ahead, but please replace the pertinent word(s) with something old-fashioned, like 'dagnabbit', or a blank line.  **You can:**    - Break lines up, put in pauses, have one character start a line and another finish it, change or get rid of punctuation, have people cross-talk, and otherwise play with the words as much as you like; so long as the whole quote is in there eventually, and none of the words appears out of the order they originally showed up in in the movie.   - Use ordinary prose when you need it to hold the narrative together.  **Last rule:**  Every movie quote should be mostly unique to the movie or film franchise it came from ("Come with me if you want to live" is unique; "Good morning" isn't)  **Instant disqualification if:**   -  I can't find the quotes by searching Google or IMDB (this is why they need to come from known movies; the more obscure it is, the harder it will be to check)   - bullying occurs   - you win, but won't/don't provide a verification code                          **Copyright:** Everyone retains all rights to his or her own story or stories.     **How I'll judge**: The pizza will go to the story I enjoyed the most. It doesn't have to be long (this is for pizza, after all, not the Nobel, or an Oscar), but it does have to work.  That's all! Good luck, and thank you for reading!    EDIT: Sorry, folks! I meant to say midnight PDT, not EST, so I've adjusted that in the information above.	True

I've had a lot of really great things happen in my life lately and I haven't had many people to celebrate with.  So, I figured I'd check in here at RAOP and see who else has a reason to celebrate!  Tell me something that you have done recently that you are proud of and why it deserves a pizza.  I'll pick the winner by 6pm EST.  International entries are welcome as long as we can work out all the details (I haven't done that before, so if anyone has tips for RAOP from different countries, let me know).    *Bonus points go to people who want to order from a local pizza joint instead of the big chains...  **Edit**: I love doing contests because I get to hear a little bit about people's lives and it makes it more personal.  But, it also makes it so hard to choose!!  So, I've decided to give away 3 pizza instead of just one.  **So..congrats to adadude25, baumsquad09, and forrevgreen09 for sharing their accomplishments with RAOP!** PM me with a verification code, where you would like to order your pizza from and let's work out the details!  **Edit2**: I've been regaling my mother with tales of how cool RAOP is and how much I love giving pizza to random people.  She has decided to be a part of this and will be awarding another lucky redditor with some pizza love!  She's not currently in front of her computer, but I want to give her the option of choosing who she wants to give a pizza to, so this one will be awarded later in the evening.  Thanks to everyone for contributing! :D  **Edit3**: My mom has read everyone's submissions and decided that she would like to buy a pizza for **hello_mellow**.  PM me with a verification code and we'll work out the details! Thanks everyone, this has been fun!!	True
t3_quvit	1331663372.0	Gadianton	Kermit2	[Contest] A $15 Papa John gift card to the TOP 3 upvoted "Lunch Box Action Shots"	A few months ago I was going through a bunch of old boxes and found my kindergarden Mork and Mindy lunch box.  It was missing a handle (nothing that duct tape couldn't fix) and the thermos, but otherwise was in fine condition despite being nearly 30 years old.  So, long story short, I've been using it at work instead of brown bagging it.  Anyway, I thought it would be fun to run a contest for Lunch Box Action shots.  Here is my [example](http://imgur.com/5hn2H).  Basically, I want a picture of your lunch box or lunch carrying item at your place of work/school/whatever.    The top 3 upvoted submissions as of 3/20/12 will each get 1 $15 Papa John's Gift Card.  Just to spell out the rules:  1) It must be a lunch box for some other creative lunch carrying implement.  2) The photo must be at your work, school, or your other normal location for eating lunch.  P.S. The Dalek Alarm Clock in the background is from my Reddit 2011 Secret Santa and yes I normally eat lunch at my desk while Redditing.

And posted it, just as I have asked. Thanks for everyone who entered! :)  Ok, so I've noticed lately, that there has been a bunch of requests and saying they will pay it forward when they get money or out of debt. And then a month later, I have yet to see them post anywhere else. hrm   Just had to get that out.   Ok, so here are the contest rules. You must follow ALL of the sidebar rules. So when you are commenting on this, you must do as the sidebar follows. Yes, I will be asking for verification, so please don't PM, unless I PM you first. Sending me a PM, I will automatically block you, so no more pizza's from me. My set of rules are, I need a picture of your "partner in crime" what or whoever that may be. Today's date, your reddit name in "quotes" and a Sentence saying "The ladies of raop reddit are sexy as hell." This must be done in one, 1, uno, hana, picture. I will not take multiple pictures, if you make a mistake, edit and put up a correct picture. Lastly, this is only for people in USA, sorry for anyone living outside of USA.    I will make my announcement on here, and will send the winner(s) a PM. Please, after I announce you on here and PM you, DO NOT, PM me back, saying you are waiting for your pizza, when I'm trying to do my transactions.

t3_qow5y	1331303048.0	mcredson	beaker	[Contest] Gather around kids, its story time with Glinda and I (US Only)	Glinda_Da_Good_Witch and I are combining forces for this contest, because, why not. Up for grabs are two e gift cards. There is a $25 one for Pizza Hut and a $25 one for Dominos. Contest will end Sunday evening.      Here's how it will work. If you wish to enter simply write "playing" and which chain of the two (can be both) are around you. That way you don't end up with Dominos and the closest one is 500 miles away. The first person that responds to your "playing" post, you will then have to write a story about them and post it to the thread. This story can be a direct relation to their username, posts, etc. Keep it classy though.      Example:   Glinda_da_good_witch: Playing for Pizza Hut   Mcredson replies to her: Write a story about me!   Glinda_da_good_witch replies: [story about mcredson]      **EDIT**: For clarification, anyone can post playing, and anyone can reply to have a story written about them (just as long as you are the first). Don't be greedy, only one story can be written about you. Also, you can both write a story and have one written about you... I think that's it?      **DON'T FORGET**: Even if you are playing you can still have someone write a story about you. Right now we have a back up of people who need to write about someone!      **WINNERS**: Well, damn everyone. Didn't expect this much interest. Great stories all around, was incredibly hard to pick just two. Here are the winners... ChesireFrog won the Pizza Hut gift card and _42_ won the Dominos gift card. Honorable mention goes to Jessiebobessy, who I believe Tug said he would hook up as well! Thanks for the stories everyone!	True

t3_nml3z	1324560401.0	Dnfforever	PIF	[Contest] Guess the video games!	Simple rules, I have a list of 50 video games and they will all be represented from 1 to 50 by very obscure (or not) hints. The first person to get them all right, or the person to get the most right by the time the contest ends, wins a $30 dollar gift card to the pizza place of their choice! So start messaging me with those answers!  Also, ANSWERS POSTED ON THIS THREAD WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED! You may talk amongst yourselves to try to figure one out that you alone cannot, but other than that this thread must stay free of answers! ONE ENTRY PER USERNAME and username MUST BE A MEMBER OF REDDIT FOR A LEAST 2 MONTHS (to avoid people making multiple names to enter multiple times). If you feel like you made a mistake on one and want to correct yourself, TOO BAD! ONE ENTRY PER PERSON!  This contest will run until the ~~23rd~~ **30th** of January, and after reviewing all the entries for accuracy and tallying up the scores, the winner will be announced on the 1st of February of 2012.  For the purpose of scoring, a correct answer is worth **5 points**, an incorrect answer is worth **1 point** THIS IS NOT A TYPO!! AN INCORRECT ANSWER IS STILL WORTH SOMETHING, and no answer is worth **0 points**. And obviously, getting all answers right is an automatic win.   1. The poor guy can't enjoy his damn vacation! **Super Mario Sunshine**  2. You might think this game is Skyrim, then you'll take an arrow to the knee. **Oblivion**  3. This whole game takes place in one night. **Luigi's Mansion**  4. 3 on 3 seizure inducing arcade fighting game. **Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds**  5. I was not aware that Mr. Krab's nemesis could sing. **Electroplankton**  6. This game should've stayed in the 90s. **Duke Nukem Forever**  7. I'll give you a medal if you can actually beat this game! (2 answers accepted) **I Wanna Be The Guy OR Silver Surfer**  8. 1 day is 1 day **Animal Crossing**  9. It's hair... All of it... is hair... **Bayonetta**  10. The bad guy is a bad guy at first, then he's on your side, then turns out to be that he was the bad guy the whole time. **Prototype**  11. Better safe than sorry. **Left 4 Dead**  12. No one sleeps for a thousand years and expects to be alive when they wake up... **Final Fantasy X**  13. Awesome indie game, don't expect to beat it with the good ending on the first playthrough though... Or the second... Or third... Or fourth... **Cave Story**  14. If the bitch had kept her yap shut none of this would've happened in the first place! **The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time** (Some of you might argue this but I strongly believe that if Zelda hadn't tried to stop Ganondorf in the first place then Link wouldn't have been suspended in time for 7 years therefore allowing Ganondorf to take over)   15. Doesn't matter what choice you make, you'll always be at a disadvantage in your first match. (Any of them is fine) **Pokemon**  16. Foreigner good. **Resident Evil**  17. Oh, ba-na-na! **Donkey Kong 64**  18. Find every exit possible to beat this game with 100% completion. **Super Mario World**  19. In this series of games not only did the women characters get more boobage, they also got less clothes with each new game. **Soul Calibur series**  20. If you wanna know how this game ends, look at the fucking box. IT'S ON THE FUCKING BOX! **Final Fantasy XIII**  21. Who is Screed? And why are there two butts inside of Screed? **Assassin's Creed (Ass ass in Screed)**  22. The Fruity Tesseract **The Orange Box (A tesseract is a 4 dimensional box)**  23. CHICKEN! **Tekken**  24. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out. **Portal**  25. Why does the robotic man with the robotic eyes need sunglasses? **Deus Ex: Human Revolution**  26. ...And I'm curious to see if you can keep being a douchebag when I stick that gavel... Up your ass! **Saints Row 2**  27. I honestly think that the Peter Gunn theme was very fitting as the soundtrack for this game. **Spy Hunter**  28. The pit of a hundred trials can suck my dick... **Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door**  29. In my opinion, probably the last Kirby game made that's actually worth playing. **Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards**  30. You start playing this game with 3 of your best friends, you end this game with 3 of your worst enemies. (Any of them) **Mario Party**  31. SURE YOU'RE KEN! **Street Fighter**  32. This movie video game SUPPOSEDLY shows you what the actual movie didn't... They went a little overboard though... **The Matrix: Path of Neo**  33. The whole time I thought we were trying to save "Sarah". Who the fuck is Sarah and why are aliens and humans fighting over her??? **Gears of War** (*Sera* is the name of the planet)  34. These space pirates are a lot more fragile than they appear. **Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (But I accepted any Metroid)**  35. I never understood why the map completion in this game went up to 1000% **Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin**  36. "What time is tea time in Wonderland?" **Batman Arkham Asylum**  37. Test your might **Mortal Kombat**  38. Exiting the forest is super simple. **[Super Mario RPG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lni0rfv_CHA)**  39. Frost Insignia **Fire Emblem**  40. She's super hot and you don't even know it! Midna from **Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess**  41. Making fun of old people is easy... But it ain't dignified! **Red Dead Redemption**  42. The page turned, and the little turds grew happier. **Yoshi's Story (Obviously the game doesn't say "turds" but putting Yoshi in the hint would've made it too damn easy)**  43. I think this game was given a name at random... I've played through it one too many times and I don't ever remember going to the past. **Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past**  44. I'm looking for some sailors. **Shenmue**  45. Katon Goukakyuu No Jutsu! **Naruto (Any of them)**  46. He kills you, he copies your power, then he uses it to kill your friends... What a great guy! **Megaman (Guys... It was Megaman... I understand why you might think Kirby, but if it were Kirby I would've said "He EATS you"**  47. Is that a sunflower with big tits? **Conker's Bad Fur Day**  48. People without lives live their dream average life through the life of one of these characters... I don't see the point. **The Sims**  49. Apparently holding active explosives above your head and spinning in a circle makes them more powerful! **Bomberman**  50. My father, videos! My holy father, videos!! (Well there goes your perfect score, none of you will guess this one correctly) **[Super Smash Bros. Brawl](http://z11.invisionfree.com/The_Black_Citadel/ar/t3243.htm)** (There used to be a video attached to these lyrics but it seems that the original poster has removed it. Nonetheless the obscure reference stands and no one, NO ONE got it right... I am disappoint)  EDIT: Changed one of them to make more sense. Still same answer though.  EDIT 2: Clarified a common misconception about the scoring.  **EDIT 3: In the spirit of the games I have decided to extend how long I will accept entries! You guys now have til January 30th to get your entries in! That's one more week than originally stated so get those entries in for a chance to win a $30 gift card to the pizza place of your choice!!**  **EDIT 4: For every 2 consecutive correct answers you get a bonus 5 points. So let's say you get 7 in a row correctly your points would go as follows 5+5+10+10+15+15+20 and so on until you get a wrong answer. This is to make things a little more interesting! And not to worry... EVERYONE'S POINTS HAVE BEEN TALLIED THIS WAY! Also because of this the max score has gone up from 250 to 3250** ______________________________________________________________________________________________ *THE WINNER OF THIS FANTASTIC CONTEST IS DRUMROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL* **TheTuninator!** *With a fantastic score of 279 points! SO COME ON UP AND CLAIM YOUR PRIZE YOU BIG WINNER YOU! xD*	True

The username and the cat have to be in the same picture (and the username should be *in* the picture, not photoshopped on), but the cat doesn't have to belong to the entrant - a picture of a friend's cat, or a cat at a local shelter, or a fluffy-maned lion from a nearby zoo would all be valid entries.  Entries should be submitted by noon EST on Nov. 10th, a week from today. That also happens to be my birthday, which may affect my judgement of the entries, especially if there's a tie of some sort. Just so you know. :)  ---  **Winner:** ExtraordinaryGirl! Boozer is Very Fluffy, and also shares my disdain for early Christmas stuff. ^.^	True

The judging will be done by any user with a pizza icon (giver) or a custom icon (repeat giver).   Just add a comment on the sub-thread of the pic you like best and that will count as a vote.  Upvoting the pic won't count for obvious reasons.  The votes will be tallied on Monday at 3pm PDT and it's Monday evening pizza for the winner.  **[EDIT]considering the wise words of JetBoyTerp, let's say that this contest requires at least 5 entrants before it's complete.  So it may end up going longer than tomorrow...**  **[EDIT2]  Ok - me and the mrs and the kid couldn't agree.

t3_kvd0u	1317310561.0	jetboyterp	jetboyterp	[Contest] It's that time again...	OK, new contest.    Think about this:  You are a country.  Meaning you, personally.  Think about what the flag of the country of you might look like.  Flag design should reflect your personality, likes, etc...something(s) about and representative about you.  Go [HERE](http://artpad.art.com/artpad/painter/), click on the logo somewhere, and draw your flag there.  When done, click *save & send* then click on the right side, halfway down the box where it says *for link only click here*.  Copy/paste that link in this thread.  That's it!  There will be two winners.  One $30 gift card, winner chosen on sheer awesomeness of their flag execution and design, and one $20 gift card, for the "not so artistic" amongst RAoP, winner chosen for my perceived time and effort you put into your design, and it being a cool flag.  So you don't have to be an artist to win a gift card.  Card will be good for Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Papa John's (your choice) and winner will be chosen tomorrow evening, Friday, at 7pm EDT on Sept. 30th.  Any questions about the artpad site, the contest requirements or further explanation, or how to link, let me know in the comments.    Cheers, and good luck!   **Edited for spelling.  ****EDIT 2**:  (Thu, 2:40pm) Wow, some really cool ones in already...everyone's on the right track for sure.   ****EDIT 3**:  (Thu, 7:05pm) Whoa...there's a few that raise the bar there.   Remember tho, there's two card, one for the obvious arteests, and one for the no-so-obvious Picasso.    ****EDIT 4**:  (Fri, 11:00am)  lotta entries...I may have to recruit some help judging...8 more hours to go...  ****EDIT 5**:  (Fri, 5:00pm)  Going over everything...I'd do this early, but if someone's working on one, I gotta be fair and keep it to 7pm.    ****FINAL**:  Cheers to all the entrants!  It was tough, but here are the winners...  $30 gift card goes to [resolutionsz](http://artpad.art.com/gallery/?lsb381m9vd0) !  Awesome work there!  $20 gift card, after deliberating between three, goes to [razzmatazz1313](http://artpad.art.com/gallery/?lsbkd554nrg) !

I can't draw anything decent to save my life. As such, I'm requesting you make some sort of art, and trust me, it can be god-awful. I like to laugh, I'm a fan stick figures. Rage comics are boring, don't do that.  &nbsp;  Only rules: Needs to relate to two photos, and have either my username or yours with the submission.   &nbsp;  First photo: [Myself, in China, doing what I do for a living.](http://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/s720x720/189442_747909007567_37606829_38879036_447129_n.jpg)  Second photo: [My kick-ass dog.](http://i.imgur.com/tFcPV.jpg)  &nbsp;  In theory, this will be for Monday evening, after I get back from classes (7 pm est). There's a chance the direct deposit on my check won't go through until Tuesday, so the ending time is a bit open-ended.  &nbsp;  With that said, make me laugh. I'm going to bed now, but I will see every submission. The amount of upvotes you get really has no bearing other than other people liking it, so please, if you see your fellow-contest-entrants with something funny, upvote it.  edit: Damnit, I meant to put this in earlier, but, United States. Sorry.	True
