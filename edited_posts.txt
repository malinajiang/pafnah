Edit: I also have some Wii games(and GC games as I've been trying to sell it all for money). Mario galaxy 2, mario bros wii, and a ton of GC games. Paper mario, luigis mansion, zelda, the good stuff. 

I also have Reddit friends that could confirm what I've said above^ So I don't look like some random dude just wanting free food. Thanks for consideration.

Edit: It says "Alone". I recently moved to Seattle with no friends, and no family. 
Edit: That sounds too dismal, it's just boring.

I will return the favor with a pie later on this month. I love everything about RAOP and if someone helps me right now, I'd love to help in the future. I can provide a picture of me Omnoming it when it arrives. 
Thanks guys! &lt;3

EDIT :Also I don't have family...so there will be no thanksgiving meal for me this year, this would really be a nice happy thing, I could use it right at the moment :-( And PapaJohns is the chain we have here.

EDIT: This really would mean so much to me guys, I've never had to deal with getting a tooth pulled before and my face is just returning to normal, the last thing I need right now is stress, I have two others that live with me who haven't been able to find a job because of the economy so I'm the only one who works, this is going to put is in a tight spot and I'm still not sure how things are going to go but for tonight, the first night I have the ability to even have solid food, I don't want to worry.  Also if interested I can provide a picture of a very doofy looking dog, possibly two in exchange.

EDIT: If anyone's been in a facility for this before and wouldn't mind telling me what it was like, feel free to PM me.Thanks

EDIT2: I wasn't quite clear, I wanted to give him the pizza when he gets out. I'm happy to provide verification as well (I assume he'll work with me a bit in giving you guys like a hospital slip of some sort).

EDIT3: Verification for anyone who's interested, and wants to see the admission slip: http://imgur.com/fCkEnHK,eLaTaLI

He's coming home today or tomorrow.

Thanks everyone for the support.

Edit: [Pizza came](http://i.imgur.com/SC3RC.jpg). Wish I could put into words how grateful I am and how unexpected it was to see not 1, but 4 pizzas come..this will last me a while. Thank you. I'm not even sure what else to say besides thank you a hundred times. This is the nicest thing anyone has done for me in quite some time.

Edit:  I received a gift card from a fellow redditor.  Thank you so much for the generosity!  I will definitely pay it forward when I get a chance.

I was out of state for a semester of school and returned a few weeks ago.  I was finally offered a job on Friday but I still have to wait for background checks to go through before I can officially start next week (or so).

I'm babysitting my nieces for my brother who happens to work at a dealership across from my apartment so any food will go towards feeding the girls and my brother as well.  My brother is also trying to get back on his feet as well after a divorce so he is unable to pay me for watching the kids.

Now, after that sob story, I will say we are not DYING for food.  If you find someone else in greater need, by all means help them first.  Food would greatly help me save money until I officially start my job, considering I still have to wait another 2-3 weeks for a paycheck to come in.  If I do receive any food, I definitely plan to pay it forward once I am more financially stable.  

This turned out a whole lot longer than I planned.  I would appreciate any help. Thanks!

*Edit:** 

The good news: A very kind person who wished to remain anonymous sent me a $20 e-gift card to Pizza Hut!

The bad news: Even though I live in New York freakin' City, there is no pizza hut close enough that delivers to me! And I don't have a car. So, as of right now, I am unable to use it.

The second good news: I am moving soon. So, I will either use this in the near future or I will just pass it on to some other individual in need!

So, thank you RAOP! I am pretty happy right now, even though I am not eating pizza at the moment!

EDIT: OH! I'm an artist so I would be willing to draw any random thing for free pizza (dont expect it to be like mind-blowingly amazing but I will definitely try to make it cool!) if interest is shown in that avenue, I can link to my photobucket to show my style and see if there is still an interest. thanks all!
